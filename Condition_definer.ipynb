    "Ask for the definition of a medical term, and get a response that is reconciled between multiple web sources.  For an MVP, the web app will allow the user to enter 'heart attack' and get a machine generated reconciled definition from Wikipedia, WebMD, and MayoClinic.  Future iterations would include adding the ability to search more medical terms, using more sources with which to reconcile the requested definition, as well as including symptoms, causes, treatments, and risk factors.  Additional future iterations will include comparing sources with conflicting results with the established \"training set\" of sources.  These conflicting sources can be documented for additional scrutinization."

       "u'Myocardial infarction (MI) or acute myocardial infarction (AMI), commonly known as a heart attack, occurs when blood flow stops to a part of the heart causing damage to the heart muscle. The most common symptom is chest pain or discomfort which may travel into the shoulder, arm, back, neck, or jaw. Often it is in the center or left side of the chest and lasts for more than a few minutes. The discomfort may occasionally feel like heartburn. Other symptoms may include shortness of breath, nausea, feeling faint, a cold sweat, or feeling tired.[1] About 30% of people have atypical symptoms,[2] with women more likely than men to present atypically.[3] Among those over 75 years old, about 5% have had an MI with little or no history of symptoms.[4] An MI may cause heart failure, an irregular heartbeat, or cardiac arrest.[5][6]'"

      "Myocardial infarction (MI) or acute myocardial infarction (AMI), commonly known as a heart attack, occurs when blood flow stops to a part of the heart causing damage to the heart muscle. The most common symptom is chest pain or discomfort which may travel into the shoulder, arm, back, neck, or jaw. Often it is in the center or left side of the chest and lasts for more than a few minutes. The discomfort may occasionally feel like heartburn. Other symptoms may include shortness of breath, nausea, feeling faint, a cold sweat, or feeling tired.[1] About 30% of people have atypical symptoms,[2] with women more likely than men to present atypically.[3] Among those over 75 years old, about 5% have had an MI with little or no history of symptoms.[4] An MI may cause heart failure, an irregular heartbeat, or cardiac arrest.[5][6]\n",
