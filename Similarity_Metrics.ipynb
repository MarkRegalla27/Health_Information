      "['Vitamin B3 is made up of niacin and niacinamide, and can be found in many foods, including yeast, meat, fish, milk, eggs, green vegetables, and cereal grains. Vitamin B3 is often found in combination with other B vitamins, including thiamine, riboflavin, pantothenic acid, pyridoxine, cyanocobalamin, and folic acid.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved niacin for use in treating vitamin B3 deficiency (pellagra), which includes symptoms of skin inflammation, dementia, and diarrhea.Human research has shown that niacin is effective and relatively safe for treating high cholesterol levels. Limited evidence shows that niacin may help with clogged arteries and heart disease. Side effects commonly related to higher doses of niacin are itching, flushing, and stomach upset. Niacin may also cause liver problems, increased blood sugar, and hormone changes.', 'Tresorie - A PLEA FOR EARLY OPERATION IN PLEURISY WITH EFFUSION [Early\\nOperation In Pleurisy With Effusion]\\n\\n TWO articles appearing recently-the one\\n      by Dr. Barrs, in the British Medical Journal, dealing more especially with\\n      the dire results of pleuritic effusion, the other by Dr. Lindsay, in the\\n      Lancet, touching more on the advisability of early interference in such\\n      cases-have brought out very suggestive points for us to consider.\\n      \\n It is, however, with some hesitation\\n      that I have undertaken to direct the attention of this Society to so\\n      familiar and well nigh hackneyed a subject as pleural effusion and\\n      empyema. I feel somewhat at case, though, in doing so, because the disease\\n      in question, however familiar, possesses and exceptional clinical\\n      interest, and because there are many points in its ultimate pathology,\\n      perhaps aetiology-and more especially its treatment- around which much\\n      controversy has raged and is still raging. It is out of the question to\\n      handle exhaustively so vast a subject as pleural effusion and empyema. I\\n      will therefore limit my remarks.\\n      \\n There can be no doubt, in my opinion,\\n      that there is a strong and growing tendency to employ operative measures\\n      by those who see much pleurisy, and who are able to keep track of these\\n      sufferers for months or years after their original attack.\\n      \\n It is only in this collective method\\n      that we shall be able to speak pro and con for early operative methods.\\n      \\n As the best thinking and scientific\\n      minds of the Old and some of the New School are busying themselves most\\n      with preventive medicine, and then with curative medicine, it seems to us\\n      that a more fitting field for such investigations does not exist than in\\n      the one under discussion.\\n      \\n In orthopaedic surgery much has been\\n      learned and discovered within the past ten years-recognizing disease early\\n      (by experts), by suitable appliances rectifying deformities, and if they\\n      already exist, minimizing them to a marked degree.\\n      \\n In pleurisy a similar picture should\\n      the presented.\\n      \\n Unrecognized pleurisy, or pleuritis\\n      with effusion, maltreated leads to a maiming of the lung, its disability\\n      to perform more than one-third of its proper work, phthisis and lateral\\n      curvature of the spine, etc.\\n      \\n Curative medicine, then, in such cases\\n      must be looked for in two directions: first, as a power to promote\\n      recovery from injury of external origin; secondly, as a power to mitigate\\n      or remove diseases arising within the body.\\n      \\n And again, we are led in such cases by\\n      our old habits of thought to regard life as a thing of the body alone, and\\n      to forget that life lies between the body and the medium, and is, as it\\n      were, a play of activities between two surfaces, so that the medium needs\\n      as much curative vigilance as the body does, and is far more within our\\n      power and comprehension.\\n      \\n Therefore the prominent, and often even\\n      exclusive, place given to the administration of medicines and the\\n      swallowing of drugs is not only questionable, but positively mischievous,\\n      in so far as it leads the public, not to mention ourselves, to attach\\n      primary importance to measures at best auxiliary, and in so far as it\\n      blinds us to the far greater importance of studying the earlier and lesser\\n      deviation of function, and of readjusting the conditions under which the\\n      individual lives exist.\\n      \\n Those of us who may have made many\\n      post-mortems or witnessed them attentively, must have been impressed with\\n      the great frequency with which adhesive pleuritis was met.\\n      \\n And it seems to me that it matters\\n      little where these adhesions are found, but that they must represent just\\n      so much mechanical interference with the act of respiration and\\n      interchange of oxygenation during the act of respiration.\\n      \\n To properly understand the gravity of\\n      all pleuritic effusion we should appreciate somewhat the pathology of such\\n      cases.\\n      \\n The changes which take place in an\\n      inflamed pleura are essentially the same as those met in other serous\\n      membranes. The earliest stages are indicated by capillary congestion, and\\n      sometimes ecchymotic spots in the subserous tissue, with extravasations of\\n      blood into the pleura itself; the membrane then loses its smooth, glossy\\n      surface, becoming rough, dull and opaque, and is soon covered by a\\n      delicate gray deposit, consisting of fibrin, epithelium and young cells,\\n      and as this deposit increases apparently layer by layer, it becomes\\n      yellowish in color.\\n      \\n These changes are observed both on the\\n      parietal and pulmonary pleura.\\n      \\n In the rare cases in which a more or\\n      less diffused pleuritis stops here, and is not followed by liquid\\n      effusion, the inflammatory products are either entirely absorbed, or-which\\n      occurs most frequently-the opposing surfaces become adherent in whole or\\n      in part by organized connective tissue, and the sac is obliterated over\\n      the adherent areas.\\n      \\n Complete obliteration over the bases is\\n      seen chiefly in severe and long standing cases, where absorption has been\\n      left to its own judgment, or after empyema.\\n      \\n Mehu and Laboulbene have justly\\n      maintained that the ultimate recovery of the patient will proceed more\\n      slowly or more rapidly, according as the exudations are more or less\\n      fibrinous.\\n      \\n The next step to congestion and\\n      fibrinous exudation is the effusion of fluid.\\n      \\n All pleuritic effusions lead naturally\\n      to a number of local and general pathological conditions, partly owing to\\n      the quantity and quality of the exudations themselves, and partly in\\n      consequence of the changes which these exudations gradually undergo. The\\n      amount of the exudation will limit the amount of the compression of the\\n      subjacent organs, as the mediastinum, the opposite lung, the great venous,\\n      arterial, and nervous trunks, the diaphragm, the chest wall, liver,\\n      stomach, etc.\\n      \\n In fibrino-effusions-which frequently\\n      met with at the onset of all pleurisies-recovery commences in most cases\\n      by the gradual concentration of the exudation. In consequence of this the\\n      absorption proceeds much more rapidly at the beginning than it does later\\n      on. Finally, the fluid portion of the exudation may entirely disappear,\\n      and the pleural surfaces, roughened by deposits, come again in contact and\\n      often become fused together.\\n      \\n If the process of absorption sets in\\n      sufficiently early, the compressed lung again becomes permeable to air and\\n      re-expands.\\n      \\n We must still form an accurate idea of\\n      the anatomical changes which arise in those chronic cases in which the\\n      exudative deposits become organized into connective-tissue masses.\\n      \\n In the course of the pleuritis we not\\n      repeated exudations taking place which undergo organization, harden, and\\n      finally are found in layers sometimes an inch in thickness.\\n      \\n The serous and sub-serous tissues are\\n      often merged into this new formation, and are hard to distinguish from it.\\n      \\n If the pleura pulmonalis is affected,\\n      it always appears thicker on section and shrunk on the surface.\\n      \\n This leads to a shrinking and\\n      retraction of the subjacent lung tissue, the hilus of the lung forming the\\n      centre of the retraction, while the margins of the lung become rounded by\\n      this pleuritis deformans.\\n      \\n This retraction leaves a free space in\\n      the pleural cavity which becomes filled with fluid, which has little\\n      chance of being absorbed the thicker the two pleural surfaces become. The\\n      pleura, in such a state, rapidly loses its absorbent power.\\n      \\n Thus the capability of expansion in\\n      such a lung is forever last.\\n      \\n Again, if the pleura becomes covered\\n      with thick false membranes while there is still considerable effusion in\\n      the pleural cavity, and before its absorption has been possible, this\\n      circumstance hinders its further absorption, and the remainder of the\\n      exudation may thus remain for months or years encapsulated.\\n      \\n The thicker and more fibrous the false\\n      membranes, the less vascular are they.\\n      \\n This organized false membrane sometimes\\n      assumes a pyogenic character, from which pus is continuously secreted.\\n      When the fluid effused in the earlier stages of the disease becomes\\n      absorbed and no new liquid (serous or purulent) effusions are poured out\\n      between the layers of exudation, the lung must, in such cases of pleuritis\\n      deformans, diminish more and more in size.\\n      \\n The adjacent movable organs, as well as\\n      the thoracic walls, must contribute to the filling up of this vacuum.\\n      \\n The different character of the\\n      effusions, whether serous, sero-fibrinous, purulent or haemorrhagic, all\\n      have their important significance.\\n      \\n Anstie and Wagner, from clinical and\\n      microscopical work, have found that these false membranes develop more\\n      freely at first when the opposing surfaces are kept apart by the effused\\n      liquids. The running of the two pleurae together seem to impede the\\n      process of organization.\\n      \\n Wagner betones the fact that these\\n      newly-organized and vascular tissues often become the starting-points of\\n      fresh inflammatory processes and of new products.\\n      \\n\\n      \\n The question, then, now which presents\\n      itself to us, after digesting the foregoing opinions of the most reliable\\n      authors upon the constant tendency for pleuritis with effusion to leave\\n      the lung damaged, is, whether we should be satisfied with remedial\\n      measures until the patient is nearly in extremis, or shall we, by a timely\\n      and simple operative procedure, speedily restore our patient to perfect\\n      health by removing in exudation which is seldom able to leave the organ as\\n      it found it.\\n      \\n Professor Nothnagel tells us that\\n      \"a cure consists in so modifying pathological processes-be they\\n      chemical or physical, functional or dynamic-as not only to arrest them,\\n      but to restore to a state of physiological and anatomical integrity the\\n      organs and tissues that have been deranged. The cure (sometimes) can only\\n      take place through vital organic processes, and to medicine belongs the\\n      task of determining what outside support can be rendered to the vis\\n      medicatrix naturae.\".\\n      \\n The large majority of physicians and\\n      surgeons are opposed to operations in pleuritis with effusion during its\\n      acme and feverish state. If the orthopnoea becomes intense, the effusion\\n      increases rapidly, etc., they may become convinced of the necessity of an\\n      immediate relief through aspiration or incision.\\n      \\n In times I feel assured that all\\n      pleurisies will be treated by operation where an effusion exists.\\n      \\n The eminent authority on this subject,\\n      Dr. Bowditch, of Boston, lays down the rule that if the dyspnoea is\\n      excessive, so as to amount to permanent orthopnoea, or if I learn that\\n      within a few hours previous to my visit there has been even one attack of\\n      momentary orthopnoea, during which the patient felt the breath would be\\n      wholly lost, I tap immediately, provided I am sure that there is even a\\n      quantity of fluid in the pleural cavity, and that it is, apparently, the\\n      chief, or perhaps only, cases of the orthopnoea. \"I fear,\" he\\n      adds, \"death may occur before my next visit.\" He states, further\\n      on, that \"when a patient comes under notice in whom a large quantity\\n      of fluid has been long effused, I advise thoracocentesis as the first\\n      remedy.\" .\\n      \\n During the past year I have seen three\\n      cases of pleurisy die suddenly for the want of immediate evacuation of the\\n      pleural sac.\\n      \\n In such cases, even during the febrile\\n      stages, thoracocentesis seems to me the only remedy. Barnes says, \"It\\n      is my practice to operate at once when the chest is two parts filled with\\n      fluid, without waiting for urgent dyspnoea.\".\\n      \\n The propriety of operating in large\\n      effusions is being rapidly accepted by the profession generally, but there\\n      is considerable difference of opinion, even among enthusiasts for the\\n      operation, of the demand or advisability of interfering: 1st, during the\\n      febrile stage, and 2d, where moderate effusion remains unabsorbed. During\\n      the febrile stage it is maintained by many that the fluid would at once\\n      reform, and, furthermore, that the surgical treatment might excite\\n      additional inflammatory action. We have very strong evidence to prove that\\n      this is not correct.\\n      \\n For example, Castiaux (1873, These de\\n      Paris) chains that the operation by aspiration will hasten the cure of\\n      acute pleurisy and prevent the formation of the fibrinous deposits and\\n      bands which in nearly all cases, even in moderate effusion, impair the\\n      expansion of the lungs. He operated 37 cases, and cured them. The pulse\\n      and temperature fell within twenty-four hours of the operation, and the\\n      patients improved rapidly.\\n      \\n As soon as fluid was detected he\\n      operated by aspiration points, feeling that he had at his disposition sure\\n      means of relief which are harmless or nearly so, and that it is useless to\\n      leave this task to nature, which she so often cannot accomplish even in a\\n      half-way satisfactory manner. Medication is often untrustworthy in such\\n      conditions.\\n      \\n He operated at the height of the first\\n      or inflammatory stage.\\n      \\n In operating thus promptly the relieved\\n      the lung of compression, which must impair its expansion; he removed an\\n      effusion rich in fibrine and capable of increasing, in time, the thickness\\n      of the neo-membranes; he restored the power to the lung to dilate by\\n      removing this tendency to false membrane formation, which squeezes the\\n      lung tissue.\\n      \\n These membranes cannot become\\n      organized, as I have stated before, as long as they are separated by\\n      fluid.\\n      \\n He drew off all the fluid he could. The\\n      relief to the patient was often most marked. The lung expanded promptly\\n      and satisfactorily, as shown by auscultation. In a few cases the effusion\\n      returned, with an increased pulse and rise of temperature; another\\n      aspiration effectually arrested the process.\\n      \\n The cases treated in this fashion\\n      lasted a much shorter time, and apparently no false membrane supervened.\\n      \\n No accident occurred in any of his\\n      cases, and he never saw as a result of the operation the transformation of\\n      the serosity into pus.\\n      \\n We have nearly as strong testimony in\\n      some cases reported by Moutard-Martin. He operated in twelve cases, of\\n      about ten days\\' standing, with sero-fibrinous effusions, accompanied by\\n      fever. In eight there was no reproduction, in four it was very slight, and\\n      in none did it become purulent. On the other hand, in cases in existence\\n      from twenty to sixty days the fluid was always moderately reproduced.\\n      \\n He insists upon the prompt withdrawal\\n      of the fluid as the most successful method, more especially if we suspect\\n      the formation of false membranes.\\n      \\n Wedal\\'s results are even more\\n      remarkable than those of Castiaux or Moutard-Martin.\\n      \\n He considered puncture harmless during\\n      the acute stage, and claims it shows a hastening of the cure.\\n      \\n He operated seventeen times on\\n      seventeen patients form the second to the fifth day, and three times from\\n      the eighth to the tenth.\\n      \\n In acute cases, where the patients had\\n      no pulmonary or bronchial disease, the cure was not protracted beyond the\\n      twelfth day. Some were cured by the sixth. His clients were mostly young,\\n      vigorous men.\\n      \\n Dr. J. L. Mason tells us that in one\\n      hundred and thirty-two cases, where no operation was performed, the\\n      duration of the disease extended over weeks, and, in some cases, months.\\n      \\n What a comparison to draw between\\n      Castiaux, Widal, Moutard- Martin, and those cases of Mason.\\n      \\n Wedal thinks the earlier the operation\\n      is done, the more successful it is likely to be.\\n      \\n Dieulafoy thinks we should wait until\\n      the fever ceases.\\n      \\n According to Wilson Fox, the density of\\n      the adhesions and false membranes is determined within the first fortnight\\n      of the effusion.\\n      \\n As to the aetiology of pleurisy, we\\n      will content ourselves with making the inquiry: It is due to exposure,\\n      rheumatism, or tubercle? Dr. Lindsay found, in thirty-five cases, sixteen\\n      of them due to a wetting or exposure to cold while the patient was\\n      overheated. Rheumatism was present in three instances. In two cases there\\n      was a family history of tubercle, and in three haemoptysis of pulmonary\\n      origin. In ten cases, or nearly one- third, no cause could be found.\\n      Organic heart disease does not seem to induce pleurisy.\\n      \\n The relation of tuberculosis to acute\\n      pleurisy is the most important and difficult one.\\n      \\n Dr. Barrs, in a noteworthy article,\\n      shows that a very large number of cases of simple pleural effusion are\\n      really of tubercular origin.\\n      \\n He hunted up the after-history of\\n      seventy-four cases of simple pleural effusion, and found within five years\\n      thirty-two of these were dead, twenty-five were living, and seventeen\\n      could not be found. Of the thirty-two reported dead, fourteen died of\\n      phthisis, four died of other tubercular affections, and several of the\\n      others succumbed to some pulmonary affection.\\n      \\n Leaving out those who could not be\\n      traced in Dr. Barrs\\'s report, we have the astounding fact that more than\\n      one-half, apparently recovering from a simple pleural effusion, died\\n      within five years, and these mainly of some tuberculous affection.\\n      \\n It seems but a fair inference that if\\n      these statements are correct and are fairly typical and should be\\n      corroborated by others and by wider knowledge and experience, that the\\n      ultimate prognosis in simple pleural effusion, so far from being, as it is\\n      now commonly regarded, as distinctly favorable, would become most grave.\\n      \\n In Dr. Lindsay\\'s 35 cases only two\\n      instances of a family history of tubercle existed and only three instance\\n      of pulmonary haemorrhage. In others the presence of tubercle was\\n      suspected, but was not absolutely proven.\\n      \\n The association of pleurisy and\\n      tubercle is, therefore. more common than we are in the habit of believing.\\n      \\n The question raised by Dr. Barrs is one\\n      of the most important in medicine, and each one of us should sift it to\\n      the bottom.\\n      \\n If, then, a patient who has had an\\n      attack of acute pleurisy subsequently develops tuberculosis, the question\\n      arises whether the pleurisy was originally of tubercular origin or whether\\n      the damage suffered by the pleura and lung have not invited a tuberculosis\\n      which did not exist prior to the pleuritis.\\n      \\n I incline myself more strongly to the\\n      latter opinion.\\n      \\n The method of the treatment of the\\n      pleuritic effusion is here often the cause of the dire results we see\\n      following such processes.\\n      \\n All my practical knowledge of pulmonary\\n      phthisis inclines me to the belief that if a lung be left collapsed and\\n      inexpansile and bound down, as the result of pleural effusion, it is very\\n      likely to become the seat of tuberculosis, and that the development of\\n      tuberculosis under such circumstances is no proof that the underlying\\n      process was tubercular from the first.\\n      \\n I must further make the statement that\\n      in dealing with the great number of cases of pulmonary phthisis which come\\n      under my observation, I have been more and more impressed by the frequency\\n      with which pleurisy is found as an antecedent condition.\\n      \\n This is a fact which we cannot and\\n      should not ignore.\\n      \\n It is to be much regretted that we have\\n      no satisfactory records to show us what is the normal course of pleuritic\\n      effusions-moderate and large-without treatment. The tendency is probably\\n      to a spontaneous subsidence-quoad the effusion per se- and the great\\n      practical question is whether, by the administration of drugs or operative\\n      interference, we can materially hasten the cure. It is now generally\\n      admitted that many of the methods of elimination formerly in vogue by the\\n      Old School are either useless or injurious.\\n      \\n The testimony of those employing early\\n      puncture or advocating early operation gives a far different note of hope\\n      to the aggressive element in the profession.\\n      \\n The great question, then, for us in\\n      this connection to settle is, not whether aspiration should be performed,\\n      but how soon must it be done?.\\n      \\n In certain cases where the effusion is\\n      large and the dulness ascends as high as the second rib in front, or if\\n      the measurement of the affected side be markedly increased, much dyspnoea,\\n      etc., the advantage of aspiration cannot for a moment be disputed.\\n      \\n I maintain that we should not allow our\\n      patient to come to such a pass.\\n      \\n Those cases which present the most\\n      difficulty of decision are where we have a moderate effusion with or\\n      without fever and with or without dyspnoea or other disturbing symptoms.\\n      In such cases the inquiries arise: 1. Does aspiration lessen the chance of\\n      a speedy or remote fatal issue? and 2. Does aspiration shorten the\\n      duration of the disease, with the immediate prospects of restoring the\\n      affected parts to a condition of perfect physiological action?.\\n      \\n The first question may be somewhat\\n      summarily dismissed as to a sudden fatal issue where the effusion is\\n      moderate, but as to a remote fatal issue, where the accumulation has been\\n      in existence some time, our judgment must be reserved.\\n      \\n The second inquiry is a very\\n      interesting one, but the difficulty of absolutely determining it is very\\n      great.\\n      \\n It seems to me that the duration of the\\n      malady, in answering the second query, must first be taken into\\n      consideration.\\n      \\n In cases of several weeks\\' standing I\\n      believe the lung-and ergo its pleural surface-never returns to a healthy\\n      condition.\\n      \\n We must take cognizance, though, in\\n      this discussion, of the literature dealing with it. It must shape the\\n      judgment of the inexperienced and give a strong support to the man of\\n      large experience either pro or con.\\n      \\n One practitioner inclines to tap early\\n      in all cases, and to repeat it, if necessary, and his statistics will show\\n      the greatest number of recoveries and the shortest duration of illness.\\n      His remote results will be the most satisfactory fro a medical, surgical\\n      and prognostic point of view.\\n      \\n Another practitioner reserves operation\\n      for serious cases with large effusions, or for chronic or semi-chronic\\n      cases. His remote results will be the most unsatisfactory from a medical,\\n      surgical and prognostic point of view.\\n      \\n In empyema most writers agree that\\n      aspiration is not the method to employ, but that free incision, with\\n      drainage, is the recognized operation in American and the results quoad\\n      vitam are most gratifying.\\n      \\n In children we should note the marked\\n      tendency for pleuritic effusions to becomes purulent.\\n      \\n As a summary we would state:.\\n      \\n I. That aspiration carried out\\n      antiseptically in any stage of pleuritic effusion is not a dangerous\\n      procedure.\\n      \\n II. More people die from a postponed\\n      aspiration than from any operative interference.\\n      \\n III. Anstie and Weber have shown that\\n      organization of the fibrinous portion of the effusion can proceed very\\n      slowly and imperfectly when the two pleural surfaces are allowed to play\\n      on each other. Effusion separating the two surfaces hastens the formation\\n      of neo-membranes.\\n      \\n IV. Aspiration shortens the illness to\\n      fourteen or eighteen days.\\n      \\n V. Pleuritis without operation and with\\n      moderate effusion lasts seldom shorter than three weeks, and from that up\\n      to two months.\\n      \\n VI. With aspiration, the lung pleurae\\n      in very recent cases return to a physiological state.\\n      \\n VII. In semi-chronic, chronic and\\n      purulent effusions portions of the pleura and lung are permanently damaged\\n      and lead to one form, perhaps the most frequent, of phthisis.\\n      \\n VIII. Early aspiration is growing in\\n      favor, and I have witnessed several brilliant cures in my own practice and\\n      that of others.\\n      \\n IX. In three cases of large effusion\\n      seen in consultation, the operation being postponed until the following\\n      day, the patient has expired suddenly in the night.\\n      \\n DISCUSSION.\\n      \\n OSCAR LESEURE, M.D.: I am heartily in\\n      sympathy with the principles advanced in Dr. Schley\\'s paper, and will\\n      refer to them specially from the surgical standpoint.\\n      \\n I have failed to find an authority who\\n      does not admit the fact that the sooner a lung oppressed by pleuritic\\n      effusion is relieved from compression, the more completely will that lung\\n      be restored to its normal anatomical and physiological condition.\\n      \\n The opposition to early, or any,\\n      operation for the relief of pleuritic effusions (and in this sense I refer\\n      to serous or sero- fibrinous effusion and the operation of aspiration) is\\n      based mainly upon the accidents which have accompanied or immediately\\n      followed the operation, and which have very unjustly, in many instances,\\n      been attributed to it, or on the accidents which might theoretically\\n      complicate the process.\\n      \\n It is true that the mortality\\n      accompanying the early history of thoracocentesis was discouraging. Boyer\\n      and Gendrin lost 100 per cent.; Dupuytren, 96 per cent.; Davis, 33 per\\n      cent. (Donaldson). But from the time when Trousseau urged and practiced\\n      thoracocentesis with the trocar of Reybard, and Bowditch first used the\\n      method of aspiration, down to the present day, the statistics of the\\n      operation have so improved that Matas, in 1892, records over one thousand\\n      cases without a death.\\n      \\n Of the more important accidents\\n      attributed to the operation, we may enumerate the following: Injury to the\\n      intercostal vessels and nerves; injury of the liver, peritoneum, heart, or\\n      lungs; syncope; cerebral accidents, as paralysis and convulsions; cough\\n      and albuminous expectoration; purulent transformation.\\n      \\n We many dismiss the question of injury\\n      to the intercostal vessels and nerves by saying that, given a knowledge of\\n      their location, the average intercostal space, a proper instrument and\\n      reasonable skill, the objection should have no weight.\\n      \\n Injury to the liver, peritoneum, heart,\\n      or lungs we cannot dismiss so lightly, for, with the distinguished names\\n      of Aran and Claude Bernardo associated with these accidents, we must admit\\n      their importance. Still, with the advanced knowledge and improved methods\\n      of to-day; with the results of experience in selecting the point of\\n      puncture; also the proof from the statistics just quoted, we may consider\\n      the importance of this objection to be in its warning to the operator.\\n      \\n Of four cases of syncope occurring at\\n      the time or immediately following the operation, analyzed by Vergely,\\n      Guyot, Chaillou, and Besnier, one was due to heart clot, one to pulmonary\\n      embolus, one to phlebitis and thrombosis, and one to pulmonary gangrene.\\n      Bowditch and Donaldson have also attributed the accident to the\\n      complications existing at the time of the operation.\\n      \\n This accident might be due, also, to a\\n      too rapid evacuation of the fluid, thus suddenly depleting the cerebral\\n      vessels. A skilful operation will, therefore, remove the only just part of\\n      this objection.\\n      \\n Cerebral accidents are: paralysis, due\\n      to an embolus not directly traceable to the operation, or convulsions\\n      possibly due to a disturbed intracranial pressure, in turn attributable to\\n      a too rapid or complete evacuation of the effused fluid.\\n      \\n Cough, with albuminous expectoration,\\n      due to acute oedema of the lung, is justly charged to the operation, but\\n      is a dangerous condition only when the operator rashly disregards the\\n      warning which is given him, and which was so clearly described in the\\n      interesting paper presented to you by Prof. Biggar on Wednesday evening. I\\n      refer to the irritating cough, sometimes accompanied by dyspnoea, which\\n      may occur during the evacuation of the fluid. That it is an acute oedema\\n      of the pulmonary tissue has been demonstrated by Herard, Dieulafoy,\\n      Lavaran, Tissier, Moutard- Martin, Dujardin-Beaumetz, and others, and by\\n      them ascribed to a too rapid removal of the intra-pleural fluid, which, in\\n      turn, produces an extensive congestion of the lung suddenly freed from\\n      pressure.\\n      \\n Purulent transformation of the fluid\\n      remaining after aspiration is the objections most strenuously advanced by\\n      surgeons who oppose the operation. Late microscopical and bacteriological\\n      researches promise to prove the predictions of Fraenkel and Netter to be\\n      well founded, viz., that an early examination of the fluid effused will\\n      determine whether it is to remain a serous fluid or whether it is to\\n      become a purulent fluid.\\n      \\n The observations of Dieulafoy allow him\\n      to state that when the fluid contains five thousand (5000) or more red\\n      blood globules to the cubic millimeter, empyema will be the result. More\\n      important, and later, are the researches of Baviere, who has demonstrated\\n      the presence of the streptococcus in a certain number of cases, the\\n      pneumococcus in others, and the bacillus tuberculosis of Koch in others.\\n      In the majority of cases he found no bacilli. His conclusions, based on a\\n      large number of cases, are as follows:.\\n      \\n 1. Early aspiration.\\n      \\n 2. If the pneumococcus or bacillus of\\n      Koch is found, the puncture is to be repeated if the fluid persists or\\n      increases.\\n      \\n 3. If the streptococcus is found,\\n      resort at once to pleurotomy.\\n      \\n Briefly, as to the technique of the\\n      operation already described in our presence by Prof. Biggar:.\\n      \\n The weight of opinion is in favor of\\n      the sixth intercostal space in the middle axillary line as the point for\\n      puncture.\\n      \\n The instrument, in aspirator, with the\\n      special trocar of Potain or Frantzed to avoid wounding the lung.\\n      \\n Use absolute asepsis. Withdraw the\\n      fluid very slowly. Do not withdraw more than a quart at one operation.\\n      Stop the moment the patient complains of pain, or enough or dyspnoea\\n      appear.\\n      \\n JOHN W.D. DOWLING, M.D.: After reading\\n      Dr. Schley\\'s able argument in favor of early operation in cases of\\n      pleurisy with effusion, it is difficult to open the discussion when one is\\n      in almost complete accord with the views expressed. I have seen too much\\n      of the ill effects following delay in these cases, the delay in some cases\\n      being due to timidity and in other cases to failure to recognize the\\n      actual conditions present. The disadvantages of delay are many, and by far\\n      the most important at these, to my mind, is the fact that every day\\'s\\n      persistence of the fluid in the pleural cavity adds to the chance of that\\n      fluid becoming purulent, thus creating an empyema out of a simple serous\\n      effusion, or sero-fibrinous perhaps more frequently than simple serous.\\n      Every one admits that an empyema is a more grave condition, and it seems\\n      negligent to fail to resort to operative measures early, the result being\\n      the not unlikely development of the more serious condition, with its\\n      consequent dangers to the life of the patient.\\n      \\n As your speaker has said, many are not\\n      in favor of operation when moderate effusion remains unabsorbed. It seems\\n      clear, that if the consequences of the prolonged presence of this fluid\\n      were properly considered, the number of those who hold this opinion would\\n      be materially diminished. The presence in the pleural cavity of even a\\n      moderate amount of serous fluid necessitates the compression of part of\\n      the lung on the affected side, with a retraction of the lung as well. By\\n      this compression, air cells are obliterated entirely and portions of the\\n      lungs rendered almost impervious to the entrance of air further than the\\n      bronchi and larger bronchioles. The circulation is interfered with and\\n      slowed. From what we know of the conditions favorable to the development\\n      of tubercular processes in the lung, we see that the conditions required\\n      are thus produced, and though the effusion may eventually be absorbed, the\\n      chances are, that more serious trouble of the nature to will have had an\\n      opportunity to develop. Even failing this, the lung thus for a long time\\n      unable to expand will refuse to do so when the opportunity does come, and\\n      there will be a permanent coupling of the lung, and not uncommonly a\\n      visible deformity of the chest as well. The shorter the time the lung has\\n      been compressed the more as well. The shorter the time the lung has been\\n      compressed the more readily then will it expand if the compression be\\n      removed, and the earlier the operation is performed, even though\\n      necessarily repeated, the greater chance will there be of restoration in\\n      perfect function.\\n      \\n I would differ with Dr. Schley in his\\n      statement that the operative procedure will speedily restore our patient\\n      to perfect health. It is too sweeping a generalization. Many times early\\n      removal of the fluid will do this, but in my experience cases not\\n      infrequently arise where the removal must be repeated, not once only but\\n      several times, the disease lasting over a considerable period. I agree\\n      with the practice of early operation, but am not so sanguine as to its\\n      inevitable, favorable and speedy cure. Occasional and experience has\\n      taught me this.\\n      \\n The presence or absence of orthopnoea I\\n      do not consider a reliable indicator by itself for operation or delay. In\\n      many cases the accumulation has been so gradual that a considerable degree\\n      of toleration is attained, the patient being able to lie down without\\n      distress, and even to endure moderately gentle exercise without extreme\\n      dyspnoea. If orthopnoea be present, operate at once, but if it be absent,\\n      try to see if you cannot find other indications for operating, and if you\\n      cannot, operate, anyway, and I believe your results will give you reasons\\n      for early operation in succeeding cases.\\n      \\n As to whether the operation should be\\n      that of aspiration or free incision should be determined by the character\\n      of the fluid. If serous of even sero-fibrinous, aspiration would be\\n      indicated. But if purulent, particularly i children, the recovery of a\\n      number of cases after free incision has been performed, the immediate\\n      improvement consequent upon the complete removal of the pus, an\\n      impossibility where aspiration is resorted to, and the case with which\\n      further accumulation is prevented by the establishment of free drainage,\\n      all speak loudly in favor of this method, and in these cases it would seem\\n      to be almost certainly indicated.\\n      \\n A.A. WHIPPLE, M.D.: I want to agree in\\n      the main with all that has been said in the first paper and in the\\n      discussion. I would like to state a case that happened to me three or four\\n      years ago which I left in other care during a brief absence. When I\\n      returned I found the boy just ready to die. He was fourteen years of age.\\n      The father and three or four brothers or sisters died of consumption and\\n      some two or three of his uncles and aunts. He had hectic fever, high\\n      temperature, and all the symptoms pointing to empyema. Without any\\n      hesitation I made a free incision between the fifth and sixth ribs,\\n      removed three quarts of offensive matter, put in a drain-age-tube and\\n      syringed as thoroughly as possible, and followed that up for a few days,\\n      morning and evening. The temperature came down considerably, but the case\\n      not being satisfactory I put him under chloroform and made another\\n      incision between the eighth and ninth rib, put in another drainage-tube,\\n      and followed that with free syringing, using peroxide of hydrogen. I used\\n      it frequently, throwing it in at the upper tube and letting it run out of\\n      the lower. He made a good recovery, and in a not very long time. But the\\n      fact was it ought to have been operated earlier. It was on account of my\\n      absence from home that this was not done. In several instances I have\\n      operated early and have always found it best.\\n      \\n W.H. BURT, M.D.: It seems applicable,\\n      while on this subject, that I should show you a new instrument that I have\\n      just devised for examination of the lungs. Heretofore our instruments have\\n      been made principally of rubber, and rubber is a very poor conductor of\\n      sound. I have devised an instrument made wholly of metal, and with the use\\n      of the ball and socket joint we get every motion we want, and I am pleased\\n      to state that it carries the sound ten-fold better than any other device\\n      up to date. I simply want to exhibit it to the members of the Society at\\n      this time. The paper that has been read here I can heartily endorse.\\n      \\n E.R. EGGLESTON. M.D.: It seems, ladies\\n      and gentlemen, that I am to take up the unpopular side of this question.\\n      Is pleurisy to be treated by surgical means exclusively?.\\n      \\n That is the question I would like to\\n      have answered. So far neither in the papers nor in the discussions has a\\n      single word been said about the Homoeopathic remedy. I claim this: that\\n      under the proper use of the proper remedy administered at the proper time\\n      and place and under the proper conditions the trocar becomes obsolete. So\\n      much for that.\\n      \\n Now, I take exception to the philosophy\\n      of the paper. Let us see. An inflammation has been set up in the cavity.\\n      Nature, for the express purpose of keeping the surfaces of that cavity\\n      apart, has filled it more or less completely with fluid. These gentlemen\\n      propose to withdraw that fluid and hinder the operations of nature, let\\n      those surfaces come together and become adherent. That is why we get so\\n      many cases of fibroid phthisis in the hospitals and so few of them in\\n      private practice.\\n      \\n Do they do it in fractures? Isn\\'t the\\n      process precisely the same under different conditions? Here is a broken\\n      bone, and what does nature do? Throws out a provisional callus to protect\\n      the fractured ends of the bone. In pleurisy, nature throws out a\\n      provisional fluid to keep the surfaces apart. The cases are precisely\\n      analogous. Do they open the location of the fractured bone and take out\\n      this bony deposit? Why, no; they encourage it. What does nature do with\\n      the excess? Absorbs it, just exactly as it does in pleurisy. Nature takes\\n      care of its own deposits.\\n      \\n The only experience given us, so far as\\n      I heard, was that of the Old School. Is there any other? I have my own\\n      experience, and I have heard the experience of many others. Now what is\\n      it? That at the onset of this inflammatory action, just as in the onset of\\n      every other inflammatory action, there is irritation, hyperaemia,\\n      exudation always. Well, now what are the remedies that control all these\\n      processes? First, Aconite. Aconite controls the irritative stage on a\\n      philosophical and physiological basis. As soon as the irritative stage has\\n      passed, Bryonia controls the exudation stage on philosophical and\\n      physiological grounds, and it will do it, other things being equal, every\\n      time.\\n      \\n J. MONTFORT SCHLEY, M.D.: I think Dr.\\n      Eggleston\\'s remarks are such as no one will take exception to. he has\\n      stated his case very well, but we had nothing to do with the medical side\\n      of the case at all. I have seen, within the last sixteen months, nearly\\n      fifty cases of pleurisy with effusion. Perhaps I have been peculiarly\\n      fortunate. In most of them I was in consultation, and for the doctor\\'s\\n      special benefit I wish to emphasize his points. I am just as good a\\n      Homoeopath as he is. For his especial benefit I will say that every one of\\n      these I operated upon had been attended by the best Homoeopathic\\n      physicians in New York and vicinity. They had received Aconite, they had\\n      received Bryonia and everything else-opiates and Iodine-and that is all\\n      the good that it did them.\\n      \\n Now, there are two sides to these\\n      things and to these cases. If they had come from the Old School, I would\\n      put them in their proper place; but not one of them had been treated by an\\n      Allopathist, because I don\\'t consult with them if I can help it. Some of\\n      them were treated by men whom you have applauded on this platform-men who\\n      have come from New York, and who cannot be beaten as far as a Homoeopathic\\n      prescription is concerned.\\n      \\n I repeat, I believe in a large majority\\n      of cases that the Homoeopathic remedies have a wonderful and decided\\n      influence upon pleuritic effusions, but sometimes they seem to utterly\\n      fail. Whether it is a predisposition of the patient, whether it is a\\n      peculiar condition of the atmosphere, or whether it is the peculiar stage,\\n      of the virulent inflammation that takes place, I am unable to say.\\n      \\n When the doctor comes to talk about\\n      fibroid phthisis, I want to remind him that ours were cases that never had\\n      been operated on for fibroid phthisis. If the doctor had seen the\\n      post-mortems that I have had in the Vienna hospital, he would know that\\n      the majority had never seen a physician. With the pleura as thick as that\\n      (indicating), and the trouble entirely on one side of the lung, it seems\\n      to me that it is plain that the trouble has arisen from pleuritis, and not\\n      from a tuberculosed condition. I wrote this paper mainly not because I am\\n      afraid to go to the Old School-for we have got plenty of good Homoeopathic\\n      physicians in New York who have a great deal of experience-but it is the\\n      dread and disgust that a homoeopathic physician, and particularly a good\\n      Homoeopathic physician, has against surgery. He prescribes nothing else\\n      but Homoeopathic remedies, and he hates to have his patient put under the\\n      knife, and will fight it off until the last minute. That thing is done, in\\n      my opinion and experience, repeatedly. he thinks that his remedies will\\n      relieve these conditions; but how can they do it when you have the lungs\\n      squeezed down to the size of your fist and an enormous pleural mass there,\\n      and the pleura so thick i cannot absorb anything at all?.\\n      \\n Another thing is, follow up these\\n      cases, and see whether they develop fibroid phthisis after an early\\n      operation. I have had a good many under my care when I had the privilege\\n      of being their family physician, and have followed them for years, and you\\n      can scarcely detect a trace of adhesion of the pleura, and the scar has\\n      nearly all disappeared. In my experience, it is these very cases (whether\\n      it be a thickened pleura or a serous effusion) where we are more likely to\\n      get fibroid phthisis and curvature of the spine-the cases where nature\\n      cannot help herself nor do herself justice as the usually does.', \"Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is a hormone that comes from the adrenal gland. It is also made in the brain. DHEA leads to the production of androgens and estrogens (male and female sex hormones). DHEA levels in the body begin to decrease after age 30. Levels decrease more quickly in women. Lower DHEA levels are found in people with hormonal disorders, HIV/AIDS, Alzheimer's disease, heart disease, depression, diabetes, inflammation, immune disorders, and osteoporosis. Corticosteroids, birth control taken by mouth, and agents that treat psychiatric disorders may reduce DHEA levels.Evidence suggests that DHEA may help treat depression, obesity, and osteoporosis. However, more research is needed to support its use for hormonal disorders, sexual function, and lupus (an autoimmune disorder that affects the skin and organs). DHEA has been studied for the treatment of HIV, schizophrenia, and severe injury.DHEA may cause side effects related to other hormones. Women may experience symptoms such as oily skin, increased unnatural hair growth, a deep voice, irregular periods, smaller breast size, and increased genital size. Men may experience breast tenderness, urinary urgency, aggression, or reduced size of the testes. Other side effects that may occur in either sex include acne, sleep problems, headache, nausea, skin itching, and mood changes. DHEA may also affect levels of other hormones, insulin, and cholesterol. Safety information is lacking on the long-term effects of DHEA. DHEA may increase the risk of prostate, breast, and ovarian cancers.

What conclusions can be drawn from these\\n      observations? Simply, that mankind, as a body, is physically and mentally\\n      diseased, although a good external appearance may indicate perfect health,\\n      just as happens with fruits of good color, the interior of which is\\n      unsound.\\n      \\n In man, the two forces of conservation\\n      and destruction, health, and disease, are in ceaseless warfare, the end of\\n      which is death.

DUNN, M.D.,.\\n      \\n Secretary.', 'Lactobacillus acidophilus is a member of the Lactobacillus genus of bacteria. These bacteria can be found in the mouth, intestine, and vagina. L. acidophilus is thought to benefit health, since it produces vitamin K and lactase. However, L. acidophilus cannot make many other vitamins and amino acids. Because of this, L. acidophilus is mostly found in the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract where there are higher amounts of these nutrients.L. acidophilus is commonly used in food, such as yogurt, other dairy products, and fermented soy products, such as miso and tempeh.L. acidophilus is one of the most commonly used probiotics, microorganisms that are used to promote health. Probiotics are different from prebiotics, which are complex sugars that may support the growth of \"good\" bacteria in the intestinal tract. The word \"synbiotic\" means that a product has both a probiotic and a prebiotic.There is good evidence for the use of L. acidophilus in treating vaginal infections. However, there is unclear evidence for other medicinal uses of L. acidophilus, such as in irritable bowel syndrome, brain disorders, asthma, high cholesterol, lactose digestion, or diarrhea.Although it is thought to be safe with few side effects, L. acidophilus by mouth should be avoided in people who have intestinal damage, immune problems, or an overgrowth of bacteria in the intestines. These people may have a higher risk of having the bacteria leave the GI tract and possibly cause multiple organ failure.

The two elements\\n      of comparison implied in the above statement are the effects if drugs on\\n      the healthy body and the clinical features of disease, in either case,\\n      both the subjective elements of the disease which is appreciated by the\\n      patient as well as the objective manifestations as observed by the\\n      physician being taken into account. Medicines administered on this plan\\n      are usually single and in small doses, at least below the generally\\n      accepted pharmacologic and so-called physiologic dose. It is a method, not\\n      a doctrine or a system. It is a therapy complete in itself and independent\\n      of the allied sciences of physiology and pathology so far as these consist\\n      of changing doctrines and conceptions. It is a practical method, or\\n      organon, as its originator Hahnemann used it for effecting in the best\\n      manner a certain end, namely, the cure of disease.\\n      \\n Application of an agent which produces\\n      in a healthy individual the symptoms similar to those found in a specific\\n      disease process was recognized by Hippocrates and others.\\n      \\n Hippocrates stated that disease was\\n      cured through a method of treatment which contracts it and a method where\\n      the disease of treatment which counteracts it and a method of treatment\\n      which counteracts it and a method where the disease is removed through\\n      remedies which produce similar symptoms to the disease. We find that\\n      before Hahnemann seized this principle as a general basis, tested and\\n      worked out this thought and formulated it as a rule for medical practice,\\n      physicians were treating vomiting with an emetic, preparations of organs\\n      of animals were given for disorders of the same organ in man, application\\n      of heat to burns, acid to acidity of stomach, etc. Nowadays actually these\\n      two principles of Hippocrates for representing remedy finding have been\\n      successful. Sometimes both of these principles, although through different\\n      thought process, lead to the same remedy. For instance, in one school of\\n      thought mercury is given to oppose the action of a bacillary dysentery by\\n      destroying the cause, in the other case the drug is given because it\\n      produces a similar picture in a healthy person when given in large doses,\\n      but its deadening effect is removed when given in small doses for then it\\n      stimulates the resistance, defensive and curative powers of the organism\\n      against the disease. Parenthetically, we may insert the fact that it has\\n      been shown, for instance, in case or adrenalin, by Renty, and others, that\\n      adrenalin dilates rather than constricts in 1/1000, but in the more dilute\\n      forms it stimulates the vessels by constriction.\\n      \\n There are three recognizable kinds of\\n      actions possessed by drugs which can be referred to as mechanical,\\n      chemical and dynamic, respectively. It is in this last chemical and\\n      dynamic, respectively. It is in this last class of action of drugs that\\n      homoeopathy works its rule of similia. If we avail ourselves of the\\n      mechanical or chemical properties of substances, we do so on mechanical\\n      and chemical principles. On the other hand, the dynamic principle which is\\n      here involved depends on there being a changed physical state which gives\\n      a substance energy to reach and affect tissues. Drug energy, no drug\\n      material, is dealt with. The drug mass by its division and agitation\\n      energizes the super imposed menstrum (alcohol or sugar) which, when taken\\n      into the body, stimulates suitable tissues.\\n      \\n The next principles is important so far\\n      as psychiatry is concerned and that is the doctrine of the totality of\\n      symptoms which includes the entire reactions of the patient, both\\n      subjective and subjective The totality of symptoms, including the\\n      sufferings, feeling, reactions of the patient the general and local\\n      manifestations of the disease, constitutes the disease. General and local\\n      manifestations of the disease, constitutes the disease. General and local\\n      symptoms constitute only a small part in the total picture. This concept\\n      enables us to treat maladies in their formative state, in state of\\n      subjective experiences before the pathologic process has progressed to\\n      state of physical diagnosis. We know that early states and recognizable\\n      mainly by symptoms of subjective nature. This concept is taken into\\n      cognizance in the general medical aphorism, \"Treat the patient, not\\n      the disease.\" This holds especially true in mental disease where we\\n      get the reactions of the patient to the disease before the latter is\\n      discernible. Our chief goal is, therefore, to cover the totality of\\n      symptoms. This doctrine fits in very well with the concept of the total\\n      personality. We must restore the normal integrated pattern in all its\\n      aspects, and should not treat the diseased element along. That is what we\\n      try to do in using was referred to as hygienic measures.\\n      \\n Our therapeutics are biologically based\\n      not entirely on cause, but on organismal reactions, that is on the\\n      reactions of human beings as a whole to the situations confronted, on the\\n      physical make-up, the constitution, the functional alterations, the\\n      pathologic state, the causative factors, presence or absence of past\\n      causes both predisposing and exciting, the mental symptoms, reactions of\\n      the organism to environment, in short and complete picture of the diseased\\n      state in a particular individual. By so coordinating the relationship\\n      between the diseased state and drugs effect and by individualizing the\\n      case, the smaller is the effective dose which is necessary, so that there\\n      is no chance of doing any harm. The smallest amount of the agent that will\\n      prove effective is administered.\\n      \\n An important keynote in our prescribing\\n      is the individualization of the case. A study of the special factors that\\n      differentiate two cases of the same disease from one another as well as a\\n      study of the disease itself is important. Such a differentiation is\\n      necessary in homoeopathic prescribing. It is not sufficient to stop with\\n      the classifications of the diseased state as an entity. Not all\\n      individuals are alike in form, functional response, mental and physical\\n      make-up, psychologic reactions, etc. This has been shown by Draper and\\n      others who have studied the constitutional make up associated with\\n      diseases. We cannot expect dissimilar individuals to react in the same way\\n      to same causative agent of diseases. One individuals to react in the same\\n      way to same causative agent of diseases. One individual is sensitive to a\\n      certain drug whereas another tolerates it.\\n      \\n One can readily see how difficult it\\n      would be in mental disease with all its variegated number of mental\\n      symptoms, to uncover a \"similimum\" which would cover he\\n      \"totality of symptoms.\" Although each case has its own\\n      individuality, there are basic uniform manifestations in a single disease\\n      or drug group, which are common to the disease or group of drugs. For\\n      instance, in a case of general paralysis there are certain basis subject\\n      and objective symptoms. In the same fashion, a group of drugs give base\\n      symptoms referable to the predilected tissues. The determinative symptoms\\n      which distinguish one cases of a certain disease from another or\\n      differentiate one drug from another in a certain group, are complex in\\n      mental states. We depend, there fore, on a certain group of drugs covering\\n      certain disease states, following which we abstract from the diseased\\n      state in a particular individual as many determinative symptoms as we can\\n      and try to fit them with a drug in the particular group whose pathogenesis\\n      closely approximates the symptoms we have abstracted.\\n      \\n Another important concept is the\\n      correlation of mental disease with physical illness. This was recognized\\n      by homoeopathic therapeutists for some time and they emphasized the metal\\n      symptoms produced by the drug more than they did the physical symptoms.\\n      Nux vomica, for instance, is beneficial in hypochondriasis, melancholia,\\n      out of proportion to dyspepsia, weight being placed on the mental angle.\\n      We at Middletown feel that by concentrating on the physical angle in a\\n      patient no matter what psychosis he has, we will modify the severity of\\n      his mental reactions and in some cases evoke a cure. We therefore search\\n      diligently for all physical disturbances, both general and local, and\\n      treat any by homoeopathic and other methods.\\n      \\n The Phrase \"likes are treated with\\n      likes\" embodies as aspect of the remedial agent and an aspect of the\\n      disease. It is therefore important to know the general action of the\\n      medicinal agent, the particular tissues or functions upon which it acts.\\n      Nux vomica has an especial affinity for the sensory side of the central\\n      nervous system. Alcohol the toxin has a similar affinity; therefore in\\n      alcohol cases nux vomica is most often indicated.\\n      \\n As already implied, there is no\\n      necessity on the part of the homoeopathic prescriber to make a study of\\n      medicines in themselves prior to their application to practice. The\\n      pathognomonic effects have been ascertained and recorded. We have but to\\n      refer to such a record after we have examined our patient to discover the\\n      similimum in his case. The closer we approximate the individual to the\\n      drug giving similar pathologic effects in a similar type of healthy\\n      individual the more chance we have for cure. Hence, the arrangement of\\n      pathogenesis as will be noticed in the form of a schema of disconnected\\n      symptoms.\\n      \\n We will now give you a few of the\\n      drugs, with emphasis upon their mental manifestations, from which we\\n      deduce the type of case in which they are valuable. It is not intended to\\n      form any a priori notion of the medicine or to see in its effects any true\\n      picture of disease. It simply may be applicable in one type individual\\n      with, let us say, manic-depressive and not in another type of individual\\n      with the same disease. We will also draw in a few of our own cases as\\n      illustrations.\\n      \\n Let us commence with our manic\\n      excitements. Talcott stated that out choice commonly lay between three\\n      mydriatics: belladonna, hyoscyamus and stramonium. He advocated belladonna\\n      in those cases where there was marked hyperemia, sudden explosions of rage\\n      and fury, restlessness and destructiveness. Hyoscyamus he gave in those\\n      cases that had tendency to expose their person.\\n      \\n We have in mind a case where the\\n      patient was given a hypo of hyoscine hydrobromide and who had symptoms.\\n      \\n Butler also recommenced belladonna in\\n      intense mental excitement with treatment with great violence and\\n      destructiveness against everything within reach. We have used this remedy\\n      rather extensively in such cases as described above. More particularly\\n      when there is a flushed face, dilated pupils, rapid flow of ideas,\\n      emotional instability frequent emotional shifts from an irritable, angry\\n      state to one of euphoria and elation. This drug we can verify is certainly\\n      the most common one used in manics.\\n      \\n Hyoscyamus is frequently used at\\n      Middletown State Hospital. Here the symptoms are restlessness of pressure\\n      of ideas and activity, continuous state of elations, obscenity, eroticism\\n      and tendency to expose the body.\\n      \\n In the most intense form of excitement\\n      we have used Stramonium.\\n      \\n Our findings to the efficacy of these\\n      drugs cannot be truly evaluated, due to the introduction of other forms of\\n      control of the excitement. We will later introduce statistical data, but\\n      in view of such data we can say that out better results are due for one\\n      thing to the absence of morphine, hyoscine or any other sedative. We\\n      believe the injudicious use of morphine and hypnotics in excitements is\\n      injurious. Its supply increases the state of cerebral excitement that\\n      already exists. We flood the system with large doses which disturb the\\n      normal structures, let along the pathologic structures. It has been shown\\n      that 1/4 gr. morphine will produce acidosis lasting one to four hours; a\\n      small dose will produce alkalosis. This would add to the acidosis already\\n      existing in cases of excitement. We add fuel to the fire. As in the case\\n      of chronic brain disease, an acute organic delirium is a summation of\\n      effects. In pure acute delirium either psychogenic or organic, what\\n      results is a summation of effects. In our acute psychogenic excitement we\\n      have found that those cases that have some organic state, such as heart\\n      conditions. are more apart to have an acute organic delirium superimposed\\n      upon the functional delirium when hypnotics are administered. The\\n      following case is a good example.\\n      \\n H.McC., aged fifty-two, diagnosed mixed\\n      manic, third attack, third admission, white male; a lawyer by profession.\\n      History of many attacks of rheumatism, rejected during the war for cardiac\\n      condition. Three weeks before admission here, he spoke incessantly, was\\n      hyperactive, violent. Sedatives were given to quiet him and he came here\\n      November 9, 1934, with a mixture of psychogenic and organic features. The\\n      latter were disorientation, marked incoherence and confusion, varying\\n      levels of consciousness, speech defect, content of occupational character,\\n      preservation, all in all an engrafted acute organic delirium. In two days\\n      the entire picture subsided and was replaced by retardation, memory\\n      defects, weeps spells, sadness and difficulty in organization of his\\n      thoughts. He made the following comments the following week. \"If I\\n      take something to make me sleep, it is very bad. When I come out of the\\n      drug, there is a hazy, uncertain confusion, excitement and bad dreams.\\n      Ever since I was a kid, Ive noticed that in every illness when I took a\\n      drug to produce sleep, either during during the effect of the drug or\\n      after the drug wears off, there is a delirious state. I havent any such\\n      states since Ive been here and youll note I havent asked you what drug you\\n      were giving me although all my life either I have been told or I would\\n      naturally ask.\" He went home recovered the first of this year, having\\n      been a fine shape for over a mouth previously, Here the drug given was\\n      cactus gran. The symptoms of depression which set in following the\\n      excitement together with the sensation of weight on his brain plus\\n      frightening spells at night plus the cardiac constricting sensation,\\n      fitted this remedy.\\n      \\n It is clear that in these functional\\n      cases where there is a physical organic factor, the cerebral cortex is\\n      more sensitive to hypnotics. It is the same mechanism that we find in\\n      organic brain disease or in chronic toxic infectious processes where the\\n      brain is in state of chronic irritation and thereby reacts violently to\\n      hypnotics. The following is a good illustration of a chronic toxemia set\\n      up by endogenous and exogenous toxins culminating in an acute cerebral\\n      excitement upon administration of morphine and hyoscine. In this case the\\n      fundamental reactive pattern was a psychoneurotic one.\\n      \\n E.G., white, female, aged fifty-one,\\n      married, has three children. Had several illness in her adulthood\\n      influenza, pneumonia and appendicitis. In July 1933, she contracted\\n      rheumatic fever. She was a neurotic personality who became very impatient\\n      with the protracted course of her illness. For two months she received all\\n      sorts of treatment from any number of physicians including chiropractors.\\n      For two weeks before admission she received an ampoule of hyoscine and\\n      morphine daily, and three days before admission here july 2, 1933, she was\\n      delirious.\\n      \\n She was brought into the hospital with\\n      a typical acute organic delirium. Our summary of the case was as follows.\\n      \"We have here an intense psychoneurotic reaction caused by a disease\\n      process, the latter having been maltreated. Mixed up and superimposed on\\n      the type of reactive pattern is an acute delirium prepared by the\\n      predisposing factor, that is, endogenous toxins emanating from the\\n      arthritic focus; and excited by exogenous toxins, morphine, hyoscine and\\n      twenty other varieties of anodynes, sedatives, hypnotics and chologogues,\\n      etc. The delirium cleared up in a few days; the hysterical outbursts and\\n      drug craving were satisfied by hypos of sterile water; the rheumatic\\n      disease plus the mental signs of apprehension and fears and the hysterical\\n      outburst of shrieks of pains called for rhus tox. Patients organismal\\n      reaction improved far greater than the arthritic focus, which remained as\\n      short of a hysterical conversion symptom, but this ultimately cleared up\\n      so that she sat up out if bed within two weeks and was home in a\\n      month.\"\\n      \\n In pure functional manic depressives we\\n      make no claims whatsoever; whatever results are obtained are probably due\\n      to the psychologic factor, the satisfaction of psychic craving, suggestion\\n      and whatever mechanism it many be depending on the case.\\n      \\n A previously stated in our handling of\\n      mental cases we pay especial attention to the physical facts. We do not\\n      use homoeopathic means exclusively to combat the physical condition but we\\n      resort to any treatment which we feel will help. We give our specific\\n      drugs for their antagonistic actions if they have been proved successful.\\n      we give palliative drug such as amyl nitrite in angina pectoris, and we\\n      use other forms of therapy. In cases with a physical condition, if we can\\n      find the homoeopathic drug that will be appropriate, what usually follows\\n      is a marked improvement in the mental status. We may have to combine the\\n      remedy with other measures as we did in the following two cases In those\\n      two cases, we have organ pathology which could not be definitely\\n      associated with he attack. They are both manic depressives, manic type,\\n      with Graves disease.\\n      \\n M.S., fifty-three years of age, school\\n      teacher, white, female, had three attacks of manic-depressive psychosis.\\n      On July 18, 1933, a thyroidectomy was performed. Within twelve days she\\n      became manic. On admission here a diagnosis of manic depressive psychosis,\\n      manic type, was offered. She had mitral disease, hypertension, showed\\n      signs of hyperthyroidism, dehydration and exhaustion. In two months she\\n      was sent home recovered.\\n      \\n R.D., aged fifty-seven, female,\\n      meningitis at age of two. In 1930, attempted suicide but was unsuccessful\\n      Two years later a thyroidectomy, and eight months following she was\\n      destructive, agitated, had delusions of death and at one time during this\\n      period she attempted suicide by drinking iodine. Admitted here September\\n      23, 1931. Diagnosis of manic-depressive, manic type, offered. Her\\n      condition was desperate. She had a poor heart, rapid pulse, exophthalmus,\\n      eye signs, tremors, low diastolic, moist skin, increased metabolic rate,\\n      hypertrophied heart; in addition she suffered from acidosis and developed\\n      carbuncle. Improvement was slow for a time, and then rapid progress;\\n      finally discharged April 6, 1932, residence in hospital being five charged\\n      April 6, 1932, resistance in hospital being five and one-half months. In\\n      both cases we have iodine in homoeopathic doses together, of course, with\\n      cardiac supportive treatment, anti-acidotic treatment, clysis, glucose\\n      injections, hydrotherapy, etc. with good results . At least the two cases\\n      survived.\\n      \\n We cannot go into the many physical\\n      symptoms arising from tissue pathology other than in the central nervous\\n      system which are found in our psychotics. Suffice it to say that we\\n      attempt in many such cases to find a drug that fits.\\n      \\n In depressed states drugs most commonly\\n      used at Middletown are ignatia, arsenicum album, phosphoric acid, cactus\\n      gran and baptisia.\\n      \\n Ignatia is probably more often\\n      prescribed than any other prescriptions. Butler, Talcott, Boyal and others\\n      referred to arsenicum album as most often indicated, the features of this\\n      drug being pale face, pinched appearance, emaciation, pallor, ceaseless\\n      restlessness, marked agitated depression, mental anguish to point of\\n      frenzy, moaning and groaning, self- destruction. Ignatia fits the silent,\\n      brooding, seclusive, depressed cases. They are usually quiet, timid,\\n      fearful, irresolute, and suffer from insomnia and impotence with sex\\n      desires.\\n      \\n Phosphoric acid is given in those cases\\n      with anxiety, sadness, grief over a love affair, inclined to weep,\\n      physical exhaustion resulting from masturbation.\\n      \\n Baptisia is given in typhoidal-like\\n      states.\\n      \\n The following case illustrates the good\\n      effect of ignatia in depressions.\\n      \\n R.W., aged sixty-one, white, male;\\n      occupation that of practical nurse. A quiet, pleasant personality who\\n      suffered several depressions earlier in life which did not necessitate\\n      hospitalization. In the beginning in 1932 he suffered a severe depression\\n      which persisted for six months, made voluntary application here August 15,\\n      1932, and was accepted. Diagnosed depressed type of manic depressive. His\\n      mental symptoms called for ignatia. He stated that the drug helped him a\\n      great deal. It had relieved him of his nervous, jumpy feelings and of his\\n      insomnia. He went home recovered June 30, 1933. For a time he was in good\\n      shape. On December 14, 1934, he came back to the hospital with same\\n      complaints. The depression came on six weeks previously. He requested the\\n      same drug which he stated had helped him previously. This was done with an\\n      improvement of his symptoms. In this case we cant tell whether the\\n      security and relief be obtained from the institution was projected onto\\n      the drug or whether the drug resulted in his improvement. The drug could\\n      have well been a rationalization of the sense of relief he obtained from\\n      institutional protection.\\n      \\n The next case of depression is a rather\\n      interesting mixture of psychogenic and organic factors, this case being\\n      helped by calcarea carb. and iodine. M.P., white, female, aged fifty-one,\\n      married, one child, had attack of manic excitement in 1916 which lasted\\n      three months. Last year, in worrying over her husbands financial troubles,\\n      she became obsessed with the idea that she had concentrated a disease and\\n      was infecting others. Had many ideas of bodily changes. Feared her body\\n      was rotting away. She spoke of death. AT night was seized with nightmares\\n      during which impulses to kill he son who she feared was going to be\\n      kidnapped, overwhelmed he. Calcarea carb. was prescribed Physically, a\\n      goitre and signs of hyperthyroidism were found. In this case there was an\\n      unconscious rejection of her body, and on this account arose guilt\\n      feelings, in the form of self-accusatory ideas and considerable anxiety.\\n      Mixed in this picture was also a sense of reality and misinterpretation of\\n      environment which we attributed to the organic state produced by\\n      hyperthyroidism. This was combated with small doses of iodine. Patient in\\n      two weeks and rid herself of all her abnormal ideas and was normal in all\\n      respects. Within a month she was home.\\n      \\n In the psychoneurosis we have at our\\n      disposal a large number of remedies depending on the character of the\\n      obsessions and fears and where the somatic pathology is fixed. What we do\\n      here, as in other of our so-called functional cases, is to divorce or\\n      abstract from the totality of individual reaction those mental symptoms\\n      and other characteristics of the patient and dry to approximate it to a\\n      drug giving similar symptoms. It would appear that the tissue alteration\\n      and general defense reaction which characterizes the drug would be\\n      nullified because of the apparent nonexistence of tissue pathology. This\\n      fallacy can be explained only under the presumption that we postulate the\\n      existence of such pathology, in a form that can be only subjectively\\n      received but not objectively recognized. At present we have followed the\\n      policy of the mental aspect of the patient. If he has somatic complaints\\n      we try to correlate still further by finding a drug giving similar somatic\\n      symptoms.\\n      \\n For example, we given nux vomica for\\n      hypochondriasis, persons who are irritable, sensitive to external stimuli,\\n      noises odors, and lights, and if they complain of gastric symptoms, sour\\n      stomach, etc., the remedy becomes more fitting. It is also given for\\n      alcohols who have similar mental symptoms and who we know have sour\\n      stomach, etc. It is obvious that in the latter cases the drug should be\\n      and is more of value. The results we obtain in the psychoneurosis are\\n      purely due to the suggestion or psychological effect of the drug. It has\\n      an advantage over the placebo in that we possibly may hit a remedy whose\\n      total symptomatology may conform to the totality of the organismal\\n      reaction. An other point is that in the placebo prescription the patient\\n      frequently becomes aware of it, becomes disturbed over the trickery and\\n      loses confidence in the physician, whereas, in our prescription they\\n      actually taste the medicine.\\n      \\n Some of the drugs commonly prescribed\\n      are aconite in combating numerous phobias; anacardium in neurosis produced\\n      by excessive mental stain with symptoms of anxiety, despair, fear of\\n      future, forgetfulness , inability to concentrate, nervous indigestion.\\n      Calcarea carb. for those who are apprehensive; fear of death, of\\n      misfortune, of losing their mind., of contracting a disease;\\n      nightmares,the obsessive type. For neurasthenia- ignatia, phosphorous;\\n      Kali phos. and strychnine phos. are more often prescribed.

In\\n      the main we have dealt with generalities, chiefly because of the\\n      realization of the gigantic problem one would have to face in getting down\\n      to absolute values and correlations.\\n      \\n Our conclusions are as follows:.\\n      \\n (1) The homoeopathic method operates\\n      without injury to the organism. It is gentle, does not involve large does,\\n      and tends to cover the disease in its totality.\\n      \\n (2) homoeopathic prescribing is a\\n      valuable adjunct in treating of mental reactions.\\n      \\n (3) The presence of physical disease is\\n      diligently searched in order to get a complete picture of the morbid state\\n      to be constructed. Physical ailments and troubles arising in or associated\\n      with our psychotics are immediately combated by homoeopathic and other\\n      efficacious means with favorable results. This is turn improves mental\\n      status of the patient.\\n      \\n (4) Psychoneurotics usually respond\\n      well, due to the psychologic effect and perhaps, in isolated cases, as\\n      result of the actual correlation of drug to the individual and his\\n      reactions.\\n      \\n (5) Homoeopathy is beneficial in cases\\n      with acute or chronic excitatory processes if the brain, either organic or\\n      psychogenic, either as result of its \" innocuous\" effect in that\\n      it removes the spectre of indiscriminate and injudicious use of sedatives\\n      and hypnotics or in some cases there is a positive effect in combating the\\n      process by stimulating the defense mechanism of the body, the production\\n      of antigens,. In such cases the drug may be similar to the drug used by\\n      other therapeutic approaches except in the matter of dosage.\\n      \\n (6) There may be cases of the\\n      functional psychosis that may respond perhaps because it satisfied some\\n      physical ailment, such as hyperthyroidism which accompanies the mental\\n      state as an associated factor.\\n      \\n (7) Chronic deteriorating conditions,\\n      either psychogenic or organic, have revealed no results.\\n      \\n PSYCHONEUROSIS ADMISSIONS FROM JULY 1,\\n      1931, TO JUNE 30, 1932\\n      \\n Ist Admission Readmission Total\\n      \\n Duration of Disease\\n      \\n Number Percent Number Percent Number\\n      Percent\\n      \\n Under 1 yr 9 50 3 16 12 67\\n      \\n Less than 1 mo 1 5+ 1 5+\\n      \\n 1-2 mos 3 16 1 5+ 4 22+\\n      \\n 2-3 mos 2 102 1 5+ 3 16\\n      \\n 3-44 mos 1 5+ 1 5+\\n      \\n 4-55 mos 1 1 5+ 1 5+\\n      \\n 4-5 mos 2 102 2 102\\n      \\n 6-12 mos 1 5+ 1 52\\n      \\n 1-2 yrs 2 102 2 102\\n      \\n 2-3 yrs 1 5+ 1 52\\n      \\n Here 3 16 1 5+ 4 22+ .', 'Vitamin E is a fat-soluble vitamin with antioxidant properties. Vitamin E exists in eight different forms: alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-tocopherol; and alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-tocotrienol. Alpha-tocopherol is the most active form in humans.Dosing for vitamin E is often given in alpha-tocopherol equivalents (ATEs). This accounts for the different activities that the different forms of vitamin E have in the body. One milligram of an ATE is equal to 1.5 international units (IU).Vitamin E supplements are available in natural or man-made forms. The natural forms are usually labeled with the letter \"d\" (for example, d-gamma-tocopherol), whereas synthetic forms are labeled \"dl\" (for example, dl-alpha-tocopherol).Foods that contain vitamin E include eggs, fortified cereals, fruit, green leafy vegetables (such as spinach), meat, nuts, nut oils, poultry, vegetable oils (corn, cottonseed, safflower, soybean, sunflower), argan oil, olive oil, wheat germ oil, and whole grains. Cooking and storage may destroy some of the vitamin E in foods.Vitamin E has been studied for the prevention or treatment of many health conditions. However, there is a lack of strong evidence to support its use for any disease at this time, aside from vitamin E deficiency.Concerns have been raised about the safety of vitamin E supplementation, particularly in high doses. An increased risk of bleeding may occur in people taking blood thinners, or those with vitamin K deficiency. Evidence suggests that regular use of high-dose vitamin E supplements may increase the risk of death from all causes by a small amount, although research is unclear. Caution is advised.Vitamin E has also been studied for scar prevention. However, there is a lack of evidence to support this use. Because of a risk of allergic skin symptoms, some researchers have advised against the use of this therapy.', 'Tresorie - Editorial THE PROBLEM OF SMALL - POX VACCINATION [Editorial -\\nProblem Of Small Pox Vaccination]\\n\\n 1. The whole problem of prophylaxis in\\n      uncertain and complicated. No system of medicine has yet gathered\\n      knowledge enough to speak on the subject with dogmatism and authority.\\n      Statistical records provided by the so - called modern scientific medicine\\n      on the subject betray many fallacies, loop - holes and irrationalities\\n      when they are reviewed with a critical eye and an unbiased scientific\\n      mental attitude. It is very difficult - nay, almost impossible - to apply\\n      the most recent and advanced methods of statistical analysis in matters\\n      biological; and medicine is certainly a department of human biology. In\\n      this connection we request our readers to go through two memorable books\\n      of G.B. Shaw, viz., Doctors Dilemma and Doctors Delusions. On perusal of\\n      those writings it will be easily evident that the claim of reducing the\\n      mortality and preventing incidence of Small - pox infection, solely by the\\n      introduction and use of cow - lymph, is wholly unwarranted and certainly\\n      debatable.\\n      \\n 2. With the advance of human knowledge\\n      regarding public health, sanitation and standard of living the incidence\\n      of many other infectious diseases (besides small - pox) in epidemic form\\n      and mortality rate due to those diseases have progressively decreased.\\n      Evidences are not wanting that no country has ever been depopulated with\\n      small - pox before Jenners discovery or that serious epidemics of small -\\n      pox have occurred in place inspite of mass vaccination being resorted to.\\n      So the prophylactic claim of cow - lymph vaccination is still an open\\n      question.\\n      \\n 3. It is admitted on all hands that bad\\n      and sometimes dangerous or fatal after effects do occur after inoculating\\n      healthy persons or children with Vaccine for prevention and protection\\n      from small pox.\\n      \\n 4. Since 1948 State Law for compulsory\\n      vaccination against small - pox has been repealed in the United Kingdom of\\n      British Isles - but records do not prove either that the incidence of\\n      small - pox epidemic has increased in severity or that the mortality -\\n      rate due to small - pox has gone up there.\\n      \\n 5. Homoeopathy is not opposed to\\n      vaccination on principle. But it is opposed to the method of using\\n      Vaccination as being a violation of sound, natural principles of\\n      medication and potentially productive of serious injury to the living\\n      organism. It has been proved experimentally and clinically that such\\n      methods as taken recourse to by the \"allopaths\", are unnecessary\\n      and that the results claimed by their advocates can be attained more\\n      safely, more rapidly and more thoroughly by the administration of\\n      homoeopathically indicated medicines in sub - physiological doses through\\n      natural channels of the body than by introducing it forcibly by means of\\n      hypodermic needle or otherwise.\\n      \\n 6. Though the dominant method of using\\n      vaccination is likely to be attended with bad sequelae, either immediate\\n      or remote it cannot be asserted or justified that every case of\\n      vaccination will be followed by undesirable after - effects. It depends on\\n      individualisation of cases; and we have to carry on further investigations\\n      on the point. So we so neither advocate for indiscriminate mass\\n      vaccination nor stand for wholesale condemnation of vaccination. The\\n      present limitation of our knowledge regarding this problem forbids us to\\n      be dogmatic.\\n      \\n 7. Dr. Burnett and many others have\\n      shown that the ill - effects of vaccination are very similar to the\\n      symptoms of sycosis. This is our individualising factor. A sycotic patient\\n      has the potentiality of manifesting undesirable symptoms following\\n      vaccination. The symptoms of sycosis are known and we might therefore be\\n      careful to study the constitution of persons, both young and adult, to\\n      avoid disaster.\\n      \\n 8. Many distinguished Homoeopaths have\\n      claimed prophylactic properties of various remedies prepared in a\\n      homoeopathic way. But all of these have stopped short of just naming the\\n      remedies. Nobody has left definite instructions about the potencies and\\n      frequencies in which a particular drug has to be used or about any certain\\n      method of testing the development of immunity acquired by administration\\n      of such homoeopathic remedies. Here the homoeopathic doctors differ and\\n      from a practical point of view one is at a loss as to what to do. This is\\n      one great handicap from the prophylactic point of view. Very often\\n      homoeopaths and person undergoing homoeopathic prophylaxis might live\\n      under a false sense of security in time of epidemics!\\n      \\n 9. To state a few instructions, so far\\n      gathered from the current homoeopathic literature:\\n      \\n (a) Dr. Schmidt referred to a French\\n      Homoeopath who experimentally demonstrated that higher he went up in\\n      potency the longer the immunity as proved by the Shick test. He further\\n      said that the 9,000th potency would give an immunity of about eight years.\\n      The 1,000th potency would give approximately only 22 years protection and\\n      a lower one, a 30th, would give protection only for a few months.\\n      \\n (b) Dr. Grimmer is of opinion that the\\n      10M is a protective potency and the reaction is good at least for that\\n      epidemic; and if there comes another epidemic and the people want further\\n      protection, he repeats the process only for the epidemic.\\n      \\n (c) Dr. Tyler of England advocated the\\n      administration of remedies is successively higher potencies, viz., 1M, 10M\\n      and CM at an interval of 12 hours.\\n      \\n (d) The writer of this article can\\n      testify that he observed symptoms of feverishness, malaise and pain in the\\n      back and extremities in himself and his son and daughter after\\n      administration of Variolinum 10M twelve hours after the use of Variolinum\\n      1M. during an epidemic of small-pox in Calcutta.\\n      \\n 10. Our considered opinion is that use\\n      of potentized homoeopathic remedies for prophylactic purposes is enough in\\n      cases where small - pox has broken out in an epidemic form and it is not\\n      desirable to use prophylactic medicines either in a homoeopathic or\\n      allopathic way, as a routine measure whether there is an epidemic or not.\\n      But when the epidemic has broken out in a severe form or when contact with\\n      a small - pox patient is unavoidable our advice is to take homoeopathic\\n      medicine at first and to be doubly sure to take vaccination afterwards.\\n      Thus we feel bound to compromise ourselves because of our limitation in\\n      knowledge and want of having a method to test immunity after the\\n      administration of homoeopathic prophylactic remedies. Human life is too\\n      precious to make it a prey to our so - called scientific dogmatisms. We\\n      admit from our experience that crude form of vaccination goes a great way\\n      to lessen the virulence of infection in an already infected person or to\\n      avoid dangerous complications of this fell disease viz., Corneal ulcer,\\n      opacity and blindness etc. So under these circumstances of severe epidemic\\n      outbreaks of small - pox we advise or support vaccination for those who\\n      had no primary vaccination; and advise the trial of homoeo - prophylaxis\\n      first to those who had received primary vaccination to be followed by\\n      crude vaccination in order not to take any chance for receiving protection\\n      with the means known to us and at our disposal. Saving of life should be\\n      of prior importance to that of the possibility of any bad after effect\\n      following vaccination.\\n      \\n 11. Some advocate for the discovery of\\n      a homoeopathic remedy suited to the \"genus epidemicus\" affecting\\n      a locality. But there is one practical drawback in such a procedure. We\\n      have to wait till the epidemic actually sets in and a number of lives are\\n      sacrificed in the first flood - tide of an epidemic outbreak. And it is a\\n      known fact that mortality rate is highest in the first phase of any\\n      Epidemic.\\n      \\n Some advocate for studying individual\\n      constitution and selection and administration of suitably indicated\\n      homoeopathic remedies for each case before the expected outbreak of an\\n      Epidemic. But it is not at all practicable to take recourse to such a\\n      procedure in a modern city of millions of population.\\n      \\n 12. There are two ways in which\\n      Homoeopathy can assist in any Epidemic:\\n      \\n Though administration of drugs\\n      homoeopathically is not possible till symptoms manifest themselves and\\n      disease is established, it has been found however that practically certain\\n      Homoeopathic remedies do also exert a prophylactic action. Certain\\n      symptoms are anticipated, as it were, and assumed to take a certain\\n      course, then a remedy which pictures this syndrome can be given with every\\n      chance of benefit e.g., prophylactic administration of Belladonna in\\n      Sydenhams smooth Scarlatina (vide pp 115, foot - note 17, Organon 6th\\n      Edition.). Homoeopaths make use of a great deal of inadvertent preventive\\n      medicine in their daily round of practice due to the abortive effects of\\n      the clearly prescribed remedy.\\n      \\n (a) So, one way is by administering an\\n      immunising agent by way of the mouth, potentized like other homoeopathic\\n      remedies, and selected for its similarity with the particular form of the\\n      epidemic.\\n      \\n (b) Second way by elevating the patient\\n      to that higher level of health which bestowes the utmost general immunity\\n      and the greatest power of recuperation. This is accomplished as a matter\\n      of course through chronic treatment. The action of this constitutional\\n      remedy (not by any means the same for everybody) is to cure morbid\\n      tendencies, to build resistive powers, to bestow power of recovery, and\\n      thus to promote the highest general immunity.\\n      \\n The best public health is the sum total\\n      of individual healths. Health is not merely a state of being. It is power.\\n      Health is power to resist, power to recover, power to adapt life to\\n      conditions without fear, the power to liver a full life in the world. The\\n      aim of Homoeopathy is to build that power.\\n      \\n The constitutional remedy is the best\\n      protection not only against small - pox; therefore, it is the higher level\\n      of health to which Homoeopathy can lift its patients. \"The right\\n      constitutional remedy is worth as an immuniser than all the specific\\n      Decoctions that could be packed in a ship.\"\\n      \\n It is not vaccination at all but can be\\n      called the ideal and internal vaccination.\\n      \\n So long Homoeopathy has never been\\n      given a chance to be used for public health purposes by any Government of\\n      any country. It would have immunised people against all sorts of epidemic\\n      diseases and would have avoided all the ill - effects, immediate and\\n      remote, from crude processes of vaccination and inoculation as they are\\n      practised now.', 'Echinacea species belong to the aster family (Asteraceae) that originated in eastern North America. Of the nine identified species, only three are used as medicine. The roots and herbs of the species have been studied for potential immune benefits.Echinacea has been taken by mouth in Europe and the United States to help prevent or treat the common cold. In the United States, echinacea sales are thought to make up 10 percent of the dietary supplement market. Although much research has been done on the potential cold-fighting effects of echinacea, results are conflicting. There have been reports of a lack of benefit and rash caused by echinacea in children.Early studies looking at the potential benefits of echinacea for herpes and radiation poisoning have found a lack of evidence. Applying echinacea juice to the skin has been suggested for wound healing, and taking echinacea by mouth or injecting it has been suggested for vaginal yeast infections. However, clear evidence is lacking in these areas.Echinacea use has been discouraged in people who have autoimmune disease. However, more research is needed before further conclusions can be made.', 'Tresorie - OPHTHALMIC THERAPEUTICS [Ophthalmic Therapeutics]\\n\\n IT is quite unnecessary, as it would be\\n      inappropriate, for me to present to this audience, composed as it is of\\n      representative Homoeopathic physicians gathered from all parts of the\\n      civilized world, any arguments to prove the superiority of Homoeopathic\\n      therapeutics over all other methods of healing. On the other hand, in this\\n      Columbian year, when all religious, educational, and scientific bodies are\\n      holding congresses, it is fitting that we should show to the world what\\n      Homoeopathy has accomplished, and what it has to offer in contrast to\\n      Old-School teaching and practice.\\n      \\n It has devolved upon me to prepare to\\n      review of Homoeopathic therapeutics in our special department, that of\\n      ophthalmology.

If Homoeopathy is, as the illustrious Dunham expressed it, the\\n      \"Science of Therapeutics,\" then the Homoeopathic specialist\\n      should be more scientific in the choice and application of curative agents\\n      than one who relies simply upon traditional, or physiological and\\n      empirical uses of drugs; and he should be correspondingly more successful.\\n      Does experience demonstrate this to be true? Our first duty is to our\\n      patients; our first motive is to cure them as speedily and as surely as\\n      possible. We should \"prove all things, and hold fast that which is\\n      good.\" We want the best. Is Homoeopathy the best? If not, let us\\n      known it.

If we mean only the\\n      application of those drugs for the cure of morbid conditions which have\\n      actually caused similar functional disturbances and pathological lesions,\\n      them our resources are very much restricted; although in this limited\\n      interpretation of the subject, we have a number of valuable remedies.\\n      There are several reasons why our armamentarium is so much curtailed in\\n      this particular. In the first place, the records of poisoning furnish us\\n      with but few specific effects upon the eye, and our provings leave not, in\\n      many cases, been pushed to the extent of producing actual tissue changes.\\n      But the most important reason is the lack of skilled and accurate\\n      observation, which is apparent in the pathogenesis of drugs. Most recorded\\n      eye-symptoms are subjective, and frequently unreliable, because not\\n      rightly interpreted. Had every prover been subjected to a careful\\n      examination by a competent and experienced oculist, before and after a\\n      proving, and the condition of refraction, ophthalmoscopic appearance of\\n      fundus, etc, been accurately recorded, the provings would have been\\n      infinitely more valuable to the specialist. The proving of Duboisin by Dr.\\n      Deady, published in the Trans. of Am. Hom. O. and O. Society, 1880, is a\\n      model worthy of imitation, although we cannot help wishing that the eyes\\n      of the provers had been previously examined, and conditions noted.\\n      Eye-diseases are rarely purely local, especially those serious affections\\n      which endanger vision; but are usually the result of some systemic\\n      disorder, and require constitutional treatment. Similarly drugs do not\\n      affect the eye alone, but produce, in connection with eye- symptoms,\\n      indications of disturbance of remote organs and general constitutional\\n      effects. If, then, certain morbid conditions of the eye disappear under\\n      the exhibition of a remedy prescribed in strict conformity with the law of\\n      \"Similia,\" for general constitutional symptoms or for affections\\n      of other organs, is it not fair and logical to accept these eye-symptoms\\n      as reliable indications for that remedy in another similar case, even if\\n      the constitutional symptoms of the first case are lacking? is it not also\\n      probable that such a remedy, if fully proved in suitable doses, would\\n      cause the symptoms which it cures; and is not a verified symptomatology,\\n      acquired in the way suggested, a logical basis of Homoeopathic\\n      therapeutics?\\n      \\n With this understanding of our topic,\\n      and I think it is a reasonable one, we have an extensive armamentarium of\\n      specific- remedies. Allen and Norton\\'s Ophthalmic Therapeutics was\\n      compiled in this way from verified and trustworthy symptoms, and we owe an\\n      immense debt of gratitude to the authors and to the other faithful and\\n      skilful surgeons of the New York Ophthalmic Hospital, to whose labors we\\n      are largely indebted for the development of the resources of our school in\\n      this special department. In the possession of these specific remedies the\\n      Homoeopathic oculist has a great advantage over one of the Old School; but\\n      a thorough knowledge of drug effects upon the whale system, is a requisite\\n      for successful prescribing, as well as a familiarity with general\\n      diseases. We cannot successfully prescribe for eye-symptoms alone, nor can\\n      we ignore the relationship between ocular affections and diseases of other\\n      organs or the frequent dependence of eye-diseases upon constitutional\\n      dyscrasiae. For this reason an extended experience in general practice is\\n      very desirable before undertaking special work. The Homoeopathic oculist,\\n      with these added means of cure at his command,-I say \"added,\"\\n      for of course all resources of the healing art, from whatever source, are\\n      his to choose or to refuse,-can achieve results impossible without them.\\n      When all mechanical, local, and surgical measures are powerless, the\\n      suitable Homoeopathic remedy will often preserve or restore sight and cure\\n      disease, when Old-School medicine is confessedly of no avail. Many an\\n      operation can be obviated, and many an unfortunate sequence of operation\\n      can be obviated, and many an unfortunate sequence of operation be averted.\\n      Pain, in the large majority of cases, can be controlled without the use of\\n      narcotics, with their attendant unpleasant and sometimes dangerous\\n      effects, and the course of many diseases be materially shortened.\\n      \\n I promised to give you facts rather\\n      than theories, and in order to prove the truth of my assertions, let us\\n      critically examine and compare the therapeutic measures of the two schools\\n      in various affections. First, What does Old-School medicine offer for the\\n      relief and cure of eye diseases?.\\n      \\n In order to answer this question\\n      intelligently, I have carefully read and reviewed a recent text-book by a\\n      recognized authority-Noyes\\'s Diseases of the Eye-and noted every remedy\\n      recommended, with the indication for its employment. I have, of course,\\n      not noted local or surgical treatment, or the correction of refractive or\\n      muscular errors. The purely therapeutic resources, as therein outlined,\\n      comprise forty-three remedies, almost all of which are prescribed upon the\\n      most general principles, and where specific indications are given, they\\n      are most meagre in contrast with our methods of careful individualization.\\n      To particularize: \"appropriate\" general or constitutional\\n      treatment, such as alternatives, derivatives, stimulants, etc., are\\n      sometimes advised without explicit mention, and in other cases Cod-liver\\n      oil, Iron Quinine, Arsenic, Malt and Hypophosphites, especially in anaemic\\n      debility, scrofulosis, etc.\\n      \\n The following table shoes a list of\\n      other medicines mentioned, and the diseases for which they are\\n      recommended.\\n      \\n Diuretics and Purgatives, especially\\n      Rhubarb and Sada, Sal sada, Rochelle salts.-Phlyctenular keratitis,\\n      scleritis rheumatica, iritis, cataract, retinitis (apoplectica and\\n      albuminurica), amotio-retinae, neuritis, neuro-retinitis.\\n      \\n Salicylate of Sada, Lithates, Liquor\\n      potash and other alkalies-Rheumatic and gouty affections generally,\\n      particularly in iritis, neuritis, neuro-retinitis, periostitis,\\n      tendonitis, acute phlegmonous eczema of the lids, staphyloma of the\\n      sclera.\\n      \\n Antifebrine, Antipyrine, Sulphonal,\\n      Morphia, Opium, Bromides, Chloral and Phenacetine.-To relieve pain.\\n      \\n Iodide of potash. -Spasm of\\n      orbicularis, episcleritis, iritis, to arrest development of cataract, to\\n      clear opacities of the vitreous, choroiditis, retinitis, atrophy of the\\n      optic nerve, periostitis orbitae, tendonitis, generally in syphilitic and\\n      rheumatic affections.\\n      \\n Mercury.-Syphilitic affections,\\n      diphtheritic conjunctivitis, interstitial keratitis, iritis, opacities of\\n      vitreous, sympathetic ophthalmia, choroiditis, acute and chronic,\\n      retinitis albuminurica. neuritis, neuroretinitis, atrophy of the optic\\n      nerve.\\n      \\n Arsenic, Zinc, Argentum nitricum,\\n      Phosphorus.-Various affections of the nerve and retina.\\n      \\n Strychnia.-Neuro-paralytic ophthalmia,\\n      cataract, retinitis pigmentosa, amblyopia, amaurosis (genuine and\\n      hysterical), exophthalmic goitre.\\n      \\n Digitalis, Phosphoric acid, Ergot,\\n      Atropia, Strophanthus, Tonics and Sedatives.-Exophthalmic goitre.\\n      \\n Digitalis.-Diseases characterized by\\n      feeble circulation and weak heart, such as ischaemia retinae, retinitis\\n      albuminurica, with vascular degeneration (also calling for Carbonate of\\n      ammonia), amblyopia, amaurosis.\\n      \\n Muriate of pilocarpine, Infusion of\\n      jaborandi.-Amotio- retinae, staphyloma of sclera (in gouty patients),\\n      iritis, sympathetic ophthalmia, acute choroiditis, neuritis, neuro-\\n      retinitis.\\n      \\n Quinine.-To check threatened\\n      inflammation after cataract operations, cellulitis, iritis.\\n      \\n Aconite, Gelsemium,\\n      Conium.-Blepharospasm.\\n      \\n Bromo coffein.-Hysterical amblyopia.\\n      \\n Nitro-glycerine in 1/100 gr.\\n      doses.-Retinitis apoplectica with high arterial tension.\\n      \\n Mineral acids.-Cellulitis orbitae.\\n      \\n Turpentine, Colchicum. -Iritis.\\n      \\n Phosphoric acids, Phosphates.-Cataract.\\n      \\n I believe this to be a fair and\\n      impartial resume of ophthalmic therapeutics from the Old School point of\\n      view. It is not difficult to recognize the unconscious Homoeopathicity of\\n      many of their more specific applications; at least, we use the same drugs\\n      in attenuated doses, with success, in the same disease, only studying the\\n      particular and minute indications for them according to the law of\\n      \"similia.\" The essential difference between their therapeutics\\n      and ours is noticed here as in all departments of medicine, viz., they\\n      prescribe for diseases while we prescribe for the individual. Which is the\\n      more scientific?.\\n      \\n In contrast with this array, I will\\n      simply call attention to the detailed and specific symptomatology of the\\n      one hundred and forty remedies mentioned in the latest and best\\n      Homoeopathic treatise, that of Dr. Norton, already mentioned. While this\\n      list does not comprise all the resources of our school-for almost every\\n      remedy in the Materia Medica may be found curative of eye diseases under\\n      appropriate conditions-I offer it as a fair exponent of Homoeopathic\\n      treatment in contrast with the resume of Old-School therapeutics just\\n      given. It is not a compilation of theoretical and empirical indications,\\n      but is made up of thoroughly trustworthy and, for the most part, verified\\n      indications. Experience has demonstrated them to be reliable guides for\\n      the choice of the remedy. But it may be argued that this is mere\\n      assumption on my part. It certainly would be presumptuous to expect any\\n      one to accept such an assertion without satisfactory evidence, and while I\\n      cannot demonstrate to the sceptic here and now the truth of my statement\\n      by adducing overwhelming evidence in proof of the value of remedies\\n      prescribed upon such a basis, yet I can affirm what the Homoeopathic\\n      treatment of eye diseases has accomplished, what it is accomplishing every\\n      day in hospital and private practice, and what can be demonstrated to the\\n      satisfaction of any fair-minded investigator who cares to give the matter\\n      sufficient time and thought.\\n      \\n What, then, are some of the verities of\\n      Homoeopathic ocular therapeutics?.\\n      \\n I. -The action of constitutional\\n      remedies, such as Ars., Graph., Calc., Sulph., Nut.mur, and Sil. in\\n      hereditary or acquired conditions of malnutrition and in the various\\n      dyscrasiae.\\n      \\n II. -The action of Acon., Bell., Apis.,\\n      Verat. vir. and Rhus in controlling inflammatory conditions, erysipelas,\\n      cellulitis, etc.\\n      \\n III. -The action of Hepar, Sil. and\\n      Rhus in suppuration, of Gels. in serous, and absorbing haemorrhages.\\n      \\n IV. -The action of Arnica, Crotalus,\\n      Ham., Lach., and Ledum in arresting and absorbing haemorrhages.\\n      \\n V. -The action of Sil., Calc., Aurum.,\\n      Kali iodide, etc., in diseases of bone and orbit, morbid growths,\\n      periostitis, etc.\\n      \\n VI. -The action of Amyl nit., Ferrum.,\\n      Lycopus, Spongia, Nat.mur, and Ars. in exophthalmic goitre.\\n      \\n VII. -The action of Puls., Apis.,\\n      Alum., Merc., Ars., Euphrasia, Argent. nit., Rhus., etc., in catarrhal\\n      conjunctivitis, ophthalmia neonatorum, specific blenorrhoea, etc.,\\n      arresting inflammation, moderating discharge, preventing corneal\\n      complications and averting many cases of blindness.\\n      \\n VIII. -The action of Aurum., the\\n      Iodides, Baryta, the Kalis, Sil., Graph., Hepar., and Merc., on corneal\\n      tissue, healing ulcers, resolving infiltrations, clearing nebulae, and\\n      thus often avoiding minor operations, such as scraping of ulcers and\\n      phlyctenules, the use of caustics and the galvanic cautery, and of\\n      paracentesis.\\n      \\n IX. -The influence of Merc., Bry.,\\n      Cedron, Rhus, Clem., Col., Spigelia and Potash in iritis, shortening very\\n      much its course under Old-School methods, averting sequelae and rendering\\n      narcotics unnecessary.\\n      \\n X. -The undoubted influence of Caust.,\\n      Sulph., Sepia, Phos., Sil. and Iodoform in arresting and delaying the\\n      development of cataract, and even clearing opacities of cortex.\\n      \\n XI. -The influence of Bell., Bry.,\\n      Gels., Aurum., Phos., Merc., Kali mur. and Kali iod. in various forms of\\n      choroiditis and retinitis.\\n      \\n XII. -The beneficial effects of many\\n      remedies, especially of Nux and Phos., in inflammatory affections of the\\n      optic nerve and in atrophic conditions, cerebral and spinal.\\n      \\n These are some of the solid facts of\\n      Homoeopathic therapeutics which cannot be controverted.\\n      \\n As our knowledge of Materia Medica\\n      increases, especially as the pathogeneses of drugs are more accurately and\\n      scientifically developed, our success will be measurably increased. There\\n      is some evidence as to the efficiency of Gels., Bry., Col., and other\\n      remedies in glaucoma, but the well-known influence of eserine and\\n      iridectomy makes it unjustifiable to withhold them in the majority of\\n      cases. The symptomatology of Osmium gives us a very suggestive picture of\\n      glaucoma. It ought to be helpful, though I am not conversant with any\\n      positive clinical evidence in proof of its efficacy. When a careful record\\n      of the tension, of the acuity and of the field of vision and of the\\n      ophthalmoscopic appearance of the fundus appears in our provings, then we\\n      may hope to dispense with myotics and iridectomy in the treatment of this\\n      disease.\\n      \\n The influence of some of our remedies\\n      in checking the development of cataract, and of materially improving\\n      vision by the resolution of cortical opacities has been abundantly proved,\\n      and affords a striking instance of the superiority of Homoeopathic ocular\\n      therapeutics. Where do we find any such results from Old-School treatment\\n      as those published in recent years by some of our specialists of\\n      recognized ability, whose statements are trustworthy, and whose diagnoses\\n      are beyond question? The experience of Dr. Wm. R. King, [See Journal of\\n      O., and L., April, 1891.] of Washington, with Iodoform is especially\\n      noteworthy.\\n      \\n The treatment of cataract with remedies\\n      must, of course, rest upon a constitutional basis. Eye-symptoms alone do\\n      not afford sufficient data for the choice of a drug. The underlying\\n      condition is the important point to consider.\\n      \\n An interesting illustration of the\\n      value of such a method of prescribing, and also of the fact previously\\n      noted, that a remedy may cure an eye-affection when indicated by\\n      constitutional symptoms, even though its pathogenesis contains nothing to\\n      indicate its special action on the eye, is afforded by a case of ptosis\\n      cured with Bromine 6x by Dr. Bissell, of Rochester, reported in the\\n      Journal of O., O. and L., for October, 1889. Bromine was selected on\\n      account of diarrhoea, eructations, pain like needles at the epigastrium\\n      and physometra.\\n      \\n Bisulphide of carbon is worthy of trial\\n      in retrobulbar neuritis. Cases of poisoning suggest it Homoeopathically to\\n      this affection. It has produced in several cases, \"diminution of\\n      vision, central scotoma, vision better in the evening, loss of\\n      appreciation of color, central scotoma for colors, and narrowing of\\n      eccentric field,\" without ophthalmic changes in the fundus oculi.\\n      Hirshberge described in one case \"an alteration of the macula\\n      characterized by the presence of whitish nodules.\" These visual\\n      disturbances are associated with nervous symptoms, such as muscular\\n      weakness of the limbs, cramps in the legs and abdomen, diminution of\\n      hearing and headache. [See article by H.H. Crippen in O., O, and L.,\\n      April, 1891].\\n      \\n Malignant growths of the eye and lids\\n      have seldom been materially influenced by remedies, yet we now and then\\n      see a gleam of light in this direction which encourages us to hope for\\n      better results in the future. Such hints from accurate observers should be\\n      carefully noted and remembered, and therefore I desire to call your\\n      attention to the report of a case of sarcoma by Dr. W.S. Searle, of\\n      Brooklyn. [+ Journal of O., O. and L., February, 1892.] A blind eye had\\n      been removed, and microscopical examination demonstrated the correctness\\n      of a previous diagnosis by Dr. H. Knapp, viz., spindle-called sarcoma of\\n      the choroid. Ten days after removal, a secondary growth \"of the size\\n      of a chestnut\" was removed from the orbit, and Phos. and Tarentula\\n      cubensis were prescribed. The former was chosen on account of general\\n      constitutional indications, and the latter from its reputation in\\n      inflammatory affections of connective tissue, especially in boils and\\n      carbuncles. After their use there was no return for nine months. Then the\\n      growth again returned to as light extent, but under a renewal of the\\n      former prescription the nodule shrivelled and dropped off within a week,\\n      and the doctor wrote me recently that there had been no recurrence of the\\n      disease up to present time, a period of two years since the second\\n      operation.\\n      \\n These remedies are worthy of trial in\\n      similar cases, and i would also remind you of the published experience of\\n      the late Dr. George S. Norton and of Dr. French in the treatment of glioma\\n      retinae with Ceanothus Americanus, the fluid extract of red clover\\n      blossoms. [See O., O. and L., April, 1890, and Trans. Am. Inst, 1884.].\\n      \\n The value of Cinnabar as a remedy for\\n      ciliary neuralgias has been often demonstrated, where the indication of\\n      \"pain extending from the inner canthus around the brow\" is\\n      present, but we owe to Dr. H.C. French a confirmation of the following\\n      indication for its employment, viz., \"a full, heavy feeling in the\\n      whole head, temporarily lessened by pressure.\" \"Shooting pains\\n      in the forehead.\" \"Sticking and itching in both canthi and in\\n      the forehead.\" The patient had been under Old-School treatment for\\n      two years, and Dr. French gave him great relief in a few hours, and cured\\n      him in less than three weeks with Cinnabar.\\n      \\n The curative influence of Agaricus in\\n      spasmodic affections of the lids and ocular muscles has log been\\n      recognized, but its influence in amaurosis and hysterical amblyopia was\\n      first suggested to me by an article by Dr. Rounds. [+ See Journal of O.,\\n      O. and L., October, 1891.] Some slight impairment of vision is suggested\\n      in the proving of the remedy, but that a total blindness of both\\n      eyes-\"only slight perception of strong light remaining\"-should\\n      be entirely cured, and perfect vision restored after the patient had been\\n      blind for several years, is certainly surprising and worthy of note. The\\n      sight of the right eye was suddenly lost after a blow upon the head four\\n      years before treatment was commenced, and that of the left eye as suddenly\\n      and completely failed after exposure to rain. For two years she could not\\n      tell night from day. The only other treatment employed was galvanism, and\\n      as this was used without avail for two months before prescribing Agaricus\\n      it seems reasonable to attribute the recovery in large measure to the\\n      medicine, although electricity was continued at irregular and increasing\\n      intervals during the time of treatment. Nystagmus, nictitation and other\\n      nervous and hysterical symptoms led to the choice. The ophthalmoscopic\\n      examination was negative. Fifteen drops of the tincture of Agaricus were\\n      taken daily in divided doses for a period of eight months, when the\\n      patient was discharged with perfect vision in each eye, and entirely free\\n      from nystagmus, etc. She has since earned her own living as a stenographer\\n      and typewriter.\\n      \\n Experience has repeatedly proved the\\n      efficacy of Gelsemium in various diseases of the eye, especially where\\n      serous exudation exists, and in paretic affection of the muscles, but Its\\n      Homoeopathicity to amaurotic affections is suggested by the following\\n      observation of Dr. W.A. Phillips. In a certain patient, 5 gtts. doses of\\n      the tincture invariably produced the characteristic symptoms of giddiness,\\n      headache and heaviness of the lids, followed by almost total loss of\\n      vision. At one time the accommodation failed first, while at another the\\n      sensibility to retinal impression seemed to precede the loss of\\n      adjustment. In forty minutes after the five drops were taken the vision\\n      was reduced to 3/200. It could not be improved by lenses, and this\\n      diminution continued from five to fifteen minutes. Normal vision returned\\n      in from one-half to two hours. No ophthalmoscopic changes were observed.\\n      [See O. and O., April 1, 1890.].\\n      \\n Paris quadrifolia is a valuable remedy\\n      in certain cases of asthenopia. The sensation \"as if the eyes were\\n      being drawn back into the head by cords\" is a reliable indication for\\n      its employment, and led the writer to select it, and to effect a\\n      gratifying cure of chronic headache. Dr. French cured with Paris a\\n      paralysis of the external rectus where this symptom was present. He also\\n      emphasizes the following as trustworthy guides for its use, viz.,\\n      \"inability of fix the eyes steadily upon anything; eyes seem swollen,\\n      as if their orbits were to small, so that the eyes could not be easily\\n      moved.\" [+ See Journal of O., O. and L., January, 1889.].\\n      \\n Kalmia is helpful is certain cases of\\n      asthenopia. Dr. Boyle has had gratifying success with it in episcleritis\\n      and tendonitis, [++ See Trons N.Y. State Sac., 1891.] where the patient\\n      complained of \"soreness of the eyeballs to touch and motion\"\\n      \"Injection of the conjunctiva, chemosis around the cornea.\"\\n      \"Feeling of stiffness of the muscles.\".\\n      \\n The pathogenesis of Cannabis sat. and\\n      Cannabis ind. exhibit a striking similarity to pterygium, and they ought\\n      to be curative of that condition. They have been curative in vascular\\n      condition of the cornea, and Dr. Wanstall cured with Cannabis ind. a case\\n      of pustular keratitis, with pterygium-like injection of the conjunctiva.\\n      [See Norton\\'s Ophthalmic Diseases and Therapeutics.].\\n      \\n Chrysophanic acid should be remembered\\n      in cases of chronic ciliary blepharitis, especially in scrofulous,\\n      ill-nourished children. The writer on one occasion prescribed an ointment\\n      composed of eight grains of the acid to an ounce of vaseline, to be\\n      cautiously used on the edges of the lids. The patient, thinking if a\\n      little was good a great deal was better, applied it freely over all the\\n      lids and conjunctiva. A very inflammation followed, but the blepharitis\\n      was permanently cured.\\n      \\n The homoeopathicity of Colocynth to\\n      iritis characterized by burning, sticking, cutting pains, extending from\\n      the eyes into the head, increased at night and by stooping, lessened by\\n      pressure and walking in a warm room, was exemplified by an experience of\\n      the writer, where the disease, if not primarily caused as there seemed\\n      reason to believe, was without doubt markedly aggravated by the use of a\\n      hair wash containing Colocynth. [+ See North Am. Journal of Homoeopathy,\\n      1887.].\\n      \\n The successful use of hypericum in\\n      injuries of parts rich in nerves, and in pains from old cicatrices, led\\n      Dr. Moffat to prescribe it with benefit in pain arising from anterior\\n      synechiae after the patient had suffered several years.\\n      \\n In conclusion, let me again emphasize\\n      the need of careful examinations of the eyes of persons, and the accurate\\n      record of variations of tension, of visual disturbances, of skilled\\n      specialists, in order that subjective symptoms may be correctly\\n      interpreted, and our symptomatology be more scientific and reliable. Every\\n      committee of provers, every Materia Medica laboratory should have a\\n      competent oculist.\\n      \\n Let me urge upon our specialists the\\n      duty of careful prescribing, of painstaking detailed records, and of\\n      publication of successes and of failure with remedies Homoeopathically\\n      prescribed, that we may attain greater accuracy in prescribing, that our\\n      knowledge of the positive effects of drugs may be extended, and that we\\n      may achieve greater success in the treatment of eye-affections according\\n      to the law of \"Similia Similibus Curantur,\" and relegate\\n      operative measures and local treatment more and more to positions of a\\n      secondary importance. The day is surely coming when Homoeopathy will be\\n      universally recognized as the \"Science of Therapeutics,\" and\\n      when the Homoeopathic specialist will be the exponent of the highest\\n      degree of scientific and skilful treatment.\\n      \\n DISCUSSION.\\n      \\n J.H. BUFFUM, M.D.: Dr. Linnell has\\n      presented to the Congress an able epitome of the present status of\\n      ophthalmic therapeutics, which must carry with it the conviction of truth.\\n      Perhaps, in no department of medicine have such advances been made in\\n      diagnosis, prognosis, and pathology, as in that of ophthalmology, until it\\n      has now become one of the most exact and scientific in the domain of the\\n      healing art.\\n      \\n Small as the organs of sight are, as\\n      compared with other organs of the human body, their relation to the whole\\n      animal economy is such as to carry with it need for a full knowledge of\\n      not only the anatomy, physiology, and pathology, of all organs, but also\\n      their dependence, in health or disease, to the various affections of the\\n      eye. On the other hand, the ophthalmologist has been able to determine the\\n      exact relation which certain conditions of the eye, either physiological\\n      or pathological, bear to various diseases which are termed reflex and\\n      general.\\n      \\n As Homoeopathic ophthalmologists, we\\n      should carry our Homoeopathy into our practice, not only as followers of\\n      the wisdom and philosophy which emanated from Hahnemann, who gave us a\\n      universal law of cure, but also, because we owe it to our clients who\\n      confide their cases to us and expect to be cured homoeopathically,\\n      primarily, and secondarily only, when we have failed from a want of\\n      knowledge of our Materia Medica Pura.\\n      \\n The ophthalmic practitioner of our\\n      school has had, until the last few years, but little to aid or encourage\\n      him in his adherence to the tenets of his faith, owing to the fact that\\n      the basis of his knowledge of drugs in their active relation to eye\\n      diseases has been uncertain, as too often the pathogenesis, as set forth\\n      in the provings of the remedies was found thoroughly unreliable when\\n      applied to the treatment of the eye.\\n      \\n Hence, the older ophthalmic surgeons of\\n      our school have had to acquire from close study and observation of the\\n      clinical effect of our drugs, a system of ophthalmic therapeutics derived\\n      from our knowledge of our Materia Medica, and their own clinical\\n      observation, which is now rapidly being augmented by the increased number\\n      of workers in this department. Eventually, in the coming years, when the\\n      true laborers in the field of Homoeopathic, ocular therapy have brought in\\n      the harvest of pathogenetic, clinical, and curative symptoms, we shall\\n      find, when the grain is separated from the chaff, that but little remains\\n      to desire, save the proper application of this accumulated knowledge to\\n      the scientific Homoeopathic cure of all ophthalmic diseases.\\n      \\n It is difficult supplement the careful\\n      resume of the verified action and indications of the homoeopathic remedies\\n      which have so ably been demonstrated in the paper which is before us for\\n      discussion. Dr. Linnell has, with the utmost care, culled from our\\n      literature the most valuable verifications of Homoeopathy as applied to\\n      the treatment of ocular diseases. It remains, then, only for me to add\\n      what may have come to may knowledge as result of my own individual\\n      experience and observation in ophthalmic practice; amplifying here and\\n      there, and presenting perhaps, now and then a grain of pure gold, which\\n      years of study and observation have enabled me to separate fro the dross\\n      which surrounded it.\\n      \\n The poverty of the armamentarium\\n      medicum of the Old-School, in its application to ocular therapeutics is\\n      manifested, not so much in its lessened number of drugs for internal\\n      medication, as in the want of specific indications for their use. The\\n      richness of our drug armament stands out in glittering contrast, not\\n      perhaps by the greater number of remedies, but by the knowledge of our\\n      Homoeopathic law which enables us to prescribe these drugs with an\\n      assurance of the curative results which inevitably must follow their\\n      proper administration.\\n      \\n It is not necessary to discuss seriatim\\n      the list of verities of Homoeopathic ocular therapeutics which Dr. Linnell\\n      has presented, as they are no longer in doubt. We should all endeavor, as\\n      soon as possible, to increase their number by adding to those mentioned\\n      other rich in possibilities, but which yet lack that confirmation which\\n      must come from repeated trials.\\n      \\n In the list presented I desire to\\n      emphasize the actions of Homoeopathic so-called constitutional remedies in\\n      lessening and dissipating the various dyscrasias mentioned, and thus\\n      enabling us to cure the alternate effects as exhibited in the eye.\\n      \\n The actions of those remedies mentioned\\n      as controlling inflammatory effects of the eye, we all daily prove the\\n      truth of in our practice.\\n      \\n In reference to the action of Rhus tox.\\n      in promoting, controlling, and limiting various traumatic and surgical\\n      inflammations, perhaps little need be said, but for Hepar sulph. which has\\n      exhibited such marvelous action in controlling, limiting, and absorbing\\n      pus within the eye, too much praise cannot to given. With these two\\n      remedies eyesight and eyeball have been saved time and again, when no\\n      other known treatment could possibly have controlled the inflammation,\\n      lessened the pain, saved tissue, and caused the absorption of the products\\n      of inflammatory attacks. To watch the action of either, when indicated in\\n      these affections of the eye makes one feel that our remedies have an\\n      action only short of the miraculous.\\n      \\n In iritis the action of Terebinth,\\n      which, in the Old School, finds a place of value, is with us too often\\n      neglected, as, like Asafoetida, it has a specific action upon the inflamed\\n      iris, and both not only lessen the ciliary neuralgia but shorten and cure\\n      the attack.\\n      \\n In controlling the inflammatory and\\n      degenerative changes in the lens which result in cataract, the action of\\n      our remedies presents often in my experience the further proof of the\\n      Homoeopathic law of cure.\\n      \\n In the lens, as well as in the cornea,\\n      iris, vitreous, retina, and choroid, we can watch from day to day the\\n      limiting, absorption, and sight-restoring effects of our remedies.\\n      \\n Glaucoma, when presenting a mechanical\\n      obstruction of the excretion of the fluids of the eye, cannot come under\\n      the domain of medicine; but for those glaucomatous conditions which are\\n      dependent upon the hypersecretions resulting from neurotic irritations,\\n      the remedies mentioned by Dr. Linnell often afford us brilliant results.\\n      In simple non-inflammatory glaucoma of chronic type, Sulphur, Nux vomica,\\n      and Phosphorus have controlled the disease and saved the vision in cases\\n      where neither iridectomy, sclerotomy, or myotomy had been allowed, and\\n      also in cases where some or all of these operations had been made without\\n      control of this sight-destroying disease.\\n      \\n In addition to those that have been\\n      mentioned in the paper, there are some affections of the eye and the\\n      therapeutic means for their relief to which I desire to call attention as\\n      exhibiting the desired action of our remedies.\\n      \\n Hyperaemia of the retina, while usually\\n      symptomatic, is, I believe, more often idiopathic than we are inclined to\\n      think. While this condition is difficult of diagnosis, owing to the\\n      variableness of the circulation of the retina within physiological limits\\n      of the individuals, and in cases where such immediate causes as refractive\\n      errors, foreign bodies, or inflammation of the contiguous tissues of the\\n      choroid and iris have been excluded, we are justified in making such a\\n      diagnosis. I find that taking the increased capillary circulation of the\\n      optic disk as an indication, rather than that of the retinal vessels,\\n      together with the subjective symptoms of asthenopia, a safe guide to the\\n      diagnosis of a condition which often presents a series of symptoms\\n      extremely annoying to the patient and often difficult of relief, unless we\\n      find in such remedies as Belladonna, Cactus, Cimicifuga, Duboisia, Amyl\\n      nit., and Phosphorus the similimum.\\n      \\n Cases of temporary amblyopia which\\n      arise from spasm of the retinal arteries or result from vaso-motor\\n      irritation of the cerebroretinal circulation, and thus temporarily disturb\\n      the nutrition of the optic nerve and retina and destroy its function, more\\n      frequently once to the notice of the general practitioner than to the\\n      ophthalmologist.\\n      \\n Such amblyopias, while often temporary\\n      and symptomatic of the cephalalgia which follows, sometimes tend to be\\n      persistent, and even when the amblyopia has disappeared we may find\\n      scotomas, which become sources of discomfort or causes of subjective\\n      symptoms, which make difficult the diagnosis of the eye condition.\\n      \\n In these cases, where there is found a\\n      migraine history, recent or remote, there are three remedies which cover a\\n      multitude of discomforting symptoms, namely, Gelsemium, Physostigma, and\\n      Strychnia phos. .\\n      \\n For the amblyopia which precedes the\\n      attacks of headache, and which itself is often preceded by symptoms, more\\n      or less marked, of irritation of the retina, perhaps no remedy is more\\n      valuable the an Amyl nitrite by inhalation, which, while shortening the\\n      attack as far as the disturbance of the vision is concerned, yet lessens\\n      not the tendency to recurrence nor removes the cause. As an example of\\n      what may be accomplished by remedies which, as far as we know, have shown\\n      in their pathogenesis no direct action upon such conditions yet exhibit\\n      their curative powers in a remarkable degree, I take from my case book the\\n      following record of Miss P. aet. 23, who consulted me in 1888, with a\\n      history of temporary amblyopia, which usually occurred only in the right\\n      eye, but occasionally in the left, the attacks coming or in the morning\\n      after breakfast of on awakening, if she had suffered from insomnia. During\\n      the years before consulting me she had had six attacks, whose duration\\n      lasted from an hour to four or five. At the time I saw her a central\\n      scotoma of the right eye was evident, but a diagnosis of circulatory\\n      changes in the eye was doubtful in the inception of the attack, a point of\\n      light was observed by her on the temporal side, which increased until it\\n      became a wave of light. In some of the attacks modified by lying down. Her\\n      eyes were emmetropic and the vision normal. Has no special headaches.\\n      Bryonia was prescribed, and there was no return of the trouble for a year,\\n      when she again had a recurrence of the trouble, and came for some more of\\n      the remedy. In the four years since there has been no return of the\\n      troubles.\\n      \\n Some sixteen years ago, after reading\\n      the experience of Bell and Kuhne in their efforts to demonstrate the\\n      retinal purple, I was impressed with the fact that Muscarine and\\n      Pilocarpine seemed to have the peculiar property of increasing the\\n      secretions of the light discoloring matter which is formed about the base\\n      of the rods of the retina. Acting upon the suggestions thus presented by\\n      the physiological provings of these drugs, I have use them for many years\\n      with success in cases of amblyopia, where I have been able to determine by\\n      exclusion of other causes that the deficient vision was dependent upon a\\n      probable functional derangement of the retina and optic nerve. While I\\n      have already reported the good results following the administration of\\n      Agaricus and Jaborandi in restoring the vision in many cases of what might\\n      be termed torpor-retinae of functional anaesthesia, I have also observed\\n      that Agaricus has a curative result in cases of of hyperaesthesia retinae.\\n      In regard to the action of Agaricus in optic nerve atrophy, I regret to\\n      say that I have been unable to get in improvement in the vision from its\\n      use. Some cases of toxic amblyopia arising from nicotine poisoning, where\\n      the atrophy was only partial, have certainly been benefited by it. Such\\n      remedies as Gelsemium, Ignatia, Phosphorus, Sulphur, and many others might\\n      also be mentioned as having directly or indirectly a marked action in\\n      improving the functional activity of the retina. In hyperaesthetic\\n      conditions of the retina, where all local, refractive, and reflex causes\\n      have been removed, the action of the Homoeopathic attenuated drugs, such\\n      as Macrotin, Hyoscyamine, Atropine, Conium, Agaricus, Nux vomica, and\\n      Ignatia, are often marvelous in the rapidity of their action. The results\\n      obtained from the proper administration of the indicated remedies in these\\n      cases where the failure from the more general treatment of the opposing\\n      school of medicine is common, are the more remarkable, and tend to give\\n      one new effort and a desire to place again and again fresh laurels upon\\n      the already well crowned head of Hahnemann.\\n      \\n The results obtained by the\\n      Homoeopathic administration of Physostigma, Jaborandi, Gelsemium,\\n      Agaricus, in cases of spasm of the accommodation associated with\\n      refractive errors, have enabled me for the last ten years to do away with\\n      the use of Atropia, Homatropine, Hyoscyamine, and other mydriatics which\\n      are commonly considered necessary for the paralysis of the accommodation\\n      in the prescription of glasses. It has been my experience that the results\\n      of my prescriptions for correcting lenses have been much more satisfactory\\n      than when I have used mydriatics, and where the reflex symptoms arising\\n      from eye-strain, such as neuralgia and headaches and other more remote\\n      neuroses, were often relieved before the glasses were prescribed.\\n      \\n Again, it may be said that these and\\n      other remedies relieve the eye stain of both the intrinsic and extrinsic\\n      muscles of the ball, as reflexes, when the total optical defect has been\\n      corrected by the prescription of glasses, based upon the supposed complete\\n      paralysis of the accommodation under Atropia or some other drug similar in\\n      action.\\n      \\n In the insufficiencies of the recti\\n      muscles, whether the cases exhibit an exophoria, esophoria, or a\\n      hyperphoria, we find that a close study of our cases with the prescription\\n      of such remedies as Argent.nit., Nat.mur., Gels., Senega, Physostigma,\\n      Agaricus, Mercurius, and Phosphorus, we are time and again not only to\\n      relieve the discomfort attendant upon the muscular deficiency, but also to\\n      avoid the aftermath of graduated tenotomies which daily confront us in\\n      search of relief which even our Homoeopathic law cannot repair. Thanks to\\n      the increasing intelligence of the medical profession the fad of to-day,\\n      whether in our department of medicine or in any other, is dead to-morrow,\\n      but while our colleagues in general medicine and surgery may bury their\\n      dead, ours too often with practically useless organs of sight confront us\\n      with their tale of woe in their tenotomized and be-prismed eyes.\\n      \\n Careful study, the painstaking\\n      prescription of the Homoeopathic remedy in our department of medicine, not\\n      only gives us the satisfaction of cure where other methods have failed,\\n      but also enables us to thus make a more enduring monument to Hahnemann\\n      than that of bronze which we design to erect to him.\\n      \\n F. PARKE LEWIS, M.D.: Mr. President,\\n      Ladies and Gentlemen: Everything that Dr. Linnell writes is written with\\n      care. I never yet have seen anything from his pen that was not truly worth\\n      reading. It follows, as a matter of course, that the summary of the value\\n      of drugs which he has given us is one which has a very definite and\\n      distinct value. The thesis of this paper, however, is one in which in an\\n      interrogatory way he asks us if we may not accept. It is this: He says:\\n      \"Knowing that certain constitutional symptoms are accompanied with\\n      morbid conditions, and having cured this condition by the exhibition of\\n      the similimum, are we not justified in saying that any subsequent case, in\\n      which the morbid condition the eye alone appears, we may assume that had\\n      the drug in the proving been given long enough the condition of the eye\\n      would have disappeared, and that we may take that as a basis for\\n      subsequent precipitations of that drug?\" Can we? I wish I could\\n      believe absolutely that that were true, because it would give us a basis\\n      for the exhibition of our Homoeopathic remedies, a very true and very sure\\n      one. In other words, if it were always possible to say that because\\n      certain conditions have been cured by the exhibition of a certain remedy,\\n      we may assume that when these conditions of the eye appear independent of\\n      the constitutional conditions that appear in the first place, that we will\\n      also cure that disease. I think we would have a certainty in the\\n      application of our Materia Medica that to say I do not always feel, and I\\n      question whether we may accept in its entirely the thesis of Dr. Linnell\\'s\\n      paper. The case in cites, for instance, of Dr. Bissell\\'s, is it seems to\\n      me, a classical one. Bromium was given for certain constitutional\\n      troubles, accompanied by ptosis- the ptosis disappeared. We had a definite\\n      Homoeopathic prescription, followed by a cure; but are we justified in\\n      presuming that, should ptosis appear without these constitutional\\n      symptoms, Bromium is going to cure that Ptosis? I do not believe that we\\n      can always do that. The consequence is that we have in our Materia Medica\\n      a great many symptoms which we accept as verifications, about which, in my\\n      mind, there is question. Immensely valuable suggestions, immensely\\n      valuable to us in our prescriptions, but not symptoms upon which we can\\n      pin our faith with absolute reliance. For instance, I have frequently\\n      given Gelsemium in iritis, and have not cured my case; therefore I have\\n      concluded that Gelsemium is not the remedy for iritis. It may be, but it\\n      is not always. The reason I believe that we have such a small proportion\\n      of definite symptoms connected with the eye in our Materia Medica, is only\\n      partially due to the fact that we have not had skilled specialists to make\\n      examinations of these conditions; it is only partially due to that. I come\\n      more and more to believe that the eyes is not, in a very large proportion\\n      of cases, directly and specifically acted upon by drugs administered\\n      internally. I wish to be understood in this matter. I am not in any degree\\n      under-estimating the immense value of Homoeopathic therapeutics in\\n      diseases of the eyes; I am simply questioning the application of this\\n      therapeutics. I am by no means criticising the results which have been\\n      obtained in the hands of our careful prescribers. That those results have\\n      been obtained, I also have no doubt; but I do believe that a large\\n      proportion of the diseases of the eye (if we exclude traumatism,\\n      refractive and muscular troubles-I mean traumatism of bright sunlight on\\n      the retina)-are the results of diseases of some of the other organs of the\\n      system; some of the great organs of the nervous system, or of the\\n      circulatory system. And unless we take into account the power which each\\n      of these conditions may have upon the disease of the eye, I am inclined to\\n      think that we lessen rather than increase our knowledge of the therapeutic\\n      action of drugs upon the eye. I hope I make myself hear in that, because I\\n      have such an unbounded faith in Homoeopathic remedies in diseases of the\\n      eye that I do not wish to be wrongly understood in the matter. But as to\\n      the methods we sometimes adopt in determining the action of drugs upon the\\n      eye, I think there is room for frequent error. It is unnecessary to talk\\n      to those who are thoroughly informed-as thoroughly informed as those are\\n      to whom I am speaking-in regard to the nature of diseases of the eye, and\\n      the necessity of exact diagnosis; and yet I believe that in the\\n      administration of drugs therapeutically, an exceedingly exact diagnosis\\n      must be made, otherwise we are apt to be led into error. To explain what I\\n      mean more particularly: I remember trying for a long time to treat a\\n      peculiar form of cataract (a dotted condition of the lens, which I have\\n      seen in several instances), and without any appreciable effect. I\\n      subsequently found that there was present in that case a refractive\\n      condition, which had been overlooked, a slight difference in the foci of\\n      the two eyes, and the correction of which absolutely corrected the whole\\n      difficulty. In other words, it relieved the strain on the ciliary muscle,\\n      it relieved the nutrition of the eye, and the eye cleared in consequence.\\n      I don\\'t mean to say that that kind of cataract come inevitably as a result\\n      of muscular or ciliary strain, but I do mean to say that in a very large\\n      proportion of these cases the correction of muscular and of refractive\\n      errors will eliminate the necessity for the exhibition of internal\\n      medication.\\n      \\n I am very much interested in what Dr.\\n      Buffum has said in regard to the action of drugs in relieving and curing\\n      ciliary spasm. I was very much interested twelve or fifteen years ago when\\n      Dr. Woodyatt announced the value that he had obtained for Argentum\\n      nitricum in those troubles, possibly because I have not had opportunity of\\n      following those cases as I would like to; but I never have had the\\n      entirely satisfactory results in internal medication, in focal and\\n      refractive troubles, which others seem to have had. Where there is a\\n      muscular condition which is not benefited, I have almost always found\\n      those conditions return for further treatment.', 'Lycopene is a bright red pigment that is naturally found in the human liver, serum (blood), adrenal glands, lungs, prostate, colon, and skin at higher levels than other similar pigments. In animal studies, lycopene has been found to have antioxidant effects and may also block cancer cell growth. However, there is still controversy over whether it has these effects in humans.Many studies suggest that eating lycopene-rich foods or having high lycopene levels in the body may be linked to reduced risk of cancer, heart disease, and age-related eye disorders. However, measures of lycopene intake have been based on eating tomatoes, not on the use of lycopene supplements. Since tomatoes also contain other nutrients, such as vitamin C and potassium, the potential benefits of lycopene alone are still unclear.Lycopene deficiency is not considered a medical condition. There is a lack of evidence on whether increasing low lycopene levels may benefit health.', 'Tresorie - THE YEARS PROGRESS IN OBSTETRICS [Years Progress In\\nObstetrics]\\n\\n FOR several years progress in the art\\n      of obstetrics has been mainly along surgical lines, until so much\\n      operative work now pertains to the complete practice of this branch, that\\n      he who expects to rely upon himself in the hour of emergency must possess\\n      surgical skill. Moreover, requirements for the successful practice of\\n      obstetrics are daily becoming more exacting. Midwives and incompetents\\n      will ultimately be driven out of the field by the lash of public\\n      sentiment.\\n      \\n Symphyseotomy.-The old operations of\\n      Sigault, known as symphyseotomy, which had quite a run in the latter part\\n      of the last century, has been received in this our day by the Obstetric\\n      School of Naples, and thus far has a good record. In this country it has\\n      been employed but a few times, but the sentiment of accoucheurs appears to\\n      be friendly toward it.\\n      \\n It is only occasionally appropriate,\\n      and probably far less frequently in this country, and especially in the\\n      west, than in the more densely settled countries of Europe, where\\n      pauperism is more prevalent, and the people are harder worked and more\\n      poorly fed.\\n      \\n Ever since the original operation of\\n      Sigault fell into desuetude, obstetrician have busied themselves in\\n      efforts to devise methods for reducing the size of the fetal head to\\n      correspond to pelvic dimensions, and as a result, thousands of foetal\\n      lives have been sacrificed for want of the very expedient which had been\\n      cast aside.\\n      \\n It is unnecessary for me to sway that\\n      the secret of our success with Sigault\\'s operation to-day is found in\\n      cleaner methods and finer technique.\\n      \\n For some years Caesarean section has\\n      been the standard operation for in which the antero-posterior diameter of\\n      the brim was reduced as low as 2 3/4 inches; but recently a living child\\n      has been delivered by means of symphyseotomy when the diameter was only 2\\n      2/3 inches. The wonderful improvement in obstetrical results which this\\n      affords is at once apparent when we consider the vast difference in point\\n      of mortality between the two operations, Caesarean section and\\n      symphyseotomy. Nor is maternal life preserved at the expense of subsequent\\n      misery, for according to the reports thus far made, there are no disabling\\n      effects produced in the woman as the result of temporary disarticulation\\n      of the pubic bones.\\n      \\n Still we are recollect that the\\n      operation is yet on trial, and should lay corresponding restraint on our\\n      enthusiasm. The true value of it can better be told in a twelve-month.\\n      \\n After the os uteri has become fully\\n      dilated, and futile attempts have been to deliver with the forceps, or as\\n      soon as we find that the foetal head is unquestionably so decidedly out of\\n      proportion to the size of the pelvis delivery of a living child cannot be\\n      effected, the time has arrived for the performance of symphyseotomy.\\n      \\n The field of the operation is prepared\\n      in the usual manner (which preparation should include shaving the mons\\n      veneris and vulva), and an incision is made about two inches long in the\\n      median line, the lower limit of it being a point just above the clitoris.\\n      A few fibres of the rectus muscle are separated from the pubes on either\\n      side of the median line, and the finger is passed down along the posterior\\n      surface of the symphysis. Using the finger as both director and protector,\\n      a curved probe-pointed bistoury is then made to severe the articular soft\\n      structures, including the sub-public ligament, great care being exercised\\n      to avoid wounding the other structures. The articular surfaces are gently\\n      separated a few lines, the wound is examined for bleeding points, these\\n      being secured with fine catgut, temporary gauze packing is used and the\\n      forceps are applied. Delivery should be practiced with great care, and\\n      during traction effort the trochanters should be supported by the hands of\\n      an assistant. After delivery of the placenta the gauze is removed, the\\n      control of all bleeding assured, the articular surfaces are brought\\n      together and held by silkworm-gut sutures through the fibrous structures\\n      along the face of the bones, which fall within easy reach, and then the\\n      external wound is closed. In exceptional cases it may be wise to practice\\n      drainage for twenty-four hours. A tight bandage should be applied to the\\n      hips and firmly secured. The recumbent posture should be enforced for\\n      about four weeks.\\n      \\n The Caesarean Operation.-I am not aware\\n      that there has been any improvement worthy of mention in the technique of\\n      the Caesarean operation or its modification during the past year; but the\\n      sentiment is becoming nearly universal that the operation should be\\n      regarded as elective in the matter of time.\\n      \\n Formerly, the custom was to resort to\\n      surgical interference only after labor had been well established, and\\n      that, too, even in cases wherein delivery per vias naturales had been\\n      recognized as impossible.\\n      \\n Without pausing here to note the\\n      objections which have been made to early interposition, I may be allowed\\n      to emphasize the advantages arising from ante-partum operation, viz.:.\\n      \\n 1. A better opportunity for deliberate\\n      and painstaking preparation on the part of the operator is afforded.\\n      \\n 2. Daylight can be assured.\\n      \\n 3. The patient can be more thoroughly\\n      prepared.\\n      \\n 4. The vital powers of the woman have\\n      not become seriously impaired.\\n      \\n In view of the bearing of exact pelvic\\n      and cranial measurements on the selection of the most suitable operation\\n      for an individual case, I should not omit to direct your attention to the\\n      demand for more frequent use of the pelvimeter and careful estimate has\\n      established.\\n      \\n Sanger vs Parro.-Caesarean section,\\n      pure and simple, as practiced by Sanger, and Caesarean section as modified\\n      by Porro, are still rivals for surgical favor. In Italy, where it\\n      originated, the Porro operation is by far the most popular, while in\\n      Germany Sanger\\'s operation is in greater favor. the surgeons of this\\n      country have exhibited a preference for the latter method, though some of\\n      the best operators are outspoken in their preference for the former. Dr.\\n      Robert P. Harris, whose statistics are most elaborate and reliable,\\n      believes that Americans have food reason for preferring the improved\\n      Caesarean operation, inasmuch as twelve out of twenty-eight Porro\\n      subjects, up to the present time, have died, against five out of the last\\n      twenty- eight delivered under the other method. On the other hand,\\n      \"our success,\" says Dr. Joseph Price, who has thus far produced\\n      the best statistics of personal abdominal work which the world affords,\\n      \"in supra-vaginal extra-peritoneal hysterectomy for fibroids, and the\\n      low mortality accompanying the operation has assured our faith in the\\n      Porro operation.\" \"Hysterectomy should be performed,\" he\\n      continues, \"wherever the Caesarean section is necessary.\" Thus\\n      the controversy goes on, but out of the din and smoke of the tumult we\\n      gather indications of the advantage of the Porro over the Sanger operation\\n      for the use of the average surgeon and gynaecologist outside of hospital\\n      walls. It is more easily and expeditiously performed, and, what to my mind\\n      commends it still more, the possibility of future impregnation is\\n      prevented. The sentimentality in which some indulge, and the amiability\\n      which would encourage reproduction by such women of weak, deformed, and\\n      usually dependent children, should be discountenanced. The record which\\n      Rosenburg found of thirty-six cases wherein Caesarean section has been\\n      performed from two to five times on the same woman, is to my mind deeply\\n      revolting.\\n      \\n As in the case of supra-vaginal\\n      hysterectomy under other circumstances, some late operators have treated\\n      the stump according to various intra-abdominal or intra-pelvic, of not\\n      strictly intra-peritoneal, methods, but the ordinary operator will still\\n      prefer to fasten the stump at the abdominal opening.\\n      \\n Caesarean Operations vs.\\n      Craniotomy.-The accoucheur who possesses surgical skill will hereafter\\n      reserve his perforator, his craniotomy forceps, and his cephalotribe for\\n      use only upon the dead foetus, for, with the child still living, abdominal\\n      section and symphyseotomy are the operations to be considered. Upon a dead\\n      foetus, in a pelvis measuring in e excess of 3 or at the least 2 1/2\\n      inches, such instruments will afford occasional aid, but not elsewhere.\\n      This is the dictum of late obstetrical authorities, and yet I can conceive\\n      of an occasional case in the experience of those who have no surgical\\n      skill themselves and cannot readily summon those who do possess it,\\n      wherein an exception to this rule may properly lie. The practitioner who\\n      is inexperienced in surgery of the abdomen, but who is accustomed to\\n      obstetrical manipulation, will be instruments than with the knife; and to\\n      such cases, with an environment decidedly unfavorable so for as concerns\\n      consultative facilities, rigid rules cannot be applied.\\n      \\n Ischio-Pubiotomy.-I should not fail to\\n      refer to a congener of symphyseotomy known as Farabeuf\\'s a operation,\\n      which consists of section of the pelvis at a point about 2 inches to the\\n      right or left of the symphysis pubis, according to the direction of the\\n      pelvic contraction. It is intended for cases of obliquely contracted\\n      pelvis, wherein symphyseotomy would be comparatively ineffectual. The most\\n      recent example of this operation, of which I have seen a report, is from\\n      the clinic of Prof. Pinard, of Paris.\\n      \\n In order to make the result of this\\n      operation satisfactory, as it appears to me, the greatest care will be\\n      requisite, owing to the presence, at the site of section as designated, of\\n      the obturator nerve which supplies adductor muscles of the thigh. In\\n      measurements recently made on the cadaver, I find that the point of exit\\n      of this nerve, at the upper and inner margin of the obturator foramen, is\\n      just 2 inches form the symphysis. The obturator vessels are also found at\\n      the same point. To go to the outer side of this opening would materially\\n      diminish the danger of section, but the operator must recollect that that\\n      the nerve there lies close to the lower border of the horizontal ramus of\\n      the pubis. If section is made at a nearer point the body of thee pubis\\n      alone will be cut, and, owing to proximity of this line of incision to the\\n      symphysis, the special advantage of the operation over symphyseotomy will\\n      be measurably diminished. The best point for section is probably about 2\\n      1/2 inches fro the symphysis. The direction of the section will be\\n      downwards and somewhat inwards, the chain saw cutting first the transverse\\n      and then the descending pubic rami. Of course, the obturator nerve can be\\n      avoided by careful adjustment of the saw about the transverse ramus.\\n      \\n Pyrexia in the Puerperium.-Advanced\\n      notions concerning the treatment of puerperal pyrexia have been maintained\\n      and strengthened. I have frequently seen the temperature in the puerperium\\n      run up to 103 degree and 104 degree for a few hours and then subside under\\n      the influence of simple remedies, and therefore great haste in the matter\\n      of operative interference is by me discountenanced. But when the\\n      temperature is disposed to remain high, or when there is a decided rigor\\n      at the beginning of the pyrexia, with no explanation traceable to\\n      disturbance distant from the pelvis, little time should be allotted to the\\n      expectant plan of treatment. First of all, let the vagina be washed out\\n      with a gentle stream of hot boiled water. If the symptoms do not improve\\n      within a few hours, or if the temperature is only temporarily lessened,\\n      the uterus should be carefully washed out with plain boiled water, ample\\n      provision being made for the return of the fluid. Then seizing the cervix\\n      with a pair of bullet forceps and drawing it downwards until is within\\n      easy reach, the uterine cavity should be wiped out repeatedly with\\n      pledgets of absorbent cotton or iodoform gauze. If this should fail to\\n      give more than temporary relief, the organ should be curetted and packed\\n      with either iodoform or sterilized gauze, the end of the strip being\\n      allowed to trail into the vagina for drainage purposes. If up to this\\n      point the manipulation has been done with due regard to asepsis, the\\n      packing may safely be left twenty-four hours, and subsequently renewed if\\n      required. It may be unnecessary to say that all this manipulation would\\n      better be left undone unless it be done with strict regard to perfect\\n      cleanliness. A thoroughly clean vulva and vagina and uterus are absolutely\\n      essential, and the fingers of the operator, the instruments, and the\\n      packing material must be above suspicion.\\n      \\n If at the end of twenty-hours after\\n      packing the temperature does not approach normal, and the other symptoms\\n      do not evince corresponding improvement, we are left to infer that the\\n      cause of the disturbance, while originally within the tract which has been\\n      thus treated, has now located itself within the lymphatics, the veins, the\\n      tubes, or has invaded the peritoneal cavity. When this is true some\\n      practice laparotomy without delay, but, in view of the results of such\\n      operations, as shown by reliable statistics, I would still withhold my\\n      hand for a season, men while hoping to obtain from our deep-acting\\n      remedies results unlooked for by Old-School practitioners. This relegates\\n      laparotomy, in such cases, to the place of a dernier of a resort.\\n      \\n Episiotomy.-I am convinced, from what I\\n      have seen and heard, that the operation of episiotomy is far more commonly\\n      used than formerly. About three or four years ago I appealed to several of\\n      operation, and was surprised to find how few had become familiar with it\\n      in a clinical way. At that time I had resorted to it a few times, but of\\n      late I have had rather frequent recourse to it.\\n      \\n Whereas it was my former custom to make\\n      several small incisions on either side of the vulva, I now make but one on\\n      each side, and that of sufficient depth to give the needed circumference.\\n      The authors who mention the subject at all usually advise that the\\n      incisions be made with a knife, and that we leave the integument intact or\\n      nearly so; but this is not my practice. When the perinaeum is bulging, and\\n      the vulvar circle is tense, with every certainty of laceration, I slip the\\n      scissors under the thin margin and cut outwards and backwards from a half\\n      to three- quarters of an inch. By this means the vulvar circumference is\\n      greatly augmented and the perinaeum is saved. After delivery of the\\n      secundines I put two or three catgut sutures into each wound, and the\\n      result is usually a perfect vulva. I confess to a partiality for this\\n      operation, and have yet to meet the case wherein I have had occasion to\\n      regret any resort to it. Immediate Repair of Parturient Lacerations.-The\\n      demand for immediate attention to lacerations involving the vulva and\\n      vagina is becoming more imperative, while some teach and practice\\n      immediate suturing of even cervical rents. Surely the time is ripe for\\n      declaring that the accoucheur who fails to suture vulvar rents is guilty\\n      of gross neglect. Nor should one be allowed to escape censure under the\\n      plea that anything short of an extensive laceration is not reckoned by him\\n      as a laceration.\\n      \\n Suture of such wounds must be thorough,\\n      since otherwise the operations will prove unsatisfactory.\\n      \\n Asepsis.-Essential progress is being\\n      made by the great body of obstetric practitioners in the direction of\\n      thorough cleanliness in midwifery practice, but there is till much room\\n      for reform in this direction. The slackness of man by accoucheurs is truly\\n      appalling. Filthy instruments and filthy fingers appear to be the rule\\n      rather than the exception. Both students and practitioners need education\\n      along this line.\\n      \\n DISCUSSION.\\n      \\n L.C. GROSVENOR, M.D.: I don\\'t know, Mr.\\n      President, that I have anything to say to, this able paper. I have enjoyed\\n      it intensely. It is as full of met as a nut, and I am very glad to see our\\n      Homoeopathic obstetricians coming clear to the front on these very\\n      important subjects.\\n      \\n MARTHA G. RIPLEY, M.D.: I was very much\\n      pleased with the paper, and doubt if I shall be able to add anything to\\n      it. I wish to say that within a year or two I have had what I consider a\\n      very important method of using the forceps. I have never seen it mentioned\\n      in any work-in fact, it is directly in opposition to the rules that were\\n      given me for the use of forceps. In my obstetrical box I carry two sizes\\n      of forceps, the medium and the short, the very small. I have those small\\n      forceps with me at every case, and in cases where I fear a laceration of\\n      the perinaeum when the head bulges on the perinaeum, when I come to that\\n      point I stretch it. If I fear that the outlet is not sufficiently large,\\n      and I judge it impossible for the head to pass, then I take my scissors\\n      and make the last operation spoken of, on each side. When there is any\\n      pain and the ligaments are stretched, I make a cut on each side from a\\n      quarter to a half an inch, as I think best, putting in fingers as they are\\n      needed. That is very much better than is laceration of the perinaeum. I\\n      like that operation very much in case I fear there is to be a laceration.\\n      Now, to avoid a laceration, I have worked over the perinaeum and stretched\\n      it and dilated it as much as possible; then when there is no pain, I put\\n      in my small forceps. If a pain comes, I stop. I work when there is no\\n      pain, when every part is relaxed. I can get then the best results. I have\\n      tried it in hundreds of cases, and I can avoid a laceration of the\\n      perinaeum many times; and if I delivered with the forceps when there was\\n      pain, I would get laceration. I will say this: the patients are not\\n      frightened by the word forceps. I say to them, \"I have a little pair\\n      of spoons here that will help. I will shorten the operation.\" I think\\n      mine are the Higbee forceps -the smallest size you can find.\\n      \\n It has been said that you can use large\\n      forceps as well. I want to say that sometimes I can get along better\\n      without any forceps; but when you depend upon delivering without the pain\\n      and expulsive efforts, of nature, you have got to use a little force.\\n      Sometimes I get along without using any forceps. You cannot use force\\n      without pain:.\\n      \\n DR. HINGSTON: Almost the last words of\\n      one of the doctors was that he believed that it was almost a rule, rather\\n      than the exception, that obstetrical cases were attended without any care\\n      as to asepsis. Now, in my discussion of the paper before this one, I\\n      rather supposed that the people here thought that I was one of that class,\\n      and I don\\'t believe I look like a very dirty man. I am heartily in concord\\n      with the opinion that the greatest aseptic condition should be adhered to;\\n      and when I remarked that I thought it was perhaps better to stay out of\\n      the vagina than to go into it under certain circumstances, I don\\'t want to\\n      be understood that that was my method. On the contrary, if I had had time\\n      to finish, I would have said that after I go away from my cases, I insist\\n      that the nurse shall leave them alone-keep out of that domain. I permit\\n      none of these antiseptic washings that we have here recommended in the\\n      journals and elsewhere, to be carried out every day or twice a day. On the\\n      country, I believe that if we do not have trained nurses, we had better\\n      keep the nurse away from that domain. Let us make the vagina as aseptic as\\n      possible. Let us be as cleanly as possible. These are my views on this\\n      subject, and I was glad that this paper camp up after the other one,\\n      because I felt that I was misunderstood.\\n      \\n H.E. BEEBE, M.D.: The measures\\n      recommended are all very good, but I think it is quite well proven that of\\n      later years laceration of the perinaeum is more frequent when the\\n      shoulders are passed than when the head is passed.\\n      \\n SHELDON LEAVITT, M.D., in closing the\\n      discussion, said: I have nothing of importance to add, though I might say\\n      a few words with regard to the use of the forceps as mentioned, more\\n      especially by Dr. Ripley. These short forceps-these very short forceps-are\\n      a convenience, to say the least. The use of emollients, as mentioned by\\n      Dr. Ripley, is an excellent practice; but we must give what Graves\\n      demanded-the tincture of time, in which the perinaeum may accommodate\\n      itself to the size of the foetal head. But the cases of which I spoke, in\\n      which episiotomy is desirable, are those in which we have given the time,\\n      and the vulvar opening is hard and unyielding, and the head out of\\n      proportion to it. Under these circumstances, where laceration is received,\\n      from the experience which we have had, we may introduce the scissors and\\n      make the incision to which I have alluded.', 'Thiamine (also spelled \"thiamin\") is a vitamin, formerly known as vitamin B1. Thiamine was one of the first compounds recognized as a vitamin.Thiamine is involved in many body functions, including nervous system and muscle function, the flow of electrolytes in and out of nerve and muscle cells, digestion, and carbohydrate metabolism. Very little thiamine is stored in the body and depletion can occur within 14 days. Severe thiamine deficiency may lead to serious complications involving the nervous system, brain, muscles, heart, and stomach and intestines.Dietary sources of thiamine include beef, brewer\\'s yeast, legumes (beans, lentils), milk, nuts, oats, oranges, pork, rice, seeds, wheat, whole-grain cereals, and yeast. In industrialized countries, food made with white rice or white flour is often enriched with thiamine.Thiamine is used as part of a treatment for metabolic disorders and thiamine deficiency symptoms, as well as in alcoholics. It has been studied for other uses, but conclusions are lacking at this time.', 'Tresorie - HAHNEMANN BI-CENTENNIAL CELEBRATION [Hahnemann Centennial\\nCelebration]\\n\\n The most notable functions in Calcutta\\n      was organised by the Bengal Homoeopathic Institute, 1B Old Post Office\\n      St., Cal. 1 and was held at Moslem Institute, 21A Wellesley Sq., Cal. 16\\n      on the 10h April 55 at 4 P.M. Dr. S.K. Das, B.SC., M.B. presided over the\\n      meeting; Sri U. Mukherji, I.P., Commissioner of Police, Calcutta,\\n      inaugurated the function; Justice P. Mullick, Calcutta High court was the\\n      Chief Guests; and Dr. W.S. Barlingay, PH.D. M.P., Ex-Health Minister,\\n      Madhya Pradesh was a distinguished visitor. About 400 persons attended the\\n      meeting.\\n      \\n The function started with garlanding a\\n      portrait of Hahnemann. Sri Upananda Mukherji, in his inaugural address,\\n      paid his respectful homage to the sacred memory of Hahnemann. He pointed\\n      out that the best way of showing respect to this illustrious personage is\\n      to carry the message of Homoeopathy to the farthest corners of our\\n      country. That Homoeopathy has established itself in our country and is\\n      brought to service of millions of suffering people, rich and poor,\\n      bespeaks of its therapeutic efficacy and immortalises Hahnemann as one of\\n      the greatest benefactors of mankind. He held that Homoeopathy is rich with\\n      immense potentialities; and intensive research works ought to be\\n      undertaken to enlarge its scope and sphere of applicability in the field\\n      of medicine in all its aspects.\\n      \\n In his address as the chief Guest,\\n      Justice Mullick deplored that under present circumstances the greatness of\\n      a man of nation is being commonly judged by militaristic achievements in\\n      the background of discovery of atomic weapons of destruction on an\\n      inconceivably mass scale. But the memory of the Savant whose birthday was\\n      being celebrated, is associated with attempts to alleviate the miseries of\\n      people through death, disease and incapacity. Service to humanity is one\\n      of the keynotes of Indian culture. As a great humanitarian Hahnemanns name\\n      is enshrined in the heart of India for all ages to come.\\n      \\n Dr. J. Ghose, M.A., PH D., F.N.I.\\n      welcomed the gathering and in an erudite speech dwelt on some aspects of\\n      Homoeopathy.\\n      \\n Dr. W.S. Barlingay, in a neat speech,\\n      dwelt at length about the fundamental tennets of Homoeopathy. He pointed\\n      out that Hahnemanns philosophy had many points common to our Indian\\n      philosophy, especially of the Vedantic school.\\n      \\n He is having a feeling that the time is\\n      ripe for the advent of an Avatar in Medicine who will synthesise different\\n      systems of medicine, current in our country.\\n      \\n Dr. S.K. Das, in his presidential\\n      address, presented the salient features in Hahnemanns personality and\\n      character. In delineating the life - story of Hahnemann he justified that\\n      Hahnemann was a genius and a saint amongst the physicians that the world\\n      has ever produced. Though a century and a half old, Homoeopathy has\\n      already encompassed the world and is going to occupy its rightful place in\\n      every country.\\n      \\n Dr. J.N. Majumdar gave a hearty vote of\\n      thanks to the President and others and envisaged a bright future for\\n      Homoeopathy.\\n      \\n The All India Homoeopathic convention.\\n      \\n On the occasion of the Hahnemann\\n      Bi-centennial Celebration the Bengal Homoeopathic Institute organised the\\n      All India Homoeopathic Convention which was held at Moslem Institute on\\n      the 11th April 55.\\n      \\n Dr. W.S. Barlingay presided over the\\n      Convention; and Dr. B.K. Sarkar, M.B., D.M.S. was the chairman of the\\n      Reception Committee.\\n      \\n DR. Barlingay, in his presidential\\n      address, expressed his regret that the Govt. of India had not given much\\n      of its mind to implementing the 7-point programme in respect of\\n      Homoeopathy which has been drawn up under the first Five - Year Plan by\\n      the Planning commission. He announced that to bring pressure upon the\\n      Govt. of India, an All India Society for the Advancement of Homoeopathy\\n      (the members consisting of 18 M.P.s and many supporters of Homoeopathy\\n      with Sri S.K. Patil of Bombay as Chairman) had also been set up. Its main\\n      efforts will be to raise sufficient funds to start a fully - equipped\\n      Degree - course Homoeopathic College - cum - Hospital on an All India\\n      basis.\\n      \\n He remarked that some dishonest dealers\\n      in Homoeopathic medicine and some narrow - minded people connected with\\n      Homoeopathy stood in the way of the spread of this system of medicine. The\\n      Homoeopathic profession should try to get rid of them. Those who loved\\n      Homoeopathy must come forward and unitedly move for its spread and for\\n      setting up an ideal Homoeopathic Institute. Experienced practitioners must\\n      also put their heads together and draw up a syllabus for Graduate course\\n      in Homoeopathy. He thanked Dr. J.N. Majumdar, a member of the Ad Hoc\\n      committee, who with the help of his colleagues prepared such a draft\\n      syllabus and has got it approved by the said committee of which the\\n      Director General of Health Services, Ministry of Health, Govt. of India,\\n      is the chairman. Good Homoeopathic Hospitals and efficient practitioners\\n      alone would be able to make Homoeopathy popular. Homoeopathy, it should be\\n      remembered, provided the cheapest medical treatment.\\n      \\n Dr. B.K. Sarkar, Chairman of the\\n      Reception Committee said that the establishment of fully - equipped\\n      Homoeopathic institutions (College - cum - Hospital) was an imperative\\n      necessity for enhancing the prestige of the Homoeopathic profession and\\n      for convincing the people about the therapeutic efficacy of this system of\\n      treatment. He said that one of the great obstacles in the way of the\\n      spread of Homoeopathy was the apathy and \"in many cases active\\n      antagonism\" of the Government, both at the centre and at least in\\n      some of the States. It was because the Medical Directorates were manned\\n      solely by Allopathic doctors. He held that the opposition to Homoeopathy\\n      was not wholly scientific but rather of commercial nature on the part of\\n      the drug - tradesmen. The public should also be educated in the matter of\\n      fundamentals of Homoeopathy. He urged the profession to shake off their\\n      indolence and complacence and to take up concrete constructive works in\\n      immediate future if they want to hold their own as a professional entity.\\n      \\n Several resolutions were moved from the\\n      chair and passed unanimously by the House.\\n      \\n Resolutions passed at the All Indian\\n      Homoeopathic Convention on 11-4-55.\\n      \\n 1. Resolved that this Homoeopathic\\n      convention requests the Central Government and those State Governments who\\n      have not yet recognised the Homoeopathic system of treatment by\\n      legislative enactments, to take immediate steps for passing relevant acts\\n      for the purpose of ensuring proper standardisation of Homoeopathic\\n      teaching, and for securing rights and privileges of Homoeopathic\\n      Practitioners equal to those which are, at present, enjoyed by the\\n      Allopathic Physicians; and as well as for granting adequate help from the\\n      Central and State Governments, Financial or otherwise, for the development\\n      and spread of Homoeopathy in our country.\\n      \\n 2. Resolved that this Homoeopathic\\n      convention requests the Central Government for immediate establishment of\\n      the Central Council of Homoeopathic Medicine by statutory Central Council\\n      of Homoeopathic Medicine by Statutory enactments which will function as a\\n      Central Co-ordinating body for taking decisions on all matter relating to\\n      teaching and practice of Homoeopathy on an All - India basis, the\\n      necessity for which has already been recommended by the Homoeopathic\\n      Enquiry Committee, Third Health Ministers Conference, Planning Commission\\n      and the Ad Hoc Committee set up by the Director General of Health\\n      Services, Ministry of Health, Government of India.\\n      \\n 3. Resolved that this convention\\n      requests the Central Government to establish at least one model\\n      Homoeopathic Medical College in India with a fully equipped and up - to -\\n      date Hospital attached therewith.\\n      \\n 4. Resolved that this convention\\n      requests the Central Government to incorporate Registered Homoeopathic\\n      Practitioners from all States in the Health Personnel Scheme to solve the\\n      problem of adequate supply of medical relief to the teeming masses of\\n      India especially in rural areas.\\n      \\n 5. Resolved that this convention\\n      requests the Central and State Governments to open Homoeopathic Health\\n      Centers and Homoeopathic Charitable Dispensaries in village and other\\n      suitable places, particularly in the community project; and to introduce\\n      Homoeopathic Health Assistants, Nurses and Homoeopathic Compounders\\n      Training Courses.\\n      \\n 6. Resolved that the Homoeopathic\\n      Practitioners registered in their respective State be utilised in the\\n      State Health Insurance Schemes.\\n      \\n 7. Resolved that this convention\\n      records hereby its most emphatic protest against the move of the Central\\n      Government of India to pass an enactment aimed at prohibiting the practice\\n      of medicine including Homoeopathic, Ayurvedic and Unani systems of\\n      medicines by persons who are not registered as Practitioners of any of\\n      these systems before adequate provings are made and put into effect for\\n      registering all the eligible practitioners of different systems of\\n      medicine in all the States of the Indian Union.']\n"
