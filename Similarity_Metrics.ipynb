      "Average 26 of 26 completed.[ 'Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is a water-soluble vitamin, which is needed by the body to form collagen in bones, cartilage, muscle, and blood vessels. Dietary sources of vitamin C include fruits and vegetables, particularly citrus fruits such as oranges.Severe deficiency of vitamin C causes scurvy. Although rare, scurvy results in severe symptoms and can cause death. People with scurvy are treated with vitamin C and should be under medical supervision.Many uses for vitamin C have been proposed, but evidence of benefit in scientific studies is lacking. In particular, research on asthma, cancer, and diabetes remains inconclusive, and a lack of benefit has been found for the prevention of cataracts or heart disease.The use of vitamin C in the prevention or treatment of colds remains controversial. Extensive research has been conducted. Overall, vitamin C lacked an effect on the development of colds and on cold symptoms. However, the duration of the cold shortened slightly. Notably, people living in extreme circumstances, including soldiers in the subarctic, skiers, and marathon runners, had a 50% decrease in the risk of developing a cold. This area merits additional research and may be of particular interest to athletes or people in the military.'\n",

Honey has been used for wounds, skin problems, and various diseases of the stomach and intestines.The antibacterial effects of honey are well-known. Research has been done on the role of honey in long-term wound management, as well as the treatment of ulcers, burns, Fournier's gangrene (a life-threatening bacterial infection), and diabetes. However, more high-quality studies are needed to make firm conclusions on the use of honey.\"\n",
      " 'Vitamin B12 is an essential water-soluble vitamin that is commonly found in a variety of foods, such as fish, shellfish, meat, eggs, and dairy products. Vitamin B12 is frequently used in combination with other B vitamins in a vitamin B complex formulation. Vitamin B12 is important in DNA synthesis. Vitamin B12 is bound to the protein in food. Acid in the stomach releases B12 from protein during digestion. Once released, B12 combines with a substance called intrinsic factor (IF) before it is absorbed into the bloodstream.The human body stores several years\\' worth of vitamin B12 in the liver, so low levels in the body are rare. Decreases in vitamin B12 levels are more common in the elderly, HIV-infected persons, and vegetarians. Inability to absorb vitamin B12 from the intestinal tract can cause a type of anemia called pernicious anemia. Fever and symptoms of \"excessive sweating\" have been reported with anemia due to low levels of vitamin B12; however, these are fixed with vitamin B12 treatment.'\n",

Tea tree oil is thought to have antiseptic properties and has been used to prevent and treat infections.Other traditional uses of tea tree oil include treatment of fungal infections (including fungal infections of the nails and athlete's foot), dental health, parasites, skin allergic reactions, and vaginal infections. In addition, there is evidence supporting tea tree oil use for acne; however, further research is needed.Tea tree oil should not be taken by mouth; there are reports of toxicity after consuming tea tree oil by mouth. When applied to the skin, tea tree oil is reported to be mildly irritating and has been associated with the development of an allergic skin reaction, which may limit its potential as an agent for the skin in some people.\"\n",
      " 'Melatonin is a hormone produced in the brain by the pineal gland from the amino acid tryptophan. The production and release of melatonin are stimulated by darkness and decreased by light, suggesting that melatonin is involved in circadian rhythm (the internal body clock) and regulation of diverse body functions. Levels of melatonin in the blood are highest prior to bedtime.The most common use of melatonin is to aid in sleep. The strongest evidence supporting the use of melatonin is for delayed sleep phase syndrome, insomnia in children and the elderly, jet lag, and sleep problems in people with behavioral, developmental, or mental disorders. The weakest evidence in support of melatonin is for work shift sleep disorder. Good evidence in support of melatonin for other uses is lacking.New drugs that block the effects of melatonin are being developed. These include BMS-214778 and luzindole, and they may have uses in various disorders.'\n",
      " 'Black cohosh is popular as an alternative to hormonal therapy in the treatment of menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes, mood disturbances, excessive sweating, palpitations, and vaginal dryness. Several studies have reported black cohosh may improve menopausal symptoms for up to one year, although the evidence is mixed.The mechanism of action of black cohosh remains unclear. Research suggests that there may be no direct effects on estrogen receptors, although this is an area of active controversy.Safety and efficacy beyond one year have not been proven. Reports suggest the safety of short-term use, including in women with menopausal symptoms for whom estrogen replacement therapy is not suggested. Nonetheless, caution is advised until better-quality safety data are available. There have been reports of liver damage and higher lead levels in the blood from black cohosh. Use of black cohosh in high-risk populations (such as in women with a history of breast cancer) should be under the supervision of a licensed healthcare professional.'\n",
      " 'Beta-carotene is a carotenoid. Carotenoids are red, orange, or yellow, fat-soluble compounds. These compounds are naturally present in many fruits, grains, oils, and vegetables. Alpha, beta, and gamma carotene are considered provitamins because they can be converted to active vitamin A.Commercially available beta-carotene is man-made or taken from palm oil, algae, or fungi. Beta-carotene is converted to retinol, which is essential for vision and growth.Studies in humans show that beta-carotene has promising use for oral leukoplakia (pre-cancerous mouth lesions) and for sunburn. However there was a lack of benefit for sun damaged skin, mole prevention, heart disease risk, infection with H. Pylori, cataract prevention, diabetes, and stroke.Research shows that beta-carotene increased the risk of bladder, lung, stomach, and prostate cancer. Also the general incidence of cancer in asbestos workers, smokers, or high risk individuals increased. Additionally, some research suggested increased risk of heart disease and death with beta-carotene supplementation.'\n",
      " 'L-arginine was first isolated in 1886, reportedly from the extract of a lupine (Lupinus spp.) seedling. Lupinus is a genus in the legume (Fabaceae) plant family.Arginine is an amino acid normally made by the body. Arginine is also found in many foods that have protein.Arginine becomes nitric oxide (a blood vessel-widening agent called a vasodilator) in the body. Early evidence suggests that arginine may help treat medical conditions that improve with increased vasodilation. These conditions include chest pain, atherosclerosis (clogged arteries), heart disease, heart failure, erectile dysfunction, peripheral vascular disease, and headaches from blood vessel swelling).Arginine also triggers the body to make protein and has been studied for healing wounds, bodybuilding, enhancing sperm production, and preventing tissue wasting in people with critical illnesses. However, caution is warranted. Arginine use was associated with death in some people with heart conditions. Caution is also needed when using arginine to treat pre-eclampsia (high blood pressure in pregnancy).Arginine hydrochloride has been used to treat metabolic alkalosis. This use should be under the supervision of a qualified healthcare professional.'\n",

The lignan components of flaxseed (not flaxseed oil) may possess antioxidant properties and alter estrogen activity.As a source of fiber, flaxseed (not flaxseed oil) has laxative properties. In large doses, or when taken without enough water, flaxseed may cause bowel obstruction. The effects of flaxseed on blood sugar levels are unclear.Flaxseed oil contains only the ALA component of flaxseed and not the fiber or lignan components.

      " 'Tresorie - The Present Status of Radiation in the Treatment of Malignant\\nConditions [Present Status Of Radiation in the Treatment Of Malignant\\nConditions]\\n ISIDORE ARONS, M.D.\\n      \\n New York, N.Y.\\n      \\n AT A meeting of the American Medical\\n      Association recently held in Cleveland, Dr. Joseph C.Bloodgood, in\\n      discussing a paper on radiation therapy, said that \"report at my\\n      clinic told me that 49 per cent of the patients previously operated on in\\n      the clinic now to for radiotherapy. This is based on results. They are not\\n      hopeless cases; they are still hopeful and they get well under\\n      radiotherapy. This has happened during the last three years, not because I\\n      have changed any but because the method of radiotherapy has changed. A\\n      great change has taken place. First of all, radium and x-rays are no\\n      longer looked on a last resort.\".\\n      \\n The foregoing bears witness to the\\n      progress made in the field radiation therapy. The manufacture of more\\n      adequate apparatus and the improved technic in its use reflect this\\n      improvement. Machines are used generally delivering twenty to thirty\\n      milliamperes of current at 200 K.V., while machines operating at 750 to\\n      1,000 200 K.V., using lower milliamperes, have been installed in several\\n      places in this country. Since the question of increased voltages began to\\n      dominate the field, machines operating at 400 to 600 K.V., using sealed\\n      tubes, have been manufactured in this country as well as on the been\\n      manufactured in this country as well as on the continent. This higher\\n      powered machines occupy little more space than the usual 200 K.V. machine.\\n      \\n The effectiveness of these stronger\\n      radiations is thought to be due to (1) the increased penetration and its\\n      consequently larger percentage depth doses, (2) the supposed higher\\n      selective action of short have length radiation on malignant cells, and\\n      (3) greatly increased x-ray output. Clinics using super-voltages report\\n      that clinical results are somewhat better than those secured through the\\n      use of the lesser voltage machine.\\n      \\n Experimental effort, from the physical\\n      and biologic point of view, has been exerted to establish to standard\\n      basis for radiotherapy since Roentgens discovery thirtyfive years ago, and\\n      its application five years later. Radiotherapists have only recently begun\\n      to understand the principles of clinical application or radiotherapy in\\n      the treatment of malignant conditions.\\n      \\n Regaud selected the rabbits testicle\\n      for his experiments because its histologic cellular structure was highly\\n      sensitive to radiation, containing cells which are in a state of active\\n      mitosis resembling that of malignant tissue. In 1922, Regaud reported that\\n      of malignant, tissue. In 1922, Regaud reported that it was impossible to\\n      sterilize the testicle by a single dose of radiation without causing\\n      serious damage to the overlying skin. The dose required to produced such\\n      radio necrosis was equivalent to about three radionecrosis was equivalent\\n      to about three erythemas when administered in one dose. However, by\\n      dividing the dose in such a manner as to prolong the treatment over a\\n      period of fourteen days, a total dose of about five erythemas could be\\n      given causing complete sterilizations without damage to the skin. Thus it\\n      is seen that by prolonging the time of treatment the cutaneous dose could\\n      be increased nearly 50 per cent without causing necrosis.\\n      \\n The above experiments were reported,\\n      and the same results determined, by Schinz and Slotopolsky in 1926, and\\n      again by Regaud and Ferroux in 1927. These experiments formed the\\n      foundation for the clinical studies of Pfahler (America), Hohlfelder\\n      (Germany) and Coutard (France), who have swung the pendulum from massive\\n      radiation, as advocated by the German school, to that of the protected\\n      fractional dose method. Results have been achieved by this method which\\n      are superior to previously reported; these are obtained by the improved\\n      method of administering a large dose to the (3 days) without causing\\n      destructive effects to the surroundings normal structure (or cancer bed);\\n      its effect are rather biologic than physical. The clinical application of\\n      the method of radiation by Pfahler, Countard, and Berven (Sweden) in the\\n      treatment of cancer of the tonsil, pharynx and larynx and have proved the\\n      radio-sensitive properties of squamous carcinoma, previously considered\\n      incapable of of responding to radiation.\\n      \\n According to Coutard, the neoplasm is\\n      exposed to x-rays twice daily, giving a total dose of 350 r to400 r to two\\n      areas, using 190 to 200 k.v., four milliamperes, two millimeters of copper\\n      and three millimeters of aluminum filtration at a distance of fifty of\\n      sixty centimeters, for lesion of the head and neck. For deeply situated\\n      lesions, such as cancer of the uterus, the focal distance varies from 80\\n      to 100 centimeters, the area of the field for the head and neck conditions\\n      being only 50 to 100 square centimeters, while those of the lower abdomen\\n      require on an average of 250 to 300 square centimeters. For the\\n      sterilization of the radio-sensitive squamous carcinomatous growth, a\\n      depth dose of 3,000 r to 4,000 r is given, while stronger dose is\\n      necessary for the radio-resistant tumors.\\n      \\n In the course of treatment of principle\\n      guides a radio reaction of the covering epithelium and the radio reaction\\n      of the cancer cells. The radio reaction of the cutaneous epithelium is\\n      called \"radio epidermitis.\"characterized by loss of epithelial\\n      layers and denudation of the dermis. The reaction of the mucous membrane ,\\n      called \"radio epithelitis,\" manifests itself by loss of the\\n      epithelial layer sand denudation of the mucous membrane, epithelial layers\\n      and denudation of the corium which becomes covered by a fibrinous and\\n      false membrane; of clear. The duration of both describe radio reactions is\\n      six weeks. Each appears at the beginning of three weeks and disappears at\\n      the beginning of the ninth week.\\n      \\n Should the total or daily dose or the\\n      intensity per minute be too high, or the filtration or the tension too\\n      low, the cancer bed would be modified. the nutrition of the malignant\\n      cells becomes impaired The cellular radio- sensitivity, which seems to be\\n      linked up not only with the mitosis of the cell but above all with the\\n      activity of their interchange with the cell but above all with the\\n      activity of their interchange with the surrounding normal structures,\\n      becomes diminished and at times suppressed. The cancer cells become\\n      incentive to radiation. This phenomenon is called \"radio-\\n      vaccination\" by Regaud.\\n      \\n Observation of clinical facts shows\\n      that changes in the surrounding normal tissue result from excessive daily\\n      doses and intensity per minute per minute causing radio resistance of the\\n      tissue. Conversely, radio- sensitivity would be prolonged with a smaller\\n      daily dosage and the resultant extended period.\\n      \\n Realizing that better results may be\\n      obtained by prolonged treatment, Coutard and his collaborators in the last\\n      few years have begun to extend the duration of treatment of certain\\n      so-called radio-resistant cancers from thirty to ninety days, giving weak\\n      daily doses in order of about 175, 220, 225 and 250 r per day, dividing\\n      the dose in two treatments. By this method he was able to cure a certain\\n      number of lesions on which he had not been able previously to obtain the\\n      same results, such as very differentiated epidermoid epithelioma invading\\n      the muscles and cartilages, glandular epithelioma of the breast ad the\\n      thyroid body, and special round celled epitheliomas of the upper part of\\n      the ethmoid and the adjacent sinuses. This mode of prolonged treatment not\\n      only controlled the condition locally but it lessened the frequency of\\n      metastasis.\\n      \\n When radiating a cancer of very\\n      embryonic, very radio-sensitive growths, the energy factor is predominant.\\n      The action of the x-rays seems to be direct and rapid; the treatment can\\n      be accomplished within fifteen to twenty days. The cells are destroyed and\\n      generally normal structures are affected very little. When radiating the\\n      less embryonic type of growths, the time of treatment should be longer.\\n      \\n Pursuing these general principles, I\\n      have adopted the Countard method with some slight modifications. The cures\\n      which I shall illustrate will show that the percentage of cures in a\\n      number of most dangerous epidermoid carcinomas has markedly increased and\\n      that some conditions formerly considered hopeless have been temporarily\\n      cured. In conclusion I wish to emphasize the following facts:.\\n      \\n (1) Cure of cancer by x-rays is still\\n      difficult and must not be entered into lightly and causally.\\n      \\n (2) Radiotherapy is just as radical in\\n      method as surgery, and requires great skill, judgment and experience.\\n      \\n (3) The cooperation of the pathologist\\n      and the radiotherapist is imperative for a proper estimate of the\\n      radio-sensitivity in relation to treatment of the lesion.\\n      \\n (4) Daily examination of the patient is\\n      necessary; modification of the normal structure and general reaction by\\n      the x-ray treatment sometimes appears to quickly that it is often\\n      necessary to diminish the daily dose or the size of the field in the\\n      course of treatment.\\n      \\n (5) There exists no fixed method of\\n      treatment, only a simple clinical treatment for each individual patient\\n      and for the special type of tumor..\\n      \\n (6) Improvement in roentgen apparatus\\n      of higher voltages, producing more penetrating rays, will permit a better\\n      relation between destruction of malignant cells and preservation of the\\n      supporting, and the radio sensitivity of the tumor may be prolonged.'\n",

This is the city where\\n      Homoeopathy was first introduced by Rajendra Lal Dutta of hallowed memory,\\n      who spent a princely fortune for dissemination of its principles and\\n      practice among his countrymen. This is the city where took place the\\n      dramatic conversion of one of the then medical luminaries of the first\\n      magnitude, to the practice of Homoeopathy under the influence of Rajendra\\n      Lal. I mean Dr. Mahendra Lal Sircar who became the high priest of\\n      Homoeopathy, spread its glory far and wide and gained thereby an\\n      international reputation for himself. This is the city where the\\n      celebrities of Homoeopathy like Dr. Berigny, Dr. Salzar, Dr. P.C.\\n      Majumdar, Dr. D. N. Roy. Dr. Younan, Dr. J.N. Majumdar, Dr. Baridbaran\\n      Mukherji, Dr. S.K. Nag, Dr. A.N. Mukherji, Dr. T.N. Palit, Dr. G.\\n      Dirghangi and a host of other talented physicians practised their\\n      profession with credit and success and held aloft the banner of\\n      Homoeopathy. This is the city where exist pioneer institutions for the\\n      teaching of Homoeopathy. This is the city wherefrom Homoeopathy has spread\\n      to all parts of India and its votaries are doing yeomans service for the\\n      good of the suffering humanity.\\n      \\n We are meeting this evening on a\\n      historic occasion and we have to arrive at decisions which might make or\\n      mar the future history of Homoeopathy in India. It may be that forces of\\n      disruption, destruction and obstruction are at work; it may be that self\\n      and vested interests seem to thwart the smooth progress of Homoeopathy; it\\n      may be that some may seem to play in the hands of the Powers that are not\\n      too sympathetic to the cause of Homoeopathy; it may be that the present\\n      seems to be chaotic and future of Homoeopathy dubious but great is truth\\n      indeed and will prevail. We should not lose heart or throw up the sponge.\\n      Tradition, authority, sectarianism, dogmatism are great obstacles on the\\n      way. But obstacles and difficulties are meant to be fought out and\\n      overcome. Strifes and dissensions, discords and disunities may hamper our\\n      progress but they are nonetheless signs of lifes activities. It is a good\\n      augury that the Homoeopathic profession is shaking off its age - long\\n      slumber and getting more and more conscious of its duties and obligation,\\n      its rights and privileges and of its short - comings and practical\\n      difficulties. The life of Hahnemann is there to encourage us; the\\n      masterful will of his dynamic spirit is there to inspire us to intensify\\n      our activities; his achievements are there to goad us to realise greater\\n      success; and his personality is always before us to take lessons from, in\\n      our life which as Swami Vivekananda puts it, is \"a process of\\n      unfolding and development of a being under circumstances tending to press\\n      it down.\"\\n      \\n That Homoeopathy is a scientific system\\n      of treatment, philosophically sound, logically unimpeachable, practically\\n      highly efficacious in curing the sick and cheap enough to suit the poor\\n      economic condition of the Indian masses - has become a much talked - of\\n      subject in the country. But why is it not spreading sufficiently and\\n      adequately in our motherland or in fact anywhere in the world? Why is our\\n      National Government not still keen on according official recognition to\\n      this superb system of healing art or providing ways and means for its\\n      development and diffusion? Why the public opinion is not gaining strength\\n      enough to put sufficient pressure on our Government to take interest in\\n      it? Why sufficient number of fully equipped Homoeopathic teaching\\n      institutions and hospitals are not growing to turn out adequate number of\\n      fully qualified Homoeopathic physicians in the country?\\n      \\n It is high time that we should draw the\\n      attention of the profession and the laity to provide answers to so many\\n      \"whys\" and to solve the pressing problems in the matter\\n      concerned. On a cursory view it becomes evident that the Homoeopathic\\n      profession, the people and the Government are each individually and\\n      collectively responsible for this impasse.\\n      \\n The so - called Allopathy still\\n      occupies the dominant place in any country, even in the land of birth of\\n      Homoeopathy. It is no wonder that Homoeopathy, being a discovery of merely\\n      a century and a half still lags behind its rival shool. But it is a wonder\\n      of wonders that Homoeopathy has already encompassed the whole world within\\n      such a short period since it was ushered into existence by Hahnemann.\\n      History of man reveals that nowhere a new truth was accepted by him easily\\n      and readily, obsessed as he is with conservatism, tradition, authority and\\n      vested interests. Nonetheless the triumphant march of Homoeopathy with a\\n      such a meteoric speed throughout the length and breadth of the world is a\\n      proof positive of the truth inherent in the system and phenomenal\\n      therapeutic efficacy of this healing art. It is one more glaring instance\\n      of mans love of truth against heavy odds that impede his progress at every\\n      step.\\n      \\n For the propagation of any new truth\\n      and its acceptance by man, in general, the first and foremost condition is\\n      the turning out of sufficient number of persons who have realised the\\n      truth and are adept in the practice of it. This involves establishment of\\n      a sufficient number of teaching institutions which will turn out experts\\n      in the science and art of Homoeopathy; and a sufficient number of\\n      Homoeopathic Hospital where, the efficacy of this system of treatment will\\n      be put to test.\\n      \\n Human knowledge is becoming\\n      unmanageably vast. The appearance of specialists has become indispensable.\\n      So special Hospitals for the treatment of specific types of diseases have\\n      sprung forth elsewhere, e.g. Tuberculosis Hospitals, Cancer Hospitals,\\n      Hospital for Tropical Diseases etc. Because of organisation of these\\n      hospitals people generally think of getting themselves treated in these\\n      institutions. As there are no fully - equipped general Homoeopathic\\n      Hospitals and not to speak of special Homoeopathic Hospitals and not to\\n      speak of special Homoeopathic Hospitals the result is Homoeopathy is not\\n      getting a fair chance of treating those diseases like tuberculosis,\\n      cancer, acute infectious diseases of epidemic type e.g., Small-pox,\\n      Cholera etc. on a large and organised scale. Consequently the general\\n      public cannot keep much faith in this treatment and mostly take recourse\\n      to homoeopathic treatment when the case is \"past all hope and past\\n      all surgery\". Hence the establishment of fully - equipped\\n      Homoeopathic institutions (College - cum - Hospitals) is an imperative\\n      necessity for enhancing the prestige of the Homoeopathic profession and\\n      for convincing the people about the therapeutic efficacy of this system of\\n      treatment. Is it not a pity that Homoeopathy once established its\\n      reputation by treating Cholera cases in this city and now nobody thinks of\\n      this treatment in Cholera cases and rushes the patient to the Allopathic\\n      Hospitals which are especially meant for these types of patients? How can\\n      we hope to gain ground under these circumstances?\\n      \\n The next great obstacle is the apathy\\n      and in many cases active antagonism of our Government, both at the Centre\\n      and at least in some of the State, towards Homoeopathy. The Government is\\n      under the thumb of its medical directorates which are solely manned by\\n      Allopathic doctors. The main reasons for the non - acceptance of the\\n      Homoeopathic system of treatment may be summed up in three words:\\n      tradition, authority and professionalism. Their psychology is easily\\n      understood if it is borne in mind that the conservative inertia of human\\n      mind attempts to reject any new thought will all the means at its\\n      disposal. Another reason is due to vested interests. Even a cursory glance\\n      at the history of origin and spread of Homoeopathy, enables one to find\\n      out that the opposition to this system from the start, was not scientific\\n      but rather of commercial nature on the part of the apothecaries who were\\n      afraid of losing their trade - profits. We regret to note that the Central\\n      Government have not yet implemented a single recommendation put forward by\\n      the Homoeopathic Enquiry Committee, Planning Commission. Third Health\\n      Ministers Conference, Ad Hoc Committee etc. though Homoeopathic Acts have\\n      been passed in the States of Bombay, U.P., Madhya Pradesh, Travancore -\\n      Cochin, Bihar etc. I is curious to note that W. Bengal is the only State\\n      where a Homoeopathic Bill has recently been thrown out by the State\\n      Government.\\n      \\n Another great obstacle is the\\n      psychology of the general mass of population who fail to adopt a proper\\n      philosophical attitude towards Homoeopathy and takes the Homoeopathic\\n      Therapeutic Law as great paradox contrary to common sense. Unless we can\\n      educate the public in the matter, we cannot hope to secure their whole -\\n      hearted support for this system of treatment.\\n      \\n Lack of enthusiasm for constructive\\n      works on the part of the Homoeopathic profession, the apathy of our\\n      Government and hesitancy on the part of the public to accept Homoeopathy\\n      are great obstacles to the spread of this system of treatment in the\\n      country. Unless this vicious circles is broken the progress of Homoeopathy\\n      is bound to be impeded. We have to fight on all fronts if we aspire to\\n      achieve victory in our battle for the cause of Homoeopathy and the\\n      suffering humanity.\\n      \\n But our first necessity as pointed out\\n      by the Soul of India expressing itself through Sri Aurobindo, is: If India\\n      is to survive and do her appointed work in the world, the youth of India\\n      should learn to think, to think on all subjects, to think independently,\\n      fruitfully, going to the heart of things, not stopped by their surface,\\n      free of pre - judgements, shearing sophism and prejudice asunder as with a\\n      sharp sword smiting down obscurantism of all kinds as with a mace of\\n      Bhima.\\n      \\n \"Let our brains no longer, like\\n      European infants, be swathed with swaddling clothes; let it have recover\\n      the free and unbound motion of the Gods, let it have not only the\\n      minuteness but the wide mastery and sovereignty natural to the intellect\\n      of Bharata and easily recoverable by it if it once accustomes itself to\\n      feel its own power and be convinced of its own worth.\\n      \\n \"The old fixed foundations have\\n      been broken up, we are tossing in the waters of a great upheaval and\\n      change. It is no use clinging to the old ice - floes of the past, they\\n      will soon melt and leave their refugees struggling in perilous waters. It\\n      is no use landing ourselves in the infirm bog, neither sea nor good, dry\\n      land of a second - hand Europeanism. We shall only die there a miserable\\n      and unclean death.\\n      \\n \"No we must learn to swim and use\\n      that power to reach the good vessel of unchanging truth; we must land\\n      again on the eternal rock of ages.\"\\n      \\n Yes, we must expand, we must assimilate\\n      whatever is assimilable for our growth. Stagnation and contraction are the\\n      signs of Death. Our knowledge must be aggressive, must diffuse through the\\n      rank and file of the whole Homoeopathic profession if we wish to survive\\n      and perpetuate ourselves; to leave an extensive ignorance either below or\\n      around us is to expose ourselves to the perpetual danger of being\\n      exterminated as a professional entity.\\n      \\n In fine, I welcome you, once again, on\\n      this historic occasion to this historic city to deliberate, to exchange\\n      view points and to come to agreed decisions with regard to our future line\\n      of action in respect of Homoeopathy in all its aspects.'\n",
      " 'Tresorie - SOME OBSERVATIONS ON NEURASTHENIA AND ITS TREATMENT\\n[Neurasthenia & Treatment]\\n\\n WHEN, thirty-five years ago, the writer\\n      first made the acquaintance of what is now called neurasthenia, it was\\n      known as spinal irritation, and the best of modern researches have been\\n      unable to give a better definition beyond a functional disturbance of the\\n      spinal and cerebral nerves, dependent on a morbid process, for which\\n      \"irritation\" is as proper a term as any. As deaths do not occur,\\n      autopsies throw no light on the subject. Briefly stated, neurasthenia,\\n      when observed from the beginning through its chronic course, has a period\\n      of prodromal symptoms followed by a protracted acute, and succeeded by a\\n      still more protracted chronic, state, between the end of which and the\\n      beginning of convalescence there is a very vague, often indiscernible,\\n      boundary line.\\n      \\n The prodromal symptoms are quite\\n      indefinite and very variable, pointing to nothing in particular. Loss of\\n      appetite, irregular sleep, excitability alternating with lassitude, etc.,\\n      are often overlooked, especially when the second stage-display of unusual\\n      mental and physical energy without subsequent fatigue- becomes apparent.\\n      This is often mistaken for a sign of unusually good health. When a young\\n      girl or mature woman, married or unmarried, feels that she can study ten\\n      hours a day and devote half of her night to pleasure or business; when\\n      besides much mental occupation she begins to rejoice in long walks without\\n      fatigue, that is the time when the mischief is going on without exciting\\n      timely suspicion. Relief is at last sought when the functional disorder of\\n      the nerves has gone to the opposite extreme, and becomes manifest in what\\n      is properly and popularly termed \"nervous prostration,\" when\\n      instead of having no sense of fatigue, the best bodily or mental effort\\n      seems intolerable, in grave cases rendering the patient a helpless being,\\n      completely dependent on the unremitting assistance of others whom she )it\\n      is usually a woman) rules with the inexorable power of the vis inertiae.\\n      \\n During this usually very protracted\\n      period of the disease convalescence usually sets in, but so imperceptibly\\n      that the physician alone can sometimes estimate its progress, which is\\n      unnoticeable to others towards whom the patient acts as she has for months\\n      or years. This is the time for action, too often delayed from motives of\\n      misplaced sympathy on the part of relatives and friends.\\n      \\n The affections is in many instances\\n      limited to the spine, the mind becoming only secondarily tired. In other\\n      cases it is spinal and cerebral; in others again chiefly cerebral. The\\n      line between this and insanity is always clearly definable. Though a\\n      neurasthenic patient may become insane, and probably the reverse, yet both\\n      are distinct conditions.\\n      \\n Books speak of this disease at common\\n      to men and women. Yet in this region in small towns as well as in large\\n      cities the cases of neurasthenia in women are preponderatingly great.\\n      \\n Hypochondriacs and hysteria stand in\\n      peculiar relation to neurasthenia. They maybe regarded as different\\n      species of the same genus; that is, more or less deeply seated\\n      disturbances of the cerebro-spinal system in which the sympathetic system\\n      is probably indirectly involved, as many functional disturbances presided\\n      over by the great sympathetic system often testify. Hypochondriasis, pure\\n      and simple as occurring in men, is easily distinguishable by its striking\\n      characteristic of introspection and despondency, occasioned by abnormal\\n      sensations, without marked physical weakness and tiredness. Pure\\n      hypochondriacs are often energetic, conscientious workers. In hysteria\\n      there is neither great tiredness nor tendency to introspection, but a\\n      paroxysmal or prolonged absence of the power of self control, in grave\\n      cases associated with tonic or clonic muscular spasm and loss of\\n      consciousness. While neurasthenia in its uncomplicated forms is free from\\n      these symptoms, but, as ample experience teaches, often complicated with\\n      both of the preceding forms to such an extent that it is often very\\n      difficult to tell which is primary and which secondary. The symptoms known\\n      as introspection, hysterical aberrations of the emotions, and neurasthenic\\n      sense of exhaustion are in their distinctive manifestations most important\\n      and constitute indications in the selection of remedial and dietetic\\n      measures.\\n      \\n The following are some observation of\\n      peculiarities observed in a large number of cases and peculiar to all:.\\n      \\n Introspection.-The neurasthenic patient\\n      in variably expresses her desire for relief, not so much in a direct\\n      appeal as in a supplicating, subdued tone of voice and manner. She rarely\\n      asks, \"What can you do to relieve me?\" but almost invariably,\\n      \"What is the cause of\" this or that sensation? If she is\\n      introspective, that is, hypochondriacal, she becomes a nosomaniac,\\n      watching acutely every one of her numerous distressing sensation, on the\\n      unremitting analysis of which her mind dwells. In marked cases she is\\n      quite unable to think of anything outside of herself, and in many cases\\n      dislikes to do so, preferring to river her attention on herself. Attempts\\n      to divert her annoy or anger her. Friends and relatives implore the\\n      physician to divert the patient, but all their attempts are in vain\\n      because quite misdirected.\\n      \\n Positive and Negative Will.-It seems\\n      sometimes as if the patient delights in her self-inspection, and that she\\n      prefers her condition to speedy recovery. This is not the case, for the\\n      patient will always assure the physician of her wish to get well. During\\n      the acute stage-a long yet definable period-this wish and longing cannot\\n      well be utilized, but the long and ill-defined period of convalescence\\n      must first be awaited. Here we shall always discover that the wish and the\\n      will of the patient are two very different mental conditions. The desire\\n      or wish for recovery is entirely unattended by any will effort to\\n      accomplish the desired end. The injunctions and directions of the\\n      physician are resisted by the same unconquerable power of negative power,\\n      or vis inertiae. The patient having been unable to exert her will, now\\n      thinks herself unable to use it.\\n      \\n Numerous Symptoms of Patients.-To\\n      physicians in search of indications for medicines each statement of\\n      patient concerning a sensation is apt to be considered as a symptom. Many\\n      years ago, when resolved to get at the keynote of a patient\\'s case, the\\n      writer determined to allow the patient to detail all her symptoms as long\\n      as she chose and to take accurate notes of each one till the right one\\n      should be disclosed; and this was to be done regardless of time and\\n      exertion. The patient, one who needed no urging to describe her\\n      \"symptoms,\" began in an almost inaudible voice, detailing one\\n      sensation after another with an unrivalled degree of clearness and\\n      vividness of expression; as she proceeded the voice became stronger, her\\n      face slightly flushed, and the most perfect descriptive language flowed in\\n      an endless stream. Each word was written down, page after page was filled;\\n      still she went on with unmistakable signs of satisfaction at being able to\\n      pour her pent-up emotions into willing and sympathetic ears. If, for a\\n      moment, the flow of language was interrupted, a simple question would\\n      re-animate her to proceed with renewed energy. Feelings seemed to beget\\n      feelings; their complexity gave the patient no trouble; her intellect was\\n      equal to the action of unraveling the most complicated sensation,\\n      separating them into their component parts and spreading them out before\\n      the mind of the listener. A glance at the watch showed that nearly two\\n      hours had passed, during which the feeblest of neurasthenic patients had\\n      talked incessantly. The note-book was full, the keynote was found. It was\\n      this: neurasthenic patients have innumerable sensation and exhibit no\\n      sings of fatigue after talking incessantly for nearly two hours.\\n      \\n Great Endurance of Neurasthenics.-The\\n      instance just related, which is one of many, illustrates two things. One\\n      is, that it is not the kind of sensation described but the fact that\\n      neurasthenics have innumerable sensations, that constitute the symptoms.\\n      The other thing is that many neurasthenics are capable of great exertion\\n      without suffering disagreeable after- effects from fatigue. This is\\n      illustrated by other cases of which I have notes. A highly neurasthenic\\n      young lady consented to camp out for her health near a lake. She was\\n      induced to join a party for a short walk along the lake. By trying what\\n      they thought a shorter road the party lost their way and took a very long\\n      walk of about four hours, through bogs and over forces. The neurasthenic\\n      was less fatigued than some of the others. The interesting observation was\\n      subsequently made that the patient had become interested in a young man of\\n      the party. She recovered her health within a year from that time. Other\\n      cases of this kind will appear under the head of therapeutic suggestions.\\n      \\n Neurasthenic Patients Crave\\n      Sympathy.-This is one of the most formidable obstacles to the curative\\n      management of such cases, for the kind of sympathy such patients crave is\\n      expressions of condolence and more or less deep affliction at so much\\n      suffering as the patient expresses. Such sympathy is most natural and does\\n      honor to the feelings of parents, sisters, brothers and husbands, but it\\n      is unfortunate that the deeper their expression of affliction so much the\\n      more profound will be the mental dejection and weakness of the patient.\\n      Almost every case which has come under the writer\\'s observation has been\\n      much hampered if not made hopeless by this condition of things, against\\n      which no remedy suggests itself that would not be construed as\\n      \"unkind\".\\n      \\n The origin of this very formidable and\\n      refractory nervous disease, like that of most diseases usually termed\\n      chronic, is either hereditary or acquired, as the histories of every\\n      observed case plainly testify. Either the father was a hypochondriac or\\n      the mother neurasthenic, or both parents were of unsound nervous\\n      constitution. Dipsomania on the part of parents produces neurasthenia in\\n      the children, as readily as it will be followed by any other form of\\n      nervous disease, according to the individual predisposition of the\\n      offspring. The excessive use of tea and coffee is another very active\\n      factor in the history of neurasthenics. Where fathers inclined to alcohol,\\n      mothers are addicted to tea and coffee, which, while its immediate effects\\n      do not obtrude themselves upon our notice, are none the less insidious in\\n      their more remote consequences.\\n      \\n The acquired forms of neurasthenia are\\n      of utmost interest to the therapeutist, and the sources of acquisition are\\n      readily stated. They are much brain-work with insufficient food and sleep.\\n      Such conditions obtain chiefly in women (less frequently in men) of fine\\n      intellectual ability, conscientiousness and ambition. Physical overwork\\n      with unintellectual women has no such effect. Quite analogous to the above\\n      are the conditions of care and sorrow, especially in women who are able\\n      for a long time to conceal and control their emotions. The usual\\n      consequence of such states of mind is disregard of food and insufficient\\n      sleep. Instances of acquired neurasthenia are presented in families of\\n      several girls and boys, where one or more of the former are Neurasthenic\\n      while the latter are vigorous and athletic. Boys delighting in vigorous\\n      exercise do not, as is the case with girls, lose appetite and sleep.\\n      \\n The effects of nervous exhaustion in\\n      boys are usually much less grave than in girls; as a rule such effects are\\n      manifested in mental, not muscular, tiredness, and they are relieved by\\n      air and exercise, while in girls and women those influences are shunned\\n      because they seem to increase the tiredness.\\n      \\n Predisposition-The temperament, or what\\n      in modern pharaseology is called the personal equation, plays a visible\\n      but uncontrollable part in the progress of neurasthenia, as temperament\\n      greatly determines the other imperfectly known condition known as\\n      predisposition. Where the disease is hereditary, it is easy to say that\\n      the predisposition is due to that source; where there is no history of\\n      heredity and where neurasthenia exists in the last members of a\\n      generation, it may be attributed to acquired predisposition which needed\\n      only the exciting cause to establish the disease in its most typical form.\\n      \\n One of the most common forms of\\n      neurasthenia, often quite intractable, results from a serious defect in\\n      our public school system, one which affects chiefly girls from twelve to\\n      fourteen years of age. The following is a brief example: The child rises\\n      late with no appetite for breakfast and no time to eat it if so inclined.\\n      The lessons, however, have been learned the evening before, and the school\\n      work is begun with an ambitions will and a crammed mind, and continues\\n      with one intermission of often not more than ten minutes or three of four\\n      hours. The pupil arrives at home ravenously hungry, eats too fast, and too\\n      much of injudiciously prepared food, too long in digesting to leave room\\n      for an appetite for even a light evening meal, or even for a breakfast the\\n      next morning.\\n      \\n In another case the girl or boy grows\\n      desperately hungry while at school, but being unprovided with food\\n      (lunch), goes on with the school exercises, at the end of which the sense\\n      of hunger has vanished and has been replaced by an aversion to normal\\n      food, with a possible craving for something pungent and indigestible. This\\n      observation can easily be made in many instances, and will, in as many\\n      cases, be seen to lead to nervous prostration, which is then treated by\\n      vile, patented concoctions consisting largely of whiskey, under the name\\n      of \"tonics,\" while the patient needs only the best that a\\n      legitimate market affords prepared in a sensible manner.\\n      \\n Typical Cases Ending in Rapid\\n      Recovery.-Curative results have already been indicated in what has been\\n      said above, and further indications for treatment may be gathered from a\\n      few cases of extremely rapid recovery of apparently incurable cases, to\\n      which brief allusion will here be made. A woman of forty had been a victim\\n      of grave neurasthenia for five years. In the absence of an inclination to\\n      exert himself, she had, during that period, been mostly confined to her\\n      bed or lounge, in the meantime giving birth to two children, going through\\n      gestation and confinement normally, without recovering from neurasthenic\\n      prostration which, in the course of some years more, rendered her entirely\\n      helpless. Her condition was associated with a feeling of dropping to\\n      pieces unless supported and braced by a harness of wood, iron and leather,\\n      in which she \"sat up\" for several hours each day, spending the\\n      rest of the time in bed. Having left the patient in this condition, it was\\n      reported before the writer\\'s next professional visit that Mrs.-had been\\n      cured, and that she was able to go out like other people. A visit to the\\n      house confirmed the report. The patient came to the door herself, and in a\\n      quiet manner, entirely without the least expression of joy or wonder at\\n      her release, stated, that having heard of a famous \"magnetic\\n      physician,\" she summoned him, was ordered by him to arise and stand;\\n      protesting that it was impossible, she was raised to her feet and again\\n      ordered to stand, then to walk. Fearing that she would fall, she begged\\n      the magnetic doctor to support her, which he peremptorily refused, saying\\n      she might fall if she liked. Instead of falling, she had to walk about the\\n      room, was then placed upon a lounge and subjected to a severe treatment of\\n      rolling and pummelling, and then ordered to dress and sit up until tired,\\n      to remain up and about like other people, and to call on the doctor in\\n      future, as he would not come so far to the patient again. This happened\\n      about twenty-five years ago, and the patient has been in very fair health\\n      arrested by insisting that all professional visits by the writer or any\\n      other physician to whose sympathy the patient could appeal must cease.\\n      This injunction was carried out conscientiously with the best results by\\n      the husband of the patient. Perhaps we may learn from this that sometimes,\\n      at least, the familiar motto is reversed, and angels rush in where fools\\n      fear to tread.\\n      \\n Profiting by this experience, another\\n      neurasthenic woman, unmarried, but of most intractable, antagonistic\\n      temperament, confined to her bed, in and out of hospitals, for years,\\n      wearing out the strength and means of her relatives and the patience of\\n      many physicians, was at length abandoned by them. It was a case of spinal\\n      and cerebral neurasthenia complicated with hypochondriasis in its most\\n      trying form of introspective maunderings and endless description of\\n      symptoms. She tormented her advisers by her endless tirades, the\\n      indulgence of which invariably aggravated her condition, and were there\\n      fore avoided, until once her physician yielded to the patient\\'s\\n      importunities for a visit, when be found her in her usual abject state of\\n      prostration. Guided by experience derived from cases like the one first\\n      described, he assisted the patient to her feet and marched her, will you\\n      nil you, up and down the room until he, at least, was thoroughly tired,\\n      and then departed with the promise never to do so again. The patient, on\\n      her part, made a number of her unnameable promises, but kept on her feet\\n      and let the doctors alone. Though not cured of deeply-rooted morbid mental\\n      faults, the neurasthenic phase of her condition had yielded to the change\\n      of the antagonistic element of her character from passive to very\\n      practical activity. A third very serious case of this kind occurred in the\\n      person of a girl of fifteen, of selfish character, who gradually became\\n      bed-ridden with spinal and cerebral neurasthenia, and tormented with the\\n      usual multifarious painful sensations, none of which, on the most\\n      pains-taking physical examination, resulted from demonstrable organic\\n      disease of genital or abdominal organs. The patient was most tenderly\\n      cared for by her mother, who, in the course of years, became so imbued\\n      with the idea of yielding to every wish and whim of the patient, that at\\n      length remonstrance became useless. The mother, though recognizing the\\n      importance of persuading or urging her daughter to depend more on herself,\\n      admitted that she had yielded so long that now she must continue to feed,\\n      dress and assist her charge in the most trivial things. Her food had to be\\n      placed in her mouth, the position of a hand or foot changed by some one\\n      else, although patient did so spontaneously when she chose. This went on\\n      for fifteen years, when the mother, growing old and feeble, died. Her\\n      maternal support being gone, the patient at once proved her ability to\\n      walk, to dress, to feed herself, and to seek light employment. Though far\\n      from well, she is equally far fro being a helpless, bed-ridden invalid.\\n      \\n A fourth case, still very vividly\\n      impressed on the writer\\'s mind, was one of a healthy, romping girl of 14,\\n      who, as happen in this remarkably capricious disease, in the midst of\\n      perfect health, one day took to her bed and remained there with all the\\n      symptoms of neurasthenia, involving first the spinal and finally the\\n      cerebral nerves. This patient was very amiable, conscientious, and\\n      sensible, never loquacious, and not troubled with hypochondriacal thoughts\\n      or sensations. Tiredness was the only expression she used in describing\\n      her feelings. There was literally no variation from this condition, which\\n      confined her to her bed for years, till she grew from a girl to a woman.\\n      Eating and sleeping well, and improving perceptibly in personal appearance\\n      and character, yet she lay on her couch tired and watched over with\\n      unremitting care by a most anxious mother, showing her solicitude and\\n      sympathy in every feature. Once, in the second year of the disease, a\\n      favorable interruption occurred. The mother, still a young woman, gave\\n      birth to another child. During her confinement the neurasthenic patient\\n      was in charge of her mother\\'s nurse, assisted by other servants. The\\n      nurse, while devoted to the daughter, agreed with the writer that excess\\n      of sympathy was injurious, and used her best and judicious endeavors\\n      gradually to persuade the patient to make some physical effort at walking\\n      and standing. In this she was so successful that in two weeks she\\n      accompanied the girl on half-mile walks up and down hill, finally without\\n      assistance. Thus, recovery seemed assured, and everything was favorable\\n      progressing towards it when the mother, having fully recovered, again took\\n      charge of her daughter, with the result that she at once took to her\\n      lounge and remained there two years longer. About that time other advice\\n      was urged and gladly acceded to, with the result that the case was\\n      diagnosed by an eminent surgeon as spinal paralysis in consequence of\\n      concussion, though it could never be shown when and where it occurred.\\n      Salves, plasters, anodynes, nervines, and electricity did no good, but\\n      effectually destroyed appetite and digestion, which higher to had been\\n      normal. So this adviser resigned in favor of a third, who, being a younger\\n      and less prejudiced man, agreed perfectly with the writer\\'s original\\n      opinion. He advised return to moderate exercise, avoidance of drugs, and\\n      less display of sympathy. This, though formerly rejected as\\n      \"unkind,\" was now acceded to as coming from a nerve- specialist,\\n      fresh from Europe, at that time very rare. Still attending the other\\n      members of the family, the writer had sample opportunity of observing the\\n      course of the case. Improvement was very slow and uncertain till financial\\n      misfortune overtook the family. Almost with a bound our patient left her\\n      cough, and, organizing a kindergarten, strove energetically in supporting\\n      herself and assisting her mother. The change came about in less than three\\n      weeks, and resulted in perfect recovery.\\n      \\n At this point another very instructive\\n      case of very speedy recovery, after six or seven years of neurasthenic\\n      prostration, deserves to be mentioned. A woman of 35 had been in bed and\\n      on the lounge most of the time for nearly seven years, at the end of which\\n      time she became my patient, her regular medical attendant having gone to\\n      Europe. She was of very amiable disposition and as sensitive as she was\\n      weak. Her symptoms, as in the other cases, were instantaneous exhaustion\\n      on the least physical exertion. She could give herself up to no mental\\n      occupation beyond directing her house-hold affairs, the education of her\\n      son, and the rehearsal of her numerous sensations. She had not been my\\n      patient long when her husband failed in business, so that the family was\\n      reduced from very comfortable circumstances to a condition which made it\\n      necessary for the patient to make her own living and that of the family.\\n      This she almost at once proceeded to do, setting aside all other\\n      considerations and establishing a boarding-house, where she did most of\\n      the work herself. This she has done now for ten or twelve years without a\\n      serious relapse. The time involved in the period of convalescence was\\n      scarcely more than three weeks, a although her work maybe said to have\\n      begun at the moment her resolution was taken.\\n      \\n Prognostics.-From these and other cases\\n      in and outside of the writer\\'s practice, it is safe to say that the\\n      majority of cases of neurasthenia recover, though years may elapse before\\n      that period. We learn, furthermore, that recoveries, especially of very\\n      inveterate cases, depend on conditions beyond the control of the\\n      physician, as was the case in the above-recorded instances, where\\n      circumstances forced the patient to cases to wish for recovery and to make\\n      an effort of the will. This having been once accomplished self-confidence,\\n      for a long time in abeyance, was permanently restored.\\n      \\n Curability, further, depends very much\\n      on the temperament of the patient, whether amiable, tractable and\\n      confiding in the honest endeavors of the physician, or whether refractory,\\n      suspicious, untruthful, selfish and antagonistic, of a disposition\\n      impossible to win over on account of unnatural distrust of every\\n      well-meaning person. The degree of intelligence of patients also has a\\n      pronounced influence on the result. The most readily curable cases are\\n      those acquired without hereditary predisposition, where the cause is found\\n      in the absence of food and sleep, also where sorrow and anxiety can be\\n      averted or counteracted by judicious conduct of near relatives and\\n      friends.\\n      \\n Dietetic Treatment.-This, as medicinal\\n      treatment, must be governed by the stage at which the case comes into the\\n      physician\\'s hands-whether yet in its prodromal, its acute or its chronic\\n      phase. The prodromal stage of the disease has no very decided\\n      pathognomonic signs. The most that can be recognized in this stage is that\\n      the patient\\'s habits or duties are of a kind which will eventually lead to\\n      obdurate neurasthenia if not arrested in time by removing the exciting\\n      causes. Too much pleasure, as well as too much care, especially in girls\\n      and woman, tends to neglect of food and rest, in the absence of which,\\n      excitements, whether of pleasure or care, begets a state of unrest in\\n      which repose is disagreeable. With such a condition comes a list of\\n      incipient casual complaints of headache, imperfect sleep, notional ways of\\n      eating, working or playing. A few questions will determine whether the\\n      patient is living according to normal or abnormal habits with regard to\\n      appetite, sleep and occupation. Where these are found, their alteration to\\n      normal ways must be instead on. It is unnecessary to say that this is\\n      easier said than done, for it will probably meet with serious objections\\n      on the part of the patient, if not on that of her relatives; for most\\n      likely she has examinations for college to prepare for, involving several\\n      months of dose and careful study at night, and the patient cannot waste\\n      time in sleeping and eating while cramming that little excited and\\n      ambitions brain. A failure in the examinations would be as much of a\\n      disappointment to parents as to patient, who proves, as usual, that this\\n      appellation is a misnomer. She accordingly goes in as she please, lied by\\n      an increasing morbidly ambitions impulse, and the result is likely to be\\n      the mournful satisfaction on the part of the physician of being obliged to\\n      say, \"I told you before what would happen.\" Of course, all\\n      regret the now evident nerve-prostration, while, if the doctor had\\n      succeeded in enforcing his rules, he would in many cases experience the\\n      still more painful reproach of having been too severe. Nevertheless,\\n      absolute firmness and a kindly but unflinching exertion of his will,\\n      without the least compromise, reward the physician with the best results\\n      in such cases.\\n      \\n When the case, after the stage of\\n      excitement and untiring restlessness (at which it would still be speedily\\n      curable by simple dietetic rules) has, after weeks or months, entered upon\\n      the phase of painful prostration, here we encounter backache, oppressive\\n      headache, and absolute loss of mental or bodily endurance, measures of\\n      dietetic management are much less effective and much more difficult to\\n      find. it is at this stage that slight rise of temperature will occur,\\n      especially towards evening; then the backache and headache disappear, the\\n      pallor is replaced by a flush of color, the eyes lose their listless look,\\n      and the patient is inclined to enter upon some diversion or excitement,\\n      followed by a restless night and a morning of exhaustion and a renewal of\\n      all painful sensations. Most of such patients feel much better in the\\n      evening when they are ready for some entertainment, while in a normal\\n      state this would be the time for relaxation and repose.\\n      \\n The dietetic treatment of this stage is\\n      methodical rest. In severe cases the patient will do well to remain in bed\\n      for several days or even for weeks. It is well to shorten this period as\\n      much as possible and to insist on walking about, or, at least. sitting for\\n      a specified time every day. This may be varied b equally specified periods\\n      of rest in the recumbent position.\\n      \\n Irregularities of eating are at this\\n      and at all times to be superseded by the most rigid regularity of meals.\\n      The traditional and conventional three-meal system, however well adapted\\n      to the needs of a vigorous man or woman, does not agree with the\\n      neurasthenic patient. It is much better that these should eat oftener;\\n      four times a day is best in most cases, for the simple reason that in this\\n      way a patient, while eating less at a time, consumes more food in the\\n      aggregate.\\n      \\n As neurasthenic patients are rarely\\n      troubled with absolute aversion to wholesome food, they are generally able\\n      to consume a liberal quantity, about which it is only needful to remark\\n      here that the food should be selected from among the articles and dishes\\n      which the patient likes, provided they belong to the order of good, normal\\n      articles of food, to the exclusion of those which simply please the taste\\n      without being digestible. A dish entirely of meat or \"animal\\n      food\" is as far from being a good diet for neurasthenics as one\\n      consisting entirely of \"vegetable\" food. As a rule, the diet\\n      list should comprise one-third of nitrogenous material and two-thirds of\\n      carbohydrates. Together with these, it is a great mistake to neglect the\\n      fats, such as good butter and the fats of meats. And, lastly, every\\n      patient of this kind should be made to drink some water often, a dietetic\\n      feature too often neglected.\\n      \\n During this stage, actually fatiguing\\n      exercise of body and mind should be avoided, while, on the other hand, the\\n      patient\\'s mind should be directed away from herself, in which she is much\\n      assisted by withholding a certain kind of emotional sympathy, quite as\\n      natural as it is difficult to repress on the part of affectionate persons.\\n      Of this, a few words further on.\\n      \\n There is no definite time for the\\n      duration of this stage, which, however, depends largely on the time during\\n      which the exciting causes have acted, either aided by or without a\\n      predisposition. It is certain, however, that the sooner it is recognized\\n      and the exciting causes eliminated, so much the sooner recovery will\\n      begin. But there is a stage at which the best of experience and judgment\\n      often fail, especially in very inveterate cases. If the case is one of a\\n      patient whom the physician has had opportunity of watching at least since\\n      the earlier stages, the difficulty is not so great as it is in old cases\\n      months or even of several years\\' duration which come to treatment late. In\\n      these, the line between the intermediate stage and incipient convalescence\\n      cannot be drawn. The patient is as neurasthenic and hypochondriacal as\\n      ever; cannot bear the slightest mental or bodily exertion, not even a word\\n      or a look, without sings of apparent exhaustion, while nearly the whole\\n      time is spent in bed under anxious care of sympathetic attendants. In such\\n      cases, having become assured, by careful physical examination, of the\\n      absence of organic disease, seeing the patient generally well nourished\\n      and in fair muscular condition, the physician is warranted in assuming\\n      that the disease has run its course, that whatever morbid (pathological)\\n      process there may have been progressing in the nervous system, this\\n      process has now come to and end, but it has left the patient\\'s mental\\n      condition habituated to the moods of the past months or years, and fixed,\\n      as it were, indelibly in the memory. It is the habit that now remains, not\\n      the disease.\\n      \\n If reasonably sure of this, and calling\\n      to mind the rapid recoveries and the circumstances attending them, as\\n      above detailed, the physician is now safe in ordering a more energetic\\n      treatment, calculated to rouse the self-reliance of the patient. All\\n      visible signs of sympathy must now be set aside; the actins and demeanor\\n      of the attendants should, from this time, if not before, be changed so as\\n      to give the patient the impression that she is no longer an invalid, but\\n      expected to rely on her own exertion. Instead of being fed, the food\\n      should be placed where she must go for and eat it. She should now be\\n      expected to dress and attend, without assistance, to her natural wants.\\n      This, with some temperaments, is almost impossible, with al extremely\\n      difficult. The best course to pursue is to remove such patients from\\n      sympathetic relatives or friends, and to place them in charge of kind,\\n      reliable, but eminently practical nurses.\\n      \\n The first effect of this is either to\\n      throw the patient into a stage of helpless despondency, which, again\\n      appealing powerfully to the sympathies of those nearest to her, often\\n      frustrates the physician\\'s plans which, if firmly but kindly adhered to,\\n      would, ere long, prove of their superiority by signs of returning\\n      self-reliance and absence of complaints on the part of the patient. A\\n      second form of effect is that occurring in patients of obstreperous,\\n      selfish disposition, whose opposition and even anger is aroused by being\\n      thrown on their own resources after the removal of depressing and\\n      unpractical sympathy. This opposition or temper, often manifested in all\\n      sorts of intrigues and subterfuges on the part of the patient, if not\\n      supinely yielded to by sympathetic persons, will finally be replaced by a\\n      more rational disposition. On the whole, anger or active opposition are\\n      signs of returning energy, which, once coming to the consciousness of the\\n      patient, takes the form of self- reliance. it is this way that the cures\\n      of chronic cases above related can be explained, and physicians should\\n      profit by such experience for the benefit of their patients.\\n      \\n The general dietetic management now\\n      readily follows from what has been said, and needs only a few general\\n      modifications. The first duty of the physician will be to test the degree\\n      of reliance to be placed on the patient and her friends, ad to win them\\n      over if possible to his plans, and his success will be in proportion to\\n      the degree of confidence he is able to inspire. This personal confidence\\n      should not degenerate into a mere personal liking or attachment of a\\n      sympathy-craving neurasthenic who should discover henceforth that all\\n      sentimental expressing of sympathy are about to take a practical form,\\n      aiming at a definite result-the patient\\'s health-which she wishes but\\n      cannot exert her will to attain. The best and often the only way to do\\n      away with sentiment and to reach practical kindness is to remove the\\n      patient from certain home influence, and to place her in a hospital or\\n      elsewhere under the management of competent nurses who, without being\\n      selfish, know how to exert a certain amount of wholesome push as fast as\\n      the patient can bear it. Without the removal of sentimental sympathy, all\\n      efforts at counteracting the purely hypochondriacal side of neurasthenia\\n      are useless.\\n      \\n In these cases of neurasthenia as yet\\n      uncomplicated with the hypochondriacal element of introspective nosomania,\\n      there is only one unconditional rule to be followed, especially in\\n      acquired cases whose evident cause was incessant, conscientious work of\\n      mind and body, together with insufficient food and sleep. Such cases come\\n      on very insidiously, the loss of strength-that is, the actual waste of\\n      nerve-substance-being just a trifle grater than the quantity restored, the\\n      patient unconsciously using up a minute part of her capital every day.\\n      Here the rule should be to reverse matters to insuring a supply of\\n      nourishment and time for its assimilation greater than was the case\\n      heretofore. The case of young school-girls belong in this class. The time\\n      of food and rest should be carefully controlled at home, the duty of the\\n      physician being to educate indifferent and ignorant parents up to an\\n      appreciation of the nature of the case. It is generally not difficult to\\n      open their eyes through the medium of their anxiety concerning their\\n      children\\'s health. Having thus insured sufficient rest and food at home,\\n      the physician\\'s next object of attention should be the regulations of the\\n      school. Here is the point where teachers have an opportunity of exerting\\n      their most practical influence. It should be made obligatory on the part\\n      of teachers to institute inquiry as to whether pupils have had their meals\\n      before coming to school. This they could often ascertain without a\\n      question, by reading the pupil\\'s condition in her emaciated form, pale\\n      face and nervous manner. To guard against neglect at home, it would be an\\n      easy matter to insist that all pupils of public and private schools should\\n      bring with them some proper food. The few who do so generally bring\\n      sweets-an apple, orange or a few dry crackers-when a piece of good bread\\n      and slice of cold meat would be what they actually need. All pupils should\\n      pass inspection, and if remiss in this important particular, the\\n      delinquent should be dismissed with several marks against her. To expect\\n      this of teachers would be a great advance in the place of futile\\n      innovations of endeavoring to send forth from our common schools graduates\\n      in arts and sciences.\\n      \\n Sudden Effects.-A large number of cases\\n      of neurasthenia, especially those complicated with inveterate\\n      Hypochondriasis, are frequently traced to some sudden occurrence, having\\n      the effect of a mental or physical shock. In one patient, a vigorous girl,\\n      used to romping, climbing and running lie a boy, the cause was supposed to\\n      be a slight thump she received during a game of blindman\\'s-buff. She\\n      thought nothing of it at the time, but it was suggested long after the\\n      patient\\'s illness began. In another case some mental shock of joy or\\n      grief, not very severe and such as is often experienced in every person\\'s\\n      life, is the beginning of months of nervous prostration.\\n      \\n There is quite an array of evidence\\n      that neurasthenia which has entered upon a hypochondriacal stage or\\n      complication with or without a strong hysterical admixture, is curable by\\n      sudden impressions in the form of a shock, or more gradually by frequent\\n      repetitions of an impression. Such cases, as I have shown above, occur\\n      most commonly in the stage when what may be considered the essential\\n      pathological disturbances of function have run their course and have left\\n      the patient in a state of mental disturbance which indicated that the\\n      patient\\'s recovery depends entirely upon her volition. But there is none,\\n      and so far nothing has succeeded in arousing it. Persuasion is as useless\\n      and irritating, as argument would be in a case of insanity with a fixed\\n      illusion. The resemblance between this and the state of mind of a\\n      hypochondriacal neurasthenic is very close. She cannot move nor thick.\\n      Exhaustion overcomes her and keeps her its victim for years, when suddenly\\n      the scene changes, and a few days or weeks suffice to restore the patient\\n      to activity. In one instance it is attributed to medical, in another to\\n      \"mind cure,\" in a third to \"Christian science;\" in\\n      still other cases massage has done it, in others again \"magnetic\\n      influence,\" in others the very powerful factor necessity. It is\\n      certain that cases of this kind, produced by sudden effects on the mind of\\n      a predisposed person, are also cured by such effects. Whatever the visible\\n      form of these effects may be -whether that of \"Christian\\n      science,\" joy, grief or absolute inexorable necessity, there is\\n      always to be noticed a certain force and condition involving the modern\\n      idea of suggestion, which comes to the patient in an irresistible degree\\n      and now sets the function of the will in motion again.\\n      \\n Experience teaches that it is by no\\n      means a matter of indifference which of these forms of effect are brought\\n      into action. In one case it is the professional Christian scientist\\'s\\n      method, in another the almost brutal exertion of a person\\'s will combined\\n      with some physical force. In either case the patient is aroused from his\\n      inertia, and discovers his powers of mental and bodily ability to act.\\n      \\n A deplorable result is that recoveries\\n      after such effects are attributed in the popular mind to supernatural\\n      causes. That such is not the case may be gathered form instances occurring\\n      in very sensible and intelligent patients, whose reason is scarcely ever\\n      so far disturbed and weakened that they do not resent the proposition of\\n      trying, e.g., Christian science or mind cure.\\n      \\n Nevertheless, it is the mind cure which\\n      the intelligent patient needs quite as much as the ignorant and\\n      superstitious person; the difference is only the form in which the\\n      influencing force is applied. While in one case it is obedience to the\\n      candidly expressed instructions of the physician, in the other case the\\n      result is the to mystification. In either case it is the powerful stimulus\\n      of hope and aroused confidence that recovery will be realized.\\n      \\n The definition of suggestion does not\\n      fully cover the meaning, because the influence employed is greater than\\n      mere suggestion. The physician\\'s plan of action should be straightforward\\n      assurance of recovery, a direct appeal to hope, and an unceasing endeavor\\n      to arouse the self-reliance of the patient, not so much by verbal\\n      exhortations as by a manner and department from which the patient learns\\n      more readily than from words what is expected. If the attitude of the\\n      physician is appreciated, and seconded by the relatives and attendants, a\\n      favorable result is much more certain to follow.\\n      \\n Hypnotism is not advisable. There are\\n      now existing ancient neurasthenic invalids dating from the times of\\n      spiritualism when they were famous \"mediums.\" Hypnotism weakness\\n      the will and nervous endurance, and produces a predisposition to emotional\\n      nervousness with an intractable erotic admixture. The suggestions sought\\n      to be instilled into a hypnotized patient amount to nothing. The mental\\n      influence of mystical treatment administered while the patients is awake\\n      is much more powerful in awaking hope and confidence than the uncertain\\n      effects of an abnormal state like that of hypnotism. Mystification, again,\\n      though sometimes unavoidable with the best intention, is less powerful\\n      than direct and intelligible encouragement. While resort to mystification\\n      should be shunned by reputable physicians, the question arises as to what\\n      shall be done with the many who, from lack of intelligence or education,\\n      are entirely beyond the reach of honest common sense, and who will persist\\n      in mystifying themselves, who remain neurasthenic invalids in spite of the\\n      best regulations of the physician, and who do not recover unless their\\n      encouragement follows some mystical formalities which alone arouse their\\n      \"faith\" and finally their confidence and will-power. For the\\n      present there is no way out of the dilemma but to submit such patients to\\n      the suggestive methods of what is popularly known as mind cure and\\n      Christian science. In doing so, physicians should use their influence as\\n      far as possible in selecting the most honest persons of this class.\\n      \\n DISCUSSION.\\n      \\n JAMES C. WOOD, M.D.: I have nothing but\\n      words of praise for Dr. Wesselhoeft\\'s excellent paper. It is very evident\\n      that the author\\'s inspiration came not from books but from actual contact\\n      with neurasthenic subjects, for the impress of originality is most\\n      conspicuous. It is a production which could only come from one of\\n      experience and from a reasoner. I consider it a most valuable contribution\\n      to the literature of that now most interesting subject,\\n      \"neurasthenia\".\\n      \\n The doctor, in his paper, has sometimes\\n      used the term \"neurasthenia\" instead of\\n      \"neurasthenia.\" The first of these means, according to Thomas,\\n      great nervous power or excitement; the second, nervous debility. I taken\\n      it from the context that the subject dealt with is neurasthenia. To the\\n      average mind there exists what seems to me a needless confusion regarding\\n      the terms, nervous prostration, hysteria and hystero-neurosis. As I\\n      understand these terms they define distinct conditions, though there is a\\n      frequent blending the one with the other. The term nervous prostration,\\n      which is a synonym of neurasthenia, defines itself; the term hysteria\\n      should be restricted to those general neuroses characterized particularly\\n      by psychical manifestations, though not infrequently by motor, sensory,\\n      secretory, vasomotor and reflex derangements as well; while the term\\n      hysteroneurosis implies the uterine origin of symptoms manifesting\\n      themselves in organs remote from the uterus without structural changes in\\n      such organs, being the direct result of reflex nervous influence starting\\n      from the uterus. The last term does not occur in the paper under\\n      discussion. From the standpoint of a gynecologist I think that this is\\n      misleading.\\n      \\n Let us see why and how it is that these\\n      three conditions (I will not call them diseases) are so frequently\\n      associated. I think that all will admit the frequent occurrence in woman\\n      of reflex symptoms, the result of pelvic lesions. An irritation staring\\n      form the pelvis is conveyed to the genito-spinal centre, thence to any or\\n      all organs with which this centre communicates. The organ oftener involved\\n      than any other is the stomach. This is shown by the frequent occurrence of\\n      nausea and vomiting following conception. The nervous system may have been\\n      previously involved, but oftener it becomes so only after the nutrition is\\n      depraved, which, sooner or later, occurs if the pelvic lesion is not\\n      removed. The depraved blood fails to supply the nerve centres with that\\n      which they need to sustain them, and they become anaemic. Prostration is\\n      but a subjective manifestation of the anaemia, and it varies in degree\\n      from a slight indisposition to the most abject helplessness.\\n      \\n If, then, nervous prostration may have\\n      its beginning in a pelvic lesion, is it possible for a pelvic lesion to be\\n      inaugurated by systemic disturbances? Personally, I believe that it is,\\n      and offer this explanation as the modus operandi by which such a lesion is\\n      induced: Marked circulatory changes nearly always attend nervous\\n      prostration. The circulation is presided over by the vaso-motor system,\\n      and wear and repair depend upon the proper regulation of this system. If\\n      it becomes disturbed, the bloodvessels dilate or contract unduly, with\\n      resulting local hyperaemia or local anaemia, as the case maybe. The\\n      climacteric flushes are the result of such disturbance. The alternate\\n      coldness and heat of the extremities, so often associated with rectal and\\n      uterine lesions, is another familiar illustration. If the brain is\\n      involved, either insomnia or drowsiness occur, depending upon whether the\\n      brain is anaemic or hyperaemic. Flatulence, gastralgia, and nervous\\n      dyspepsia result when the stomach is similarly affected. The womb and the\\n      ovaries, because of the periodical congestion imposed upon them, are\\n      oftener implicated by these unnatural circulatory disturbances than any of\\n      the pelvic organs, and in time also become unduly hyperaemic or anaemic,\\n      as the case may be.\\n      \\n It will thus be seen that nervous\\n      prostration may exist independently of pelvic lesions, or, conversely,\\n      pelvic lesions may exist independently of nervous prostration.\\n      Nevertheless, the two are frequently associated, and this fact ought, I\\n      believe, to be kept in mind in dealing with the affection known as\\n      neurasthenia. Hysterical manifestations nearly always come to the surface\\n      in nervous prostration, and they also frequently attend pelvic lesions.\\n      Indeed, the term \"hystero-psychosis\" has been coined for the\\n      purpose of defining certain psychical disturbances of presumably pelvic\\n      origin, and in the broadest sense neurasthenia is not uncommonly an\\n      hysteroneurosis. It is the frequent association of these three conditions\\n      which, it seems to me, makes it more practicable to study them conjointly.\\n      \\n The special symptoms of nervous\\n      prostration are most variable. Introspection, as Dr. Wesselhoeft has\\n      pointed out, makes of the patient a nosomaniac. The anaemic nerve centres\\n      are unduly impressionable, and a mental shock which would not seriously\\n      affect a stronger and more rugged woman falls with crushing force upon one\\n      whose nutrition is already depraved. In this way are developed disorders\\n      of sensibility, alternations of mobility, circulatory disturbances,\\n      anomalies of secretion and exertion, disorders of the gastro-intestinal\\n      canal, dermatoses, and general and psychical disturbances of all kinds.\\n      Many of these affections start from pelvic lesions, and are nearly always\\n      associated with depravity of nutrition and more or less nervous\\n      prostration.\\n      \\n Some of the worst symptoms of\\n      neurasthenia with which I have had to contend have been hyperaesthesia of\\n      the articulations, giving rise to the so-called \"hysterical\\n      joint.\" Here the prostration is usually not profound, and it is\\n      possible to apply the somewhat energetic treatment recommended by Dr.\\n      Wesselhoeft. I remember one case very distinctly, the detailed history of\\n      which I shall give in another place, which brought me much reputation\\n      because of the \"remarkable\" cure I was fortunate enough to make.\\n      \\n The patient, a beautiful girl of\\n      eighteen, had been bed- ridden for three years with supposed hip-joint\\n      disease. She was in college before assuming the ride of an invalid, and\\n      worried much over her studies and work. She sustained a fall a short time\\n      previously to taking to her bed, and to this fall the injury to the hip\\n      was attributed. She had been from physician to physician and from\\n      sanitarium to sanitarium without receiving benefit. All of the numerous\\n      medical men under whose care she had been, directed their attention to the\\n      hip and applied the classical treatment for morbus coxarius without avail.\\n      The patient had finally reached a point where introspection was her chief\\n      occupation and her mind dwelt almost continually upon a \"diseased\\n      hip.\" She was finally brought to me, coming in an invalid\\'s chair and\\n      looking the very picture of dependency. There was a slight degree of\\n      anaemia, though this was not marked. Notwithstanding the expression\\n      expression of abjectness the girl did not look seriously ill. The hip was\\n      excessively tender upon pressure, but there was no local increase of\\n      temperature, no evidences of fever and suppuration, and forcible\\n      apposition by striking the heel was not very painful. More less spastic\\n      contraction of the flexor muscles of the affected side existed, which gave\\n      to the limb an appearance of actual shortening, which was very deceptive.\\n      Hysterical symptoms were common. On examination I found the left ovary\\n      exquisitely tender. Compression of the ovary increased the pain in the hip\\n      most decidedly and gave rise to much nervous agitation. I did not,\\n      therefore, deem it wise to recommend local treatment other than the daily\\n      use of the hot douche. She had long been a victim of ovarian\\n      dysmenorrhoea. I placed upon the ankle of the affected limb three pounds\\n      of bar-lead, prescribed a pair of crutches and insisted upon her walking.\\n      The lead was used to overcome the spastic contraction as well as for its\\n      moral effect. I did not deem the joint lesion of such a character as to\\n      used extension. In two months\\' time this patient discarded her crutches\\n      for a cane. Six weeks later she put up the cane and is now perfectly well.\\n      \\n This was a case in which somewhat harsh\\n      measures were eminently appropriate.\\n      \\n In marked contrast to the case just\\n      recorded is the following: Mrs.-, aet. 47, widow for twenty years. She is\\n      a devoted church-woman, and for years was a leader in all charitable work\\n      done in the community in which she resided. Through friends she was urged\\n      to consult me, and I think that the call to the neighboring town in which\\n      she lived was countermanded at least four or five times before the finally\\n      mustered up courage and strength enough to see me. Upon reaching the\\n      bedside I found my patient in a room made dark by closed blinds, over\\n      which were hung heavy blankets to shut out every ray of light. The mirror\\n      was turned toward the wall for fear a ray of light might strike it and\\n      flesh throughout the darkened room. Nor did the patient rest under these\\n      extreme precautions, for the eyes were protected with two pairs of colored\\n      glasses with side attachments. Hyperaesthesia of the sense of hearing was\\n      equally marked and the noise was excluded from the room by double doors\\n      whose keyholes were stuffed with cotton. She l so had her ears filled with\\n      cotton, over which she wore ear-mufflers. She was emaciated to an extreme\\n      degree, and had been reduced to her miserable condition by a series of\\n      events which frequently precede profound neurasthenia. Her husband was\\n      killed during the war, and she was left childless. Twelve months previous\\n      to taking to her bed she nursed her mother through a long and fatal\\n      illness. This greatly prostrated her, yet she kept up until a favorite\\n      brother-in-law was thrown from a carriage and killed. This was the last\\n      straw, and the shock compelled her to take to her bed. In due time loss of\\n      appetite with irritability of the stomach developed, which, of course, led\\n      to marked depravity of nutrition. With the anaemia came hyperaesthesia of\\n      the special senses, spinal irritation, headache, hysterical\\n      manifestations, etc. There was no series pelvic lesion, although she had\\n      been much treated for an alleged uterine displacement with congestion.\\n      Unfortunately, she was encouraged, instead of discouraged, in her\\n      invalidism, and she soon became a nosomaniac of the worst type. She had\\n      written down her symptoms one at a time, and the record is such a typical\\n      one that I should like to give it in full, but time forbids.\\n      \\n With great difficulty the patient was\\n      moved on a cough to a private hospital and placed under the Weir Mitchell\\n      treatment. I ignored the pelvic trouble entirely. It is unnecessary to\\n      give in detail the progress of the case from day to day after this\\n      treatment was inaugurated. Suffice it to say that the improvement was of\\n      the most marked character, and in six weeks from the time she entered the\\n      hospital she walked to her carriage with her eyes and ears unprotected.\\n      She soon resumed her church and charitable work, in which she again takes\\n      much delight.\\n      \\n This woman wanted to get well. She was\\n      a woman of pure motives and high ideals. She had, in the language of Dr.\\n      Wesselhoeft, the wish, but, unaided, not the will. She required the aid of\\n      an intelligent, strong-minded, nurse who could bring to her exercise\\n      applied in such a way as to enable her to assimilate food without the\\n      expenditure of nerve force. She co- operated with her physician and nurse\\n      in every possible way, and as soon as the anaemic nerve cells became\\n      flushed with new blood she began to improve. To have commanded this\\n      patient \"to take up her bed and walk\" before improving her\\n      nutrition would have been as unscientific as to have placed the first\\n      patient in bed with extension and counter-extension applied to the limb. I\\n      know of no class of cases requiring for their successful treatment more\\n      tact and discrimination than that under consideration.\\n      \\n I feel confident that I have many times\\n      cut the affection short in its prodromal stage by removing the girl from\\n      college work and insisting upon open-air exercise. Static electricity has,\\n      in my hands, proved exceedingly useful both during the prodromal stage and\\n      that of convalescence.\\n      \\n I will conclude by saying that I have\\n      been impressed with the frequency with which an hereditary history of\\n      epilepsy has been met with in the cases of neurasthenia passing under my\\n      observation.'\n",
      " 'Tresorie - SOME OF THE DISEASES PREVENTING AND COMPLICATION PREGNANCY\\n[Diseases Preventing & Complicating Pregnancy]\\n\\n STERILITY.-DeSinety, Treub, Furbinger,\\n      et al., attribute 50 per cent. of unproductive marriages to the husbands,\\n      saying that sterility in the male is more often the cause of barren\\n      marriages than is generally supposed.\\n      \\n This cause of sterility I pass by, as\\n      also sterility due to mechanical obstruction, incomplete ovulation and the\\n      numerous other causes of this condition, too manifold for mere\\n      enumeration, to consider obesity as a causative agent in this condition. I\\n      need not say that the advocates for surgical interference for the relief\\n      of this condition are legion. Sims makes the assertion that sterility can\\n      be cured by surgical means only. That, of course, is Allopathic arguing\\n      pure and simple. Cases requiring surgical interference do arise, but any\\n      treatment which raises the nutrition of the entire organism, improves the\\n      blood-formation, and favors the resorption of pathological products in the\\n      sexual organs, is to be regarded as the indicated remedy.\\n      \\n Published statements are my authority\\n      for saying that excellent results have followed the administration of\\n      drugs, nevertheless; and in complete defiance of all therapeutic measures,\\n      a certain percentage of women remain barren; for with the more occult\\n      causes of sterility we remain, as yet, unacquainted, consequently they\\n      cannot all be reached with say kind of treatment whatever.\\n      \\n The following case I report somewhat in\\n      detail. Whilst not an exceptional case at all, it bears directly upon the\\n      subject under consideration, and possesses, it seems to me, some decidedly\\n      interesting features. My object in selecting this particular one is to\\n      call attention, if possible, to a condition not sufficiently considered.\\n      Mrs. J., aet. 26, married about two years and a half, appealed to my\\n      knowledge for a reason as to why she remained childless. The lady was\\n      carrying an excess of flesh, being under the medium height, and weighing\\n      186 pounds, but appeared to be in good health; family and previous history\\n      all that could be desired. Examination showed none of the common causes of\\n      sterility; neither, so far as I could ascertain, was the husband\\n      responsible for this unproductive condition of affairs. Some previous\\n      experiences of my own, with the added testimony of other and able men, was\\n      my reason for charging this condition of things to the excess of flesh,\\n      this, by the husband, being laughingly charged to excess of laziness.\\n      \\n We all, undoubtedly, are familiar with\\n      that peculiar disease of the blood-corpuscles which, whilst producing\\n      flesh, relaxes at the same time the muscular force; acting also, I\\n      believe, upon the muscular fibres of the uterus and upon the ovaries,\\n      inducing not only serious menstrual disorders but sterility. McKee,\\n      Philbert, and others give several instances of sterility chargeable to\\n      obesity, the women in question having been married several years without\\n      bearing children, and all became mothers after losing a portion of their\\n      flesh. If any other argument were needed in support of this theory we\\n      might turn to the quadrupeds, where we find the poorest breeders among the\\n      fleshiest animals. Fournel has a very able treatise on \"The Effects\\n      of Obesity on the Menstrual Functions and Parturition.\" Without\\n      having had any actual case of this description to deal with, he inclines\\n      very strongly towards the belief that obesity favors sterility. In the\\n      treatment of the case before mentioned, the patient was subjected to a\\n      daily massage of the entire body, with a special pelvic massage three\\n      times a week. This, in the main, consists in elevating the uterus as high\\n      as possible with the finger in the vagina, ending with a quick and decided\\n      vibratory motion. The diet received particular attention, as at this time\\n      there was a slight gastric ailment. The indicated remedy, Thuja, was given\\n      in the minimum dose. At the end of three months almost thirty pounds of\\n      flesh was gone, a considerable reduction. As an experiment, I recommended\\n      coitus in the knee-elbow position, advising that the lady remain quiet as\\n      long as possible after coition, with thighs well flexed. She became\\n      enciente, but miscarried at eight weeks. There was, comparatively\\n      speaking, but little pain and not much subsequent haemorrhage. She made a\\n      rapid recovery. Since then a living child has been born to them.\\n      \\n I believe I am safe in saying that this\\n      result would hardly have obtained were it not for the prophylactic\\n      measures adopted.\\n      \\n At the end of the first two months the\\n      patient was attacked with haemorrhage. A similar occurrence took place at\\n      irregular intervals during the following five months, the quantity of\\n      blood lost being much greater than that at the normal menstrual period.\\n      \\n For the greater part of the last five\\n      months she kept her bed, at the end of which time the tendency of the\\n      uterus to empty itself could be resisted no longer. A seven months\\' child\\n      was born, and is to-day doing well.\\n      \\n Pseudocyesis cerebral pregnancy,\\n      phantom pregnancy (whatever name we may call it by) is a disease which\\n      must come under the head of those \"complicating pregnancy.\" Mrs.\\n      M., a lady, married two or three years, aet. 29. Previous history good,\\n      always enjoying perfect health. When I first saw the lady in question she\\n      was a perfect picture of health, and, according to appearance and her own\\n      statements, about seven months pregnant. I made no examination. This\\n      appeared to be a thoroughly intelligent woman, and, according to her own\\n      statement, there was cessation of the menses. There certainly was an\\n      enlargement of the abdomen and breasts, a milky secretion, and the lady\\n      was sure that she felt foetal movement. On February 28th of the present\\n      year I was called to attend her in labor. Examination showed that no\\n      pregnancy existed. So far as I could ascertain there was no assignable\\n      origin for this condition other than nervous influences, the phenomena\\n      being purely muscular distension of the abdomen.\\n      \\n Mayham reports a case of a woman 73\\n      years old, claiming to be pregnant; he also claims that subsequently she\\n      was delivered of a child; this is an Allopathic report, however, of which\\n      we will take a Homoeopathic dose. Haultain reports three cases of cerebral\\n      pregnancy. In the first, he says no cause whatever was to be found; in the\\n      second, there was a small fibroid growth in the anterior uterine wall.\\n      Hauck reports a case where the vomiting, peristalsis, and flatus, caused\\n      by alcoholism were supposed to be caused by the pregnant state. Such cases\\n      are uncommon, but they emphasize the importance of making a thorough\\n      examination, in all cases where positive information is desired of the\\n      existence or non-existence of pregnancy.\\n      \\n Hyperemesis Gravidarum.-An animated\\n      discussion, held recently between two celebrated Allopaths of Stuttgart\\n      and Leipsic, has served to awaken a renewed interest in this subject,\\n      without in the least adding anything new to our stock of knowledge\\n      regarding its aetiology. Notwithstanding the frequency of the vomiting of\\n      pregnancy, its very distressing character in many instances, and its\\n      imminent, its very distressing character in many instances, and its\\n      imminent danger, we find but very few contributions of any value, to\\n      either the aetiology of the disorder or its therapeutics. I do not expect\\n      to add anything specially new myself, but it does seem to me that our\\n      knowledge of the vomiting of pregnancy, is to say the least, in a most\\n      contradictory state. Some physicians look upon it as a trifling matter,\\n      others as a thing to be endured, and some-these are in the right too-view\\n      even the mildest cases with gravity. Even in the mildest cases of morning\\n      sickness there is a constant drain upon the nervous system, putting the\\n      sufferer into a condition, in which she is very much less able to endure\\n      parturition than she would otherwise have been.\\n      \\n Dr. Harrison Mettler says: \"After\\n      careful inquiry I find that women who suffer from much morning sickness\\n      have as a rule, tedious or otherwise troublesome labors. I have observed\\n      in multiparae that at one time they will have much nausea and vomiting\\n      followed by a difficult labor, while at another time they will be quite\\n      free from the vomiting, and will pass through the succeeding labor with\\n      comparative ease.\" I must say my observations make me agree with Dr.\\n      Mettler entirely; when one thinks how rapidly the mildest of cases assume\\n      pernicious forms, indifference is certainly no longer to be excused. There\\n      is a voluminous literature upon this subject, and many and varied are the\\n      aetiological reasons given for this very variable affection, a large\\n      majority of writers coinciding in the opinion that \"many causes\\n      operate together,\" to produce what we are pleased to designate the\\n      \"vomiting of pregnancy.\" I believe myself that in a large\\n      percentage of cases, this pernicious vomiting is simply the result of a\\n      reflex neurosis. Undoubtedly uterine displacements frequently cause\\n      vomiting; but when this is so, and the displaced organ is raised by\\n      packing the vagina with aseptic wool, the vomiting ceases.\\n      \\n Lillie reports a number of cases, where\\n      obstinate vomiting was caused by a retroflexed uterus, and restoration of\\n      the organ caused a cessation of the disorder. Bezugloff having a\\n      persistent case of morning sickness, introduced a bougie it no the uterus,\\n      the intention being to produce abortion; the immediate result was a\\n      stoppage of the vomiting, and the pregnancy went on to full term.\\n      \\n In the case just cited, I must say that\\n      I believe it was the fright, caused by the thought of abortion being\\n      performed, more than the effects of introducing the bougie, which operated\\n      so successfully; I say now, as I said before, I believe that the\\n      pre-eminent cause of this kind of sickness must be looked for i the\\n      nervous system. Flint speaks of this form of sickness as being decidedly\\n      neurotic in its origin, and cites a number of cases of a chronic variety\\n      of dyspepsia frequently occurring in young girls. I had one such case come\\n      under my personal care. There was a persistent morning sickness, with this\\n      young lady, and a disagreeable nausea whenever food was taken; this\\n      patient was at some distance from her home, in a boarding school, and she\\n      will probably never know that the lady principal entertained very grave\\n      thoughts at one time in regard to her virtue. It certainly was very\\n      difficult to differentiate between this and the vomiting of pregnancy; it\\n      was, however, simply due to a vitiated nervous system. My theory is\\n      supported by Alt, who records a number of such cases; I cite one only, the\\n      case being that of a highly hysterical woman, six months pregnant,\\n      suffering from the gravest vomiting, and anxious that miscarriage be\\n      induced. She was making preparation for entering the hospital for this\\n      purpose, when one of her children was seized with pneumonia. The anxiety\\n      felt over the child, forced all thought of self from the mother\\'s mind;\\n      from that moment the vomiting ceased and she remained well until the\\n      termination of pregnancy.-Minchener Medicinische Wochenschrift.\\n      \\n Whilst saying that I believe this\\n      disease to be in the majority of cases of purely nervous origin, I would\\n      not imply thereby that it is not to be feared, far from it; if neglected,\\n      we know how likely it is to pass quickly beyond treatment and our patient\\n      succumb from sheer exhaustion.\\n      \\n In the treatment cited such as\\n      insertion of bougies, dilation of the os, pelvic massage, etc., I believe\\n      it is merely the \"doing something,\" no matter much what it is,\\n      so long as you have gained the confidence of your patient, that does good.\\n      We have seen how suddenly Hyperemesis will cease if the patient be\\n      alarmed; it may be, has often been, and will to again, cured by a process\\n      skin to suggestion. Kattenback had a case where the patient, a primipara,\\n      was seized with an incorrigible vomiting. It was suggested to her that her\\n      stomach contained some lumps of unwholesome material and their removal\\n      would cure her. Some milk was given her, and the stomach ceremoniously\\n      washed out. its contents bore no indications of either over-acidity or\\n      abnormal ferment She was informed that she was all right and the vomiting\\n      would not return; neither did if, and she was safely delivered at term.\\n      \\n There is a familiar and now well-know\\n      phenomena, by which these neurotics can be influenced; I speak of\\n      hypnotism; it is due to purely subjective conditions.\\n      \\n There is an identity of the hypnotic\\n      susceptibility with the condition of hysteria, and it is along these lines\\n      that we can work. Just as many times as I have tried this method of\\n      treatment, for these cases of excessive vomiting, just so many times has\\n      it given me gratifying results.\\n      \\n The patient can be to sleep by\\n      bi-ocular pressure, and the idea of cure suggested; the operation may have\\n      to be repeated several times, at intervals of a day or so, but you will be\\n      rewarded by the cessation of the vomiting, often with but one suggestion.\\n      Where the patient is not easily controlled by means of the bi-ocular\\n      pressure, Luy\\'s revolving mirror is a never failing resource.'\n",
      " 'Tresorie - PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS [Presidential Address]\\n\\n THE ROLE OF HOMOEOPATHY IN THE SECOND\\n      \\n By ALVA BENJAMIN, M.B.CH.B., F.F.HOM.\\n      \\n Such a system of medicine must\\n      recognize that it is as much an art as a science, and that healing is a\\n      relationship between two living personalities. It must recognize too, that\\n      the sick individual has to take an active part in his treatment and not be\\n      merely the passive recipient of this or that treatment. For just as it is\\n      rightly said that man does not live by alone, so should it be emphasized\\n      that man cannot be cured by medicine alone. He must see to it himself that\\n      he lives as far as possible a physically and psychically healthy life.\\n      Indeed, each individual has a power within himself to help in his own\\n      cure.\\n      \\n Do the official schools of medicine\\n      teach such an art today? I am afraid not: they are so intent on seeking\\n      the specific treatment for this or that named disease or the antibiotic\\n      that will most effectively put out of action the organism regarded as the\\n      cause of the disease, that they are losing sight of the individual\\n      himself.\\n      \\n But Homoeopathy in its persistent\\n      search for the reactions of the individual to his environment in the\\n      broadest sense, no matter of what the patient is complaining surely\\n      fulfills these requirements, especially when it is recognized that the\\n      homoeopathic potencies do not anything to the patient as do the drugs of\\n      the dominant school, but rather stimulate the patients own recuperative\\n      powers to overcome the infection or re - establish the normal metabolism\\n      which has become deranged by the illness.\\n      \\n When you consider how the homoeopathic\\n      physician diagnoses the individuality of his patient over and above the\\n      name of the disease from which he is suffering, and uses for the purpose\\n      of his prescription rather than the name of the disease this personal\\n      diagnosis of the patients mental and emotional reactions, his responses to\\n      changes in weather conditions, the alternations in his environment which\\n      influence his symptoms, etc., one realize how very individualistic is the\\n      Homoeopathic prescription fitted to that particular patient.\\n      \\n The homoeopathic physician does not\\n      seek for a remedy specific to any named disease and which he can thus\\n      apply almost automatically once he has made his organic diagnosis, which\\n      in quite an appreciable number of instances may ultimately be found to be\\n      wrong and so the treatment based upon it must therefore have been wrong.\\n      He does not, as is so often done, merely suppress the most outstanding\\n      symptom by an appropriate drug; for example giving an anodyne to mask the\\n      pain or removing the skin eruption by some strong local application, in\\n      other words putting the dust under the mat and pretending the room is\\n      clean.\\n      \\n Strangely enough the homoeopathic\\n      physician is often accused by his allopathic critic in his ignorance of\\n      Homoeopathy, of merely treating symptoms, whereas it is the critic himself\\n      who practices this superficial medicine. The homoeopathic physician, on\\n      the other hand, treats his patient as a whole through his symptoms and\\n      their modifications through changes in the environment, which is quite a\\n      different matter.\\n      \\n Homoeopathic therapy, unlike methods of\\n      treatment, is based on a natural law \"Similia Similibus\\n      Curentur\" \"Likes may be cured by likes\" which has been\\n      proved time and time again by experiment and which anyone with the will to\\n      do may prove for himself. It is not subject to constant change brought\\n      about by this or that latest discovery, and which itself will soon have to\\n      give way to the still later idea.\\n      \\n Having now introduced to you our actor,\\n      what of the scene in which he is to play his role?\\n      \\n This is the nineteen hundred and fifty\\n      - fourth year of the Christian era and the second year of the reign of our\\n      much loved and admired young Queen Elizabeth II, who will remember while\\n      in south Africa on her twenty - first birthday, before she had any idea\\n      that she would so soon be called to such an exalted position as she holds\\n      today, broadcast to the commonwealth and Empire her resolve to dedicate\\n      her life to the service of this grand community which dedication she\\n      recently repeated at her Coronation.\\n      \\n Here in Great Britain we have a more or\\n      less complete welfare state, with which idea some of us may very strongly\\n      disagree, whilst others believe such a development is the result of a\\n      natural very desirable social evolution.\\n      \\n As one necessary ingredient of this\\n      welfare state came, in 1948, the initiation of the National Health\\n      Service, through which the great majority of the population receives its\\n      medical attention, although it is rightly available to all.\\n      \\n When we come to consider the role that\\n      homoeo - therapeutics should play in this scheme, I would suggest that we\\n      should regard the problem from the purely medical aspect, forgetting any\\n      political party allegiances or sympathies we may have; or if we cannot\\n      forget them we should remember that the organization of the National\\n      Insurance Scheme of which the National Health Service is but a part, was\\n      first blue printed by the well - known Liberal supporter, Lord Beveridge,\\n      and the Health Service plans developed by the Coalition Government of all\\n      three major political parties.\\n      \\n We are living at present in an age\\n      which may very justifiably be regarded as a violent age in which have been\\n      developed so many appalling instruments of destruction, the use of some of\\n      which we are quite complacently accepting and from the use of others we\\n      are refraining, not because we consider them immoral, but simply through\\n      the fear of the wholesale destruction which would be caused by their use.\\n      We are seeing X-rays used in very high voltages in the treatment of\\n      cancer, we are being constantly remained of the use of dangerous drugs in\\n      medicine, without justification, in my opinion, bearing in mind the\\n      doubtful and evanescent ameliorations they produce and the violent\\n      surgical treatment of mental patients.\\n      \\n One further violence we should not\\n      forget is the way some of our foods are devitalized by the extraction of\\n      this or that portion of the natural product for purposes quite foreign to\\n      the well - being of the people who are to feed on them; or they are\\n      contaminated by the addition of this or that dangerous chemical, either\\n      during the growing of the plant, in the form of sprays, or as so called\\n      improvers in, for instance, the manufacture of white bread. It is very\\n      significant in this regard that quite a lot of attention is paid to the\\n      protection of the man who sprays the crops, but the right of the consumer\\n      to have uncontaminated food is slurred over by the unjustifiable statement\\n      that the amount of these chemicals so consumed is so small that it cannot\\n      have any bad effect on the consumer. We who practice Homoeopathy know how\\n      unwarranted is such a statement.\\n      \\n Can we homoeopathic physicians and\\n      patient hope to be able to do anything to make the still small voice of\\n      Homoeopathy heard in all this tumult, so that we may return to a saner and\\n      more healthful way of life and help our young Queen in her lifes work for\\n      the communitys sake?\\n      \\n Can we expect any help from the leaders\\n      of the medical profession? I am afraid not, because although I believe it\\n      accurate to state that there is a very slowly growing interest in, and\\n      tolerance of our work by individual doctors, the medical authorities are\\n      still, in their prejudice, strongly opposed to us. The London University\\n      still refuses to recognize our Hospital as a post - graduate teaching\\n      Hospital: the British Medical Association prohibits the formation of a\\n      homoeopathic section of its organization, and the Royal College of\\n      Physicians still refuses its membership to any one known as a homoeopathic\\n      physician. Yet in spite of this unfavourable environment, I firmly believe\\n      that there is a future for our method of therapeutics: but it will have to\\n      be pursued with courage, determination, foresight and energy. Surely if we\\n      believe as I do, that we are the guardians of a system of treatment\\n      destined to make our people healthier and therefore more efficient and\\n      happier, we would be failing in our duty to our country if we did not take\\n      every means in our power to acquaint the community at large with the\\n      advantages of this system and the dangers of ignoring it. This is a duty,\\n      not only of the profession, but also of the laity interested in\\n      Homoeopathy and who have experienced its benefits.\\n      \\n Every physician has two professional\\n      obligation to the community, that of preserving its health and that of\\n      endeavouring to restore it to being when it has fallen by the way.\\n      \\n The homoeopathic physician, thorough\\n      his knowledge acquired through the provings of drugs, even in\\n      infinitesimal doses, has, I believe, a very special responsibility as\\n      regards the prophylaxis of disease. It seems to me that a great deal of\\n      chronic ill health may quite conceivably be due to the manipulations of\\n      our foods and to the artificial manuring of the ground in which many of\\n      them are grown. Experiments have been carried our proving that plants\\n      grown in soil enriched by natural manuring, are much less prone to\\n      diseases than those grown with the help of artificial chemical manures. It\\n      seems a fairly justified conclusion that vegetables grown under these\\n      artificial conditions may quite well be deficient in something necessary\\n      for our perfect health. It is therefore incumbent upon the physician to\\n      advocate whenever possible the ingestion of healthily grown foods in the\\n      widest sense of that term.\\n      \\n The same duty applies when we consider\\n      the great amount of drugging in which the community at large indulges by\\n      its excessive smoking, particularly when aggravated by the practice of\\n      inhaling, and by the continued and prolonged use of drugs for this or that\\n      symptom, too often, unfortunately, though not always, on the prescription\\n      of their medical advisors.\\n      \\n There is a great lack throughout the\\n      community of any real enthusiasm for perfect health: we are only too prone\\n      to be content to follow like sheep, the unintelligent and harmful\\n      practices of the majority of our fellows.\\n      \\n Similarly in the curative realm, we\\n      homoeopathic physicians have special obligations.\\n      \\n When considering our position vis-a-vis\\n      the rest of the profession, we must never lose sight of the fact that our\\n      approach to the sick individual is a much broader and more comprehensive\\n      one than that of the dominant school. This latter prides itself on its\\n      scientific approach to its problems. One must, however, always be on ones\\n      guard against being hypnotized by that word scientific. The scientific\\n      aspect of any phenomenon or problem dealing with humanity is only one\\n      limited aspect of that problem. To get a complete picture one must\\n      consider other aspect, such as the aesthetic, emotional, maybe religious,\\n      and above all, perhaps one might say embracing all, the philosophical\\n      approach. This complex approach to his patients problem is the one that\\n      the homoeopathic physician always strives to adopt, and so never loses\\n      sight of the ego of the patient, while at the same time not forgetting his\\n      physical make - up.\\n      \\n Because this approach of ours to our\\n      patients is a much broader and more comprehensive one than the much\\n      vaunted scientific aspect, which the dominant school has come to regard as\\n      the Ultima Thule of medicine, I deplore the oft - repeated request of some\\n      of my colleagues that we should forsake our philosophy and make our work\\n      as scientific as theirs. I do not mean to imply by this that we should\\n      neglect the scientific angle of our patients illness but we should always\\n      remember that is only one facet of our problem. That is why we take such\\n      pains to diagnose our patients personality with his reaction to his\\n      environment in addition to the physical diagnosis of the case in order to\\n      arrive at our prescription for his malady. In other words, we should\\n      endeavour to lead our dominant school colleagues to our way of thinking,\\n      rather than that we should adopt theirs.\\n      \\n At the same time must always remember\\n      that if our philosophy should seem at any time to contradict so - called\\n      scientific laws, we must re - examine our philosophy, and if necessary\\n      modify it, while at the same time remembering that many times in the past\\n      what have been regarded as laws have ultimately been proved not to be so.\\n      Thus it is evident that we must never relax our self - examination.\\n      \\n What shall be the role of the\\n      homoeopathic laity?\\n      \\n The first thing for them to remember is\\n      that we are living in a democratic country whose government is dependent\\n      on the goodwill of the governed, and that, if a sufficient number of\\n      voters desire a certain line of action, that line will be adopted by the\\n      government.\\n      \\n The second thought is that there are\\n      not nearly sufficient doctors practising Homoeopathy in Great Britain to\\n      satisfy the present demand, let alone any further increased demand in the\\n      future, for this line of treatment.\\n      \\n Does not this seem strange, having\\n      regard to the great advantage to humanity that Homoeopathy provides? Not\\n      if one looks below the surface and so finds the reason for this shortage.\\n      \\n Surely the most potent reason is that\\n      Homoeopathy is not taught in the official Medical Schools, either as a pre\\n      - or post - graduate study. The London University when asked to recognize\\n      the Royal London Homoeopathic Hospital as a post - graduate Medical\\n      School, refused on the plea that as Homoeopathy was not taught in the\\n      undergraduate Medical Schools, it could not find a place for it in its\\n      post - graduate curriculum.\\n      \\n It is, of course, nonsense to suggest\\n      that a graduate should pursue his studies only in those subject of which\\n      he had already obtained some knowledge in his undergraduate days and\\n      should not wish to obtain information on any new or extra subject.\\n      \\n The University Medical Shools are\\n      enabled to a great extent through Government grants. We must therefore\\n      find some way of influencing whatever Government be in power to bring\\n      pressure to bear upon the London University to remove this obstacle to the\\n      better health of the community at large. I am quite satisfied that once\\n      this academic recognition is obtained we shave many more post - graduate\\n      students of Homoeopathy.\\n      \\n I believe than in a democratic\\n      community, having a universal State Medical Service, it is the bounden\\n      duty of the Government to remove all obstacles to the peoples obtaining\\n      that form of medical treatment in which they have confidence. So long as\\n      Homoeopathy is denied its legitimate status, so long must be Government be\\n      deemed to b failing in its duty to the country.\\n      \\n If, however, we are to achieve this\\n      desirable object of full recognition, we must all, professional and laity,\\n      be fired with enthusiasm, not only for the abstract cause of Homoeopathy,\\n      but for being partners with our young Queen in delicating our lives to the\\n      community.\\n      \\n When we do this we shall help to make\\n      this second Elizabethan era one to be remembered throughout the ages to\\n      come as surpassing the first Elizabethan era in that it gained not so much\\n      the economic and political leadership of the world - though that is not to\\n      be despised - but showed the way to the most healthful and spiritual way\\n      of life that all the world look notice and followed suit.\\n      \\n To sum up, the Role of Homoeopathy, as\\n      I see it, is to humanize the practice of medicine. By that I mean it must\\n      bring the practice of medicine into line with a reasoned philosophy of\\n      life, restore to it its artistry and rid it of all unnecessary hazards. It\\n      is to do this, not from any abstract academic sense of superiority, but in\\n      order the years to come are not those of merely another reign, but to\\n      ensure a veritable Renaissance, starting with the second Elizabethan era\\n      in which Great Britain will take its rightful place in the comity of\\n      nations as the pathfinder to a way of life for which posterity will be\\n      able to say \"Thank God for Queen Elizabeth the Second and her\\n      peoples.'\n",
      " 'Tresorie - Roentgenometric Pelvimetry [Roentgenometric Pelvimetry]\\n CHARLES W.PERKINS, M.D.\\n      \\n Norwalk, Conn\\n      \\n FOR some time the x-ray has been used\\n      to advantage in diagnosis of multiple pregnancy, position of fetus and\\n      fetal abnormalities. However, it has been only the past four or five years\\n      that any definite information has been obtained by roentgenographic\\n      methods of diagnoses in pelvimetry.\\n      \\n At the present time we are convinced\\n      that only by means of roentgenographs can be true proportions of the\\n      superior strait be determined, and that the ordinary external methods of\\n      Pelvimetry are not only occasionally misleading but proportionately\\n      inaccurate.\\n      \\n The present communication deals with\\n      the method of Herbert Thomas of Yale University. This method was developed\\n      in cooperation with the late Dr. W.A. Lafield, who was Professor of\\n      Roentgenology at the Yale Medical School.\\n      \\n Some of the reasons why roentgen\\n      pelvimetry has not been more universally adopted are probably due to the\\n      following factors.\\n      \\n (1) The majority of women will be\\n      delivered normally, whether or not pelvic measurements are made.\\n      \\n (2) The medical profession does not\\n      readily accept a new method after an established satisfactory routine has\\n      been in use.\\n      \\n (3) A new method of diagnosis incurs\\n      added expense.\\n      \\n (4) The present methods, although\\n      entirely speculative, are satisfactory in most cases.\\n      \\n (5) Roentgen pelvimetry cannot be\\n      performed by the obstetrician himself but requires the aid of a\\n      roentgenologist.\\n      \\n (6) The value of roentgenometric\\n      diagnosis is recent in origin and as yet not universally accepted.\\n      \\n If the knowledge of the size and shape\\n      of the pelvis is necessary to the practice of obstetrics, roentgen\\n      pelvimetry is a sound procedure, particularly in pre-emptors patients, and\\n      should and should be considered as an indispensable aid in these cases.\\n      \\n The method of Herbert Thoms as\\n      developed at Yale Medical School is not the only method. However, it can\\n      be classified as simple, accurate and rapid; being adaptable for use by\\n      other than experts in x-ray and obstetric diagnosis. As a technical\\n      procedure a well trained hospital technician can master its technic alter\\n      sufficient instruction.\\n      \\n Studies of recent years reveal the fact\\n      that external Pelvimetry fails to give uniform and accurate information in\\n      regard to the shape and size of the superior strait. This is often true of\\n      thin undersized individuals. In many patients of this type external\\n      measurements may suggest a contracted pelvis while the x-ray will show a\\n      relatively large pelvis with a subsequent natural labor and normal-sized\\n      child. On the other hand a stocky short person with similar external\\n      measurements will disclose a contracted pelvis which is an obstetric\\n      problem. Because of the apparent relationship between shortening of the\\n      transverse diameter and a secondary persistent occipito-posterior\\n      presentation, accurate information regarding this diameter is of clinical\\n      significance.\\n      \\n The observations of Thomas were made on\\n      twenty consecutive patients whose pelvis showed a relative or real\\n      shortening of the transverse diameter of the superior strait. In every\\n      instance a primary or secondary occipito posterior position was found\\n      after the patient was in labor. (Herbert Thoms, Surgery, Gynecology and\\n      Obstetrics, January, 1933). It therefore has been proved that an actual or\\n      relative shortening of a transverse diameter of the superior strait\\n      results in a limitation of space that is greater in the anterior than in\\n      the posterior half of the superior strait. Under these circumstances, when\\n      the head descends early in labor, the occiput is forced to rotate\\n      posteriorly.\\n      \\n The x-ray offers additional information\\n      in determining the size of the fetal head. It has been noted in x-ray\\n      examination of the unengaged fetal head that it lay with the transverse\\n      diameter of the superior strait, the occiput being either to the right or\\n      left; therefore, if roentgenogram of the patient is taken in the supine\\n      position with the fetus in the uterus, it will cast a shadow which is an\\n      enlarged profile of the head. The measurements of the occipital frontal\\n      diameter of the head can then be made. On numerous occasions this method\\n      of cephalometry, determining the diameter of the unmoulded head before and\\n      after cesarean section, has yielded accurate results. (Thomas, A.M.A.,\\n      February 24, 1934).\\n      \\n As experience increases in roentgen\\n      pelvimetry, the so-called labor test will be employed less. This, however,\\n      does not mean that the physician should not under estimate the importance\\n      of uterine contraction and the ability of the fetal head to mold. It has\\n      always followed that when something could be proved desirable in medicine\\n      for the better protection of the patient, such an advance would be\\n      demanded and eventually become routine. We may concede, therefore, that\\n      roentgen pelvimetry has a distinct place in the examination of every\\n      primiparous woman. In many instances, according to Thomas and others,\\n      external; measurements were normal but the x-ray examination revealed a\\n      contracted pelvis. On the other had, in certain patients whose external\\n      measurements suggested a cesarean section roentgen pelvimetry proved\\n      otherwise and they were subsequently delivered in a normal manner.\\n      \\n CENTIMETER GRID METHOD.\\n      \\n The procedure in this method may be\\n      summarized by stating the following:.\\n      \\n (1) The patient is placed on the\\n      roentgenographic table in the semi- recumbent position.\\n      \\n (2) The level of the superior strait\\n      above the sensitized film is established.\\n      \\n (3) The tube target is centered about\\n      five centimeters posterior to the symphysis, at thirty-two inches from the\\n      sensitized film, The exposure is made.\\n      \\n (4) The patient is removed from the\\n      table, the tube target and sensitized film remaining in situ.\\n      \\n (5) A lead plate, or centimeter grid,\\n      with perforations exactly one centimeter apart, is introduced into the\\n      same plane as that previously occupied by the superior strait and a second\\n      (flash) exposure is made on the same sensitized film as was used used in\\n      the previous exposure.\\n      \\n (6) Development of the film shows the\\n      outline of the superior strait and the shadows of the perforations, the\\n      assistance between which represents centimeters in the plane of the\\n      superior strait. The anteroposterior and transverse diameters of the\\n      superior strait in its use proportions may be drawn on centimeter-square\\n      paper by following the course of the shadow of the superior strait and\\n      transcribing it.\\n      \\n As this time I wish to express my\\n      thanks to Dr. Thoms for his personal advice and instruction which helped\\n      me to master the technic of his method.'\n",
      " 'Tresorie - NOTATU DIGNUM [Test Of A Homoeopath]\\n\\n Complaints are not unfrequently made\\n      that the homoeopathic materia medica is too vast for practical utility;\\n      that the schematised list of symptoms are unprofitable, if not impossible\\n      reading. I do not think so. Indeed, I think that the test of a genuine\\n      homoeopath might not unfairly be said to life in his capacity to read\\n      through a Schema with both profit and enjoyment because of the\\n      possibilities it reveals of dealing with cases occurring every day in\\n      practice.

      " 'Tresorie - THE EFFICACY OF THE VIBROMETER IN APPLYING VIBRATORY MASSAGE\\nIN AURAL DISEASES [Efficacy Of Vibrometer In Applying Vibratory Message In Aural\\nDisease]\\n\\n SINCE presenting my paper before the\\n      American Institute, in June of last year on \"Vibratory Motion as a\\n      Method of Massage in Aural Diseases,\" I have been using an instrument\\n      specially devised for that purpose called the \"vibrometer.\" This\\n      instrument is in shape like a banjo, and has four strings stretched across\\n      its length resting on a bridge, which sets upon a diaphragm. On each side,\\n      elevated above the diaphragm and supported by posts, are two horizontal\\n      bars, which support the mechanical appliances used for producing the\\n      various vibratory motions. This consists in what is called a yoke, in\\n      which revolves a shaft connected with the electro-motor by pulley-wheels\\n      and a belt. Behind the diaphragm is a shallow air-tight compartment,\\n      leading from which are rubber tubes that are inserted in the external\\n      auditory canal during treatment, consequently any vibratory motion of the\\n      diaphragm, which must necessarily be an inward and a corresponding outward\\n      movement, would be exactly reproduced upon the membrana tympani, as the\\n      confined air, not being able to escape, will undergo an alternate\\n      condensation and rarefication in the external auditory canal.\\n      \\n Every vibratory movement of the strings\\n      of the instrument is communicated to the diaphragm by means of the bridge\\n      upon which it rests. These strings by varying their tension and length can\\n      be regulated to give a high or low rate of vibration as desired, for\\n      instance, the heaviest string left at its original length adjusted to a\\n      slight tension may make about fifty vibratory motions to the second, while\\n      the highest string on the instrument adjusted to a high tension and\\n      clamped down to one-fourth its original length would probably make three\\n      thousand vibratory motions to the second.\\n      \\n In the centre of the diaphragm is an\\n      attachment which works on a lever, and when hit by the cam on the\\n      revolving shaft lifts the diaphragm to a considerable extent, causing a\\n      powerful effect on the membrana tympani. This attachment can be adjusted\\n      at four different leverages, which causes a modification or increase of\\n      its intensity and can be regulated at from one to twenty-five vibratory\\n      movements to the second. This is only used in very bad cases and for not\\n      more than five minutes continuously.\\n      \\n The instrument which I have been\\n      describing in an improvement on the first manufactured, and as far as I\\n      know, is the only one which offers the same facilities for applying this\\n      method of massage. The class of patients in my experience who are\\n      generally benefited from the first, are those in which the mucous membrane\\n      lining the tympanic cavity and Eustachian tubes is in a hypertrophic\\n      condition. The membrana tympani are depressed, opaque, and thickened. They\\n      usually complain of a stiffed sensation in the ears, with a great deal of\\n      tinnitus aurium, and that their hearing is worse during a cold. In cases\\n      where the mucous membranes are atrophied with a large external auditory\\n      canal perfectly dry and Eustachian tubes patulous, and generally very\\n      little tinnitus, this or no other treatment has done very much good in the\\n      majority of cases, and in looking ever my records I find that only about\\n      five per cent. have been relieved, while in the before-mentioned cases the\\n      good results reach at least seventy-five per cent. In treating persons, I\\n      always select the rate of vibration which corresponds in pitch, if\\n      possible, to that caused by the diseased condition of the ears. If there\\n      is no tinnitus to guide me, I find whether the patient can hear a high or\\n      low sound better; if it is a low sound, a high rate of vibration is used\\n      in treatment, and vice versa, A point which I would like to explain here\\n      is this: It is not necessary that the sound from the instrument should be\\n      of the same quality of the tinnitus experienced by the patient, but merely\\n      the same pitch. for instance, if a banjo, where one of the strings was\\n      adjusted when sounded to produce a certain note, and a musical instrument\\n      of any other kind, whose quality of tone was entirely different, was made\\n      to sound the same note in a room, the string on the banjo would vibrate in\\n      sympathy, which has been proven by experiment, any other note, no matter\\n      how loud, would have no effect. Another point is in the way the strings of\\n      the vibrometer are set in motion. On the revolving shaft is a wheel\\n      projecting from which are metallic picks which hit the string it is\\n      adjusted over. It does not make any difference in the number of vibratory\\n      motions per second, whether the string is hit fast or slow, but at the\\n      time the string is first hit the intensity is greater than it is just\\n      before being hit again, and as the motion of the wheel is perfectly\\n      rhythmic, revolving so many times to the second, it has just as good an\\n      effect as if the intensity during the fraction of a second did not vary at\\n      all. The idea of using vibratory motion, as I have said before, originated\\n      within my mind some years ago, and later put into practical operation, and\\n      as far as I know, was the first to lay before the profession in a\\n      scientific manner, this method of massage.\\n      \\n I have found that when two of the\\n      strings upon the vibrometer were regulated in such a way that when both\\n      were set in vibration at the same time, producing the sensation of a\\n      harmonious sound, the effect in some cases on the tinnitus was especially\\n      beneficial, relieving, where the various kinds of vibrations produced by a\\n      single string failed. Sub-acute cases of deafness, accompanied by tinnitus\\n      aurium, are quickly relieved, as the following case will illustrate:.\\n      \\n Mrs. M. Young, married lady, aet. 26,\\n      called at my office, April 1, 1893, complaining of partial deafness and\\n      tinnitus aurium. She had a stuffed sensation, or as if cotton had been\\n      packed in the external auditory canal. She says the tinnitus was so\\n      annoying as to prevent sleep. On examination, found considerable\\n      retraction of the membrana tympani, and hearing for the watch, on the\\n      right side five inches, on the left, seven inches. The Eustachian tube\\n      were partially closed, which made inflation somewhat difficult, giving\\n      slight relief. I used several of the vibrations on the different strings\\n      without immediate benefit.\\n      \\n April 4th.-She came again, and reported\\n      that no improvement had taken place. I again inflated her ears, after\\n      which she sat down to the vibrometer. The central attachment was used with\\n      considerable force continuously for four minutes, after which she declared\\n      that the tinnitus had entirely ceased in the right ear, and greatly\\n      modified in the left; the hearing for the watch had increased for both\\n      ears to fourteen inches, and the stuffed sensation had almost entirely\\n      disappeared. On inspection of the membrana tympani, found them\\n      comparatively very slightly retracted. On April 8th, found improvement had\\n      continued, when the same treatment was used for three minutes; after which\\n      she declared herself completely relieved of the tinnitus and stuffed\\n      sensation, with hearing powerfully restored. Saw her again on April 13th,\\n      when she declared the good results from last treatment to have still\\n      continued.\\n      \\n I find that in the majority of cases,\\n      when the strings of the instrument are used it is only necessary to strike\\n      them lightly with the friction wheel. In vibrating the heavy string, I\\n      generally set the bridge back behind the central attachment, and adjusting\\n      the motor in such way that the belt is at a considerable tension, so that\\n      the pulley-wheel revolves slowly. I also generally use this adjustment\\n      when setting in motion two strings at one time. The principle of this\\n      method of treatment embraces two essential features which to my mind makes\\n      this system of massage the only scientific one applicable to the membrana\\n      tympani and its associate sound-conducting parts. Message is the\\n      application of motion to disease, and its scientific administration\\n      consists of its application in a systematic manner. In applying massage in\\n      aural diseases, it is necessary to produce a to-and-fro movement of the\\n      membrana tympani, and, if possible, by a force which is harmless and at\\n      the same time effective. The vibrometer fulfils these conditions. Any of\\n      the strings on the instrument that may be set in motion by the\\n      friction-wheel, will produce a certain number of vibratory movements to\\n      the second of time, and the movements of the central attachment are also\\n      measured. What could be more systematic than this? The motions of the\\n      membrana tympani were intended by nature to its vibratory, and as the\\n      vibrometer generates measured motion, and these motions are vibratory,\\n      theoretically we have a scientific and effective method of massage in\\n      aural diseases; and, as demonstrated practically by the use of the\\n      vibrometer, we have in fact a great scientific advance over all previous\\n      methods. Since the introduction of this treatment in aural diseases, it\\n      makes possible a more or less benefit in cases of deafness heretofore\\n      considered hopeless, and has opened up the field for the treatment of\\n      aural diseases to such an extent that the number of deaf patients seeking\\n      relief at the aurist\\'s hands will at least double itself.\\n      \\n DISCUSSION.\\n      \\n H.C. HOUGHTON, M.D.: Dr. Garey\\'s\\n      admirable paper gives us the description of the vibrometer, an instrument\\n      devised under his personal direction and inspection, for the purpose of\\n      applying massage to the ear. It is the only instrument of the kind on the\\n      market, so far as I am aware, and after a somewhat prolonged use of it, I\\n      am prepared to recommend the latest production of the vibrometer company.\\n      \\n This instrument is a decided\\n      improvement over the instrument first sent out, and is capable of\\n      producing a most profound effect upon the drum-head and ossicula; indeed,\\n      upon the entire auditory apparatus. I am able to confirm Dr. Garey\\'s\\n      statement of the effect of high and low vibrations us regards treatment.\\n      \\n I have also been very much interested\\n      in the use of stringed or reed instruments for diagnosis, and find that we\\n      can detect any abnormal sensitiveness of the auditory nerve to high or low\\n      tones. Some patients are extremely sensitive to all tones, high or low;\\n      others to high tones and not to low tones; others, conversely. Again, in\\n      some instances, there is a peculiar sensitiveness to single tones or to\\n      discords produced by sounding the note and half-note at the same time.\\n      Under the action of the central attachment of the vibrometer this\\n      sensitiveness is modified, the sensitiveness to high tones disappearing\\n      and being replaced by a low tone or, conversely, under treatment, a low\\n      tone disappears and a high tone is established, temporarily, at least.\\n      Again, in cases of recent origin, treatment will substitute an undefined\\n      rushing sound for a definite musical tone, either high or low, and later,\\n      the treatment will abolish this, the patient being relieved of this\\n      intensely annoying symptom. In some cases, with this relief, there is an\\n      improvement in the audition; in other cases, no improvement follows.\\n      \\n I confess to the domination of the\\n      material over my mind in my earlier experience with massage, and I think\\n      the inclination of operators will be to use a far greater degree of power\\n      than is necessary. I therefore notice with great satisfaction Professor\\n      Garey\\'s remark that \"the object should be to produce a to-and-fro\\n      motion to the membrana tympani, and, if possible, by a force which is\\n      harmless and at the same time effective.\" I would hardly say\\n      \"to-and-fro motion of the drum-head,\" because I think that the\\n      expression is liable to perpetuate the motion which is fixed in the minds\\n      of most physiologists, that the drum-head moves as a whole, with a\\n      to-and-fro motion.\" That is true under the influence of the Politzer,\\n      Siegle\\'s otoscope and similar instruments; but it certainly does not so\\n      move in the ordinary function of audition, but stands as the iris does in\\n      the eye, as an adjustor, a regulator of sound-force; in some sense as the\\n      iris does in its relation with the lens, to adjust, regulate and direct\\n      the essential force, and the vibration of the drum-head is at every node;\\n      every portion receives impressions that are converted into molecular\\n      disturbances of varying lengths, according as they are produced upon the\\n      stiff and unyielding portions of the drum-head at the periphery, along the\\n      manubrium, or in the more attenuated and easily-yielding portions which\\n      the between these two areas. Not only so, but these impulses are\\n      communicated to the contained air of the tympanum, and make their\\n      impression upon the acoustic nerve through the round window synchronously\\n      with the impression made through the ossicula.\\n      \\n This whole subject widens before my\\n      mind in such a way that one might wish himself twenty years and at liberty\\n      to devote himself to a term of research in acoustics, such as is offered\\n      only in the technical schools of the continent of Europe.\\n      \\n WM. R. KING, M.D.: In discussing Dr.\\n      Garey\\'s paper I shall begin by saying that his methods have been closely\\n      followed by me since the beginning of his experiments, owing to the fact\\n      that I have been greatly interested in the treatment of deafness and\\n      tinnitus by means of sound waves or by aural massage since 1887, and have\\n      experimented and treated many cases by this method since then, though with\\n      crude and unsatisfactory instruments. Since using the vibrometer-which,\\n      after much study and experimentation, is now presented to the profession\\n      in practical shape-I have undoubtedly increased my percentage of good\\n      results.\\n      \\n I don\\'t believe I am over-sanguine or\\n      carried away by interest in this method, and believe I can rightly\\n      appreciate that this does not offer us a panacea or cure-all for auditory\\n      ailments, and hope I may always be ready to see the failures and to strive\\n      to find methods or remedies to reach some of them.\\n      \\n In speaking of the application of the\\n      instrument, I wish to call attention to the central attachment or post foe\\n      vibrations. Dr. Garey has not given it as much attention in the paper as\\n      it deserves. It is very useful as a general means of aural massage,\\n      rougher in nature and more general in application than the strings which\\n      help to make up the instrument. I often use it before applying the\\n      \"similar found\" to a given case, as a species of gymnastics, to\\n      stimulate secretion and motion in the conducting apparatus of the ear,\\n      viz., membrana tympani and ossicles. In most cases-in fact, in all-where\\n      tinnitus is present, I follow this up immediately by the nearest approach\\n      to the similar pitch obtainable.\\n      \\n I agree thoroughly with Dr. Garey, that\\n      the best results are achieved in cases accompanying hypertrophic catarrh,\\n      and that the least benefit is apparent in cases of atrophic nature.\\n      \\n Regarding the method of treatment in\\n      the absence of tinnitus, my experience the does not coincide with that of\\n      the author of the paper entirely; I do not feel that as yet we have any\\n      safe rule to guide us. My method has been to try the numerous sounds and\\n      variations the of until I find the one that seems to give the best\\n      immediate results, or that the patient himself will speak of as very\\n      penetrating and powerful )though not necessarily loud and heavy).\\n      \\n It seems almost impossible at present\\n      to simulate all the qualities of tone as they occur in the ears of those\\n      suffering with tinnitus; in fact, it would appear to be unnecessary.\\n      However, it seems advantageous and quite necessary to secure the closest\\n      simulation of pitch, thus in many cases soon obliterating annoying\\n      tinnitus and improving hearing powers.\\n      \\n The arrangement permitting of the\\n      picking of two strings simultaneously adds decidedly the usefulness of the\\n      instrument, as it increases the range of pitch as well as varying the\\n      quality of tones procurable, thereby decidedly enlarging our field of\\n      application.\\n      \\n The force used for creating the message\\n      or gymnastics of the membrana tympani and the ossicles-viz, vibratory\\n      force or sound- carefully and scientifically applied, is nature\\'s remedy,\\n      because it is adapted by nature, and is the only force which can rightly\\n      or safely be applied to these delicate portions of this complex organ of\\n      hearing.\\n      \\n A startling commentary on this subject\\n      is the array of cases benefited who have been relegated to the shelf by\\n      ancient and modern otology; cases declared unhelpable have been vastly\\n      improved. Pray, make no mistake; I did not say all cases.\\n      \\n It may be interesting to hear the\\n      latest regarding the instrument which was first invented for the\\n      application of this method of aural massage Mr. E.J. Godman, the inventor\\n      and patentee, is constantly on the lookout, and always striving for\\n      improvements to his machine. He has made many that you all know of. Permit\\n      me to report a few so recent they have not yet left the factory.\\n      \\n First.-The machine has been taken from\\n      its case, and is now mounted on a solid stand or table of oak, being set\\n      below the level, or so that the face of the instrument is just level with\\n      the face of the table. This is all supported by rigid, solid metal legs,\\n      which absolutely prevent foreign vibrations.\\n      \\n Second.-The motor has been removed from\\n      its little shelf and relegated below the table. I t can be placed upon a\\n      box on the floor, a shelf against the wall, or, better yet, a shelf\\n      solidly attached to the metal supports of the table. A belt goes up\\n      through an aperture to a wheel on a shaft, the other extremity of which\\n      carries a wheel with a rubber tire (a friction wheel), which in its\\n      revolution, being in contact with a larger flat- surfaced wheel on the\\n      main shaft of the instrument, turns this in harmony with itself. This\\n      arrangement does away with the necessity of shifting the motor each time\\n      you wish to shift the carriage from one string to another- a consummation\\n      to be devoutly thankful for. The removal of the motor from the instrument\\n      as at present attached will recommend itself to all who have used the\\n      vibrometer, a great amount of undesirable jar being thus avoided.\\n      \\n Third.-Ratchet keys capable of very\\n      fine adjustment of tension of strings are now provided for the instrument.\\n      \\n Fourth.-A rheostadt or resistance-coil\\n      is now to be placed beneath the table between the storage battery and the\\n      switch, by this means enabling us to control the speed and number of\\n      revolutions to a nicety.\\n      \\n Other, though comparatively minor,\\n      improvements are being made, and others are contemplated, as, for\\n      instance, the substitution of a roughly corrugated rubber band for the\\n      picker on the wheel, thereby getting rid of the metallic sound of the\\n      picker on the wire strings.\\n      \\n I have experimented with a number of\\n      appliance for the production of the sounds and pitches that I have\\n      required, but I always fall back on the vibrometer, especially as at\\n      present constructed, for satisfactory work and results.\\n      \\n This instrument may be, and probably\\n      is, as yet, in its infancy. It, and the method it applies, can only be\\n      perfected by constant work and experimentation both on the part of the\\n      profession and of the manufacturers. Each improvement we can suggest, if\\n      it only should serve as a means of helping one solitary case, would be\\n      well worth our while.\\n      \\n The experiments being made by different\\n      methods for treating deafness by sound waves is indicative of the interest\\n      the profession has taken in the matter. It is indicative of a lack of\\n      something in our usual armamentarium which is greatly longed for by\\n      patient and doctor; that is, the means for making the deaf hear and for\\n      relieving distressing tinnitus. There has been a dearth in this direction,\\n      and perhaps there still is, but I believe fully that we have in aural\\n      massage by vibratory force a decided acquisition at our hands.\\n      \\n E. H. LINNELL., M.D.: I would simply\\n      like to ask Dr. King how long he uses the instrument, and whether he uses\\n      it according to the deafness.\\n      \\n DR. KING: Yes, decidedly. In an intense\\n      case of deafness I would have to use it a great deal longer. The central\\n      attachment I never carry over three or five minutes, and the whole\\n      treatment I don\\'t think is over carried over twenty or twenty-five minutes\\n      in one case, and usually averages from ten to fifteen.\\n      \\n HAROLD WILSON, M.D.: I have only to\\n      suggest, what I have elsewhere called attention to, the possibility of\\n      another mechanical device for securing vibratory motion. It is well known\\n      that in the make and break of a current of electricity, in the circuit of\\n      which there is a telephone, we get an influence upon the make and break of\\n      the current in the telephone. Now, it is a simple matter with which these\\n      makes and breaks are made as to obtaining any number of vibration that you\\n      wish. You may, by a mechanical device of some rotary motion, if you\\n      choose, make and break the current as rapidly as you please until you have\\n      reached several thousand vibrations a second, or you may even make the\\n      vibrations so slow us to be easily counted. The application of this\\n      suggestion has been put in force in my own practice, more or less, in the\\n      use of the telephone as connected with the induction-coil ordinary\\n      battery. The more intense the current, the more intense the sound. You can\\n      easily see that it is mere question of mechanics to secure these two\\n      sounds-intensity of vibration and rapidity of vibration. I will say,\\n      furthermore, that it has this advantage. There is no noise in the office,\\n      which I think is not altogether true of the vibrometer. I would suggest\\n      that so far as the vibrometer is concerned, if it could be made to be\\n      noiseless to anybody but the patient, it would be a decided improvement.\\n      In that respect the telephone is a decided improvement, because there is\\n      no noise except to the patient, because the noise is right at the ear of\\n      the patient. If I were seeking for a perfected instrument in this line, I\\n      would go outside of the banjo idea. As we have the most perfect writing\\n      machines, which have no connection with the ordinary method of writing,\\n      and sewing machines, which have no connection with sewing by hand, so it\\n      occurs to me that possibly the securing of he vibratory motion upon the\\n      ears might be obtained in a totally different way from that which you get\\n      when you listen to the drum of the guitar or an ordinary musical\\n      instrument, and I would suggest that the make and break of a telephone\\n      open a very fruitful field for mechanical experimentation.\\n      \\n H.C. HOUGHTON, M.D.: In my study of\\n      this subject I made the acquaintance of Mr. Bernhardt, of New York City,\\n      who is a personal friend of Mr. Emil Berliner, the inventor of the Emil\\n      Berliner Telephone, which is the instrument by which the Bell Telephone\\n      Company maintain their monopoly at present. Mr. Berliner is the inventor\\n      of the graphophone, and has, I think, covered this whole matter which Dr.\\n      Wilson has mentioned. As ordinary Bell telephone receiver is put into the\\n      circuit of an ordinary induction machine, and you can use it just as the\\n      English people use the audiometer, and as you remove the coil you modify\\n      the vibrations, which is covered with another disk and a tube, and that\\n      tube covered with a stethoscope tube, which is the same as we use for the\\n      phonograph or vibrometer, and, as Dr. Wilson has suggested, you can modify\\n      the intensity, and of course the whole matter is adjusted by the\\n      attachment of the cord, so that you can have fine vibrations. The\\n      intensity of the vibrations is regulated by the distance to which you\\n      uncover the cord. The only difficulty in the adjustment is that it has\\n      been so severe that it is really uncomfortable, and the noise of the\\n      instrument is reduced to the minimum for office use.\\n      \\n A.B. NORTON, M.D.: I will also add that\\n      in regard to the objection Dr. Wilson makes to the noise, there is no\\n      doubt it is an annoying thing in the office, and in that line I have some\\n      men at work on my suggestion. We are devising another machine, or\\n      instrument, which is to be entirely enclosed in a cabinet, so there will\\n      be no noise whatever in the room if it is made a success. The idea is a\\n      little crude, and I am quite uncertain whether it will amount to anything\\n      or not. Then, in the line of what Dr. King was speaking in regard to Mr.\\n      Goodwin-he called, at New York, to see me last week. I made two little\\n      suggestion to him, which I think would be in line with his advancement.\\n      One is the number of the picks. The present vibrometer has four picks I\\n      suggest the experiment of trying twelve or sixteen picks, which will make\\n      a more continuous sound; it may be of some value. Then, in regard to\\n      regulating the speed of the machine: you regulate that now by a series of\\n      buttons, so as to get three different speeds. We will have a very slight,\\n      intermediate speed, and a very rapid speed. My experience with the\\n      vibrometer is especially favorable. I think the idea is in the right\\n      direction, and it is simply a matter of instrumentation.']\n",

Dietary sources of vitamin C include fruits and vegetables, particularly citrus fruits such as oranges.Severe deficiency of vitamin C causes scurvy. Although rare, scurvy results in severe symptoms and can cause death. People with scurvy are treated with vitamin C and should be under medical supervision.Many uses for vitamin C have been proposed, but evidence of benefit in scientific studies is lacking. In particular, research on asthma, cancer, and diabetes remains inconclusive, and a lack of benefit has been found for the prevention of cataracts or heart disease.The use of vitamin C in the prevention or treatment of colds remains controversial. Extensive research has been conducted. Overall, vitamin C lacked an effect on the development of colds and on cold symptoms. However, the duration of the cold shortened slightly. Notably, people living in extreme circumstances, including soldiers in the subarctic, skiers, and marathon runners, had a 50% decrease in the risk of developing a cold. This area merits additional research and may be of particular interest to athletes or people in the military.'\n",

The strongest evidence supporting the use of melatonin is for delayed sleep phase syndrome, insomnia in children and the elderly, jet lag, and sleep problems in people with behavioral, developmental, or mental disorders. The weakest evidence in support of melatonin is for work shift sleep disorder. Good evidence in support of melatonin for other uses is lacking.New drugs that block the effects of melatonin are being developed. These include BMS-214778 and luzindole, and they may have uses in various disorders.'\n",
      " 'Black cohosh is popular as an alternative to hormonal therapy in the treatment of menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes, mood disturbances, excessive sweating, palpitations, and vaginal dryness. Several studies have reported black cohosh may improve menopausal symptoms for up to one year, although the evidence is mixed.The mechanism of action of black cohosh remains unclear. Research suggests that there may be no direct effects on estrogen receptors, although this is an area of active controversy.Safety and efficacy beyond one year have not been proven. Reports suggest the safety of short-term use, including in women with menopausal symptoms for whom estrogen replacement therapy is not suggested. Nonetheless, caution is advised until better-quality safety data are available. There have been reports of liver damage and higher lead levels in the blood from black cohosh. Use of black cohosh in high-risk populations (such as in women with a history of breast cancer) should be under the supervision of a licensed healthcare professional.'\n",
      " 'Beta-carotene is a carotenoid. Carotenoids are red, orange, or yellow, fat-soluble compounds. These compounds are naturally present in many fruits, grains, oils, and vegetables. Alpha, beta, and gamma carotene are considered provitamins because they can be converted to active vitamin A.Commercially available beta-carotene is man-made or taken from palm oil, algae, or fungi. Beta-carotene is converted to retinol, which is essential for vision and growth.Studies in humans show that beta-carotene has promising use for oral leukoplakia (pre-cancerous mouth lesions) and for sunburn. However there was a lack of benefit for sun damaged skin, mole prevention, heart disease risk, infection with H. Pylori, cataract prevention, diabetes, and stroke.Research shows that beta-carotene increased the risk of bladder, lung, stomach, and prostate cancer. Also the general incidence of cancer in asbestos workers, smokers, or high risk individuals increased. Additionally, some research suggested increased risk of heart disease and death with beta-carotene supplementation.'\n",
      " 'L-arginine was first isolated in 1886, reportedly from the extract of a lupine (Lupinus spp.) seedling. Lupinus is a genus in the legume (Fabaceae) plant family.Arginine is an amino acid normally made by the body. Arginine is also found in many foods that have protein.Arginine becomes nitric oxide (a blood vessel-widening agent called a vasodilator) in the body. Early evidence suggests that arginine may help treat medical conditions that improve with increased vasodilation. These conditions include chest pain, atherosclerosis (clogged arteries), heart disease, heart failure, erectile dysfunction, peripheral vascular disease, and headaches from blood vessel swelling).Arginine also triggers the body to make protein and has been studied for healing wounds, bodybuilding, enhancing sperm production, and preventing tissue wasting in people with critical illnesses. However, caution is warranted. Arginine use was associated with death in some people with heart conditions. Caution is also needed when using arginine to treat pre-eclampsia (high blood pressure in pregnancy).Arginine hydrochloride has been used to treat metabolic alkalosis. This use should be under the supervision of a qualified healthcare professional.'\n",
      " 'Flaxseed and flaxseed oil (or linseed oil) are rich sources of the essential fatty acid alpha-linolenic acid (ALA). In the body, some ALA is converted to omega-3 fatty acids.Lignans are a type of plant hormone similar to estrogen. The lignan components of flaxseed (not flaxseed oil) may possess antioxidant properties and alter estrogen activity.As a source of fiber, flaxseed (not flaxseed oil) has laxative properties. In large doses, or when taken without enough water, flaxseed may cause bowel obstruction. The effects of flaxseed on blood sugar levels are unclear.Flaxseed oil contains only the ALA component of flaxseed and not the fiber or lignan components. Therefore, flaxseed oil may share the potential cholesterol-lowering properties of flaxseed, but not the proposed laxative or anticancer abilities.'\n",

      " 'Tresorie - The Present Status of Radiation in the Treatment of Malignant\\nConditions [Present Status Of Radiation in the Treatment Of Malignant\\nConditions]\\n ISIDORE ARONS, M.D.\\n      \\n New York, N.Y.\\n      \\n AT A meeting of the American Medical\\n      Association recently held in Cleveland, Dr. Joseph C.Bloodgood, in\\n      discussing a paper on radiation therapy, said that \"report at my\\n      clinic told me that 49 per cent of the patients previously operated on in\\n      the clinic now to for radiotherapy. This is based on results. They are not\\n      hopeless cases; they are still hopeful and they get well under\\n      radiotherapy. This has happened during the last three years, not because I\\n      have changed any but because the method of radiotherapy has changed. A\\n      great change has taken place. First of all, radium and x-rays are no\\n      longer looked on a last resort.\".\\n      \\n The foregoing bears witness to the\\n      progress made in the field radiation therapy. The manufacture of more\\n      adequate apparatus and the improved technic in its use reflect this\\n      improvement. Machines are used generally delivering twenty to thirty\\n      milliamperes of current at 200 K.V., while machines operating at 750 to\\n      1,000 200 K.V., using lower milliamperes, have been installed in several\\n      places in this country. Since the question of increased voltages began to\\n      dominate the field, machines operating at 400 to 600 K.V., using sealed\\n      tubes, have been manufactured in this country as well as on the been\\n      manufactured in this country as well as on the continent. This higher\\n      powered machines occupy little more space than the usual 200 K.V. machine.\\n      \\n The effectiveness of these stronger\\n      radiations is thought to be due to (1) the increased penetration and its\\n      consequently larger percentage depth doses, (2) the supposed higher\\n      selective action of short have length radiation on malignant cells, and\\n      (3) greatly increased x-ray output. Clinics using super-voltages report\\n      that clinical results are somewhat better than those secured through the\\n      use of the lesser voltage machine.\\n      \\n Experimental effort, from the physical\\n      and biologic point of view, has been exerted to establish to standard\\n      basis for radiotherapy since Roentgens discovery thirtyfive years ago, and\\n      its application five years later. Radiotherapists have only recently begun\\n      to understand the principles of clinical application or radiotherapy in\\n      the treatment of malignant conditions.\\n      \\n Regaud selected the rabbits testicle\\n      for his experiments because its histologic cellular structure was highly\\n      sensitive to radiation, containing cells which are in a state of active\\n      mitosis resembling that of malignant tissue. In 1922, Regaud reported that\\n      of malignant, tissue. In 1922, Regaud reported that it was impossible to\\n      sterilize the testicle by a single dose of radiation without causing\\n      serious damage to the overlying skin. The dose required to produced such\\n      radio necrosis was equivalent to about three radionecrosis was equivalent\\n      to about three erythemas when administered in one dose. However, by\\n      dividing the dose in such a manner as to prolong the treatment over a\\n      period of fourteen days, a total dose of about five erythemas could be\\n      given causing complete sterilizations without damage to the skin. Thus it\\n      is seen that by prolonging the time of treatment the cutaneous dose could\\n      be increased nearly 50 per cent without causing necrosis.\\n      \\n The above experiments were reported,\\n      and the same results determined, by Schinz and Slotopolsky in 1926, and\\n      again by Regaud and Ferroux in 1927. These experiments formed the\\n      foundation for the clinical studies of Pfahler (America), Hohlfelder\\n      (Germany) and Coutard (France), who have swung the pendulum from massive\\n      radiation, as advocated by the German school, to that of the protected\\n      fractional dose method. Results have been achieved by this method which\\n      are superior to previously reported; these are obtained by the improved\\n      method of administering a large dose to the (3 days) without causing\\n      destructive effects to the surroundings normal structure (or cancer bed);\\n      its effect are rather biologic than physical. The clinical application of\\n      the method of radiation by Pfahler, Countard, and Berven (Sweden) in the\\n      treatment of cancer of the tonsil, pharynx and larynx and have proved the\\n      radio-sensitive properties of squamous carcinoma, previously considered\\n      incapable of of responding to radiation.\\n      \\n According to Coutard, the neoplasm is\\n      exposed to x-rays twice daily, giving a total dose of 350 r to400 r to two\\n      areas, using 190 to 200 k.v., four milliamperes, two millimeters of copper\\n      and three millimeters of aluminum filtration at a distance of fifty of\\n      sixty centimeters, for lesion of the head and neck. For deeply situated\\n      lesions, such as cancer of the uterus, the focal distance varies from 80\\n      to 100 centimeters, the area of the field for the head and neck conditions\\n      being only 50 to 100 square centimeters, while those of the lower abdomen\\n      require on an average of 250 to 300 square centimeters. For the\\n      sterilization of the radio-sensitive squamous carcinomatous growth, a\\n      depth dose of 3,000 r to 4,000 r is given, while stronger dose is\\n      necessary for the radio-resistant tumors.\\n      \\n In the course of treatment of principle\\n      guides a radio reaction of the covering epithelium and the radio reaction\\n      of the cancer cells. The radio reaction of the cutaneous epithelium is\\n      called \"radio epidermitis.\"characterized by loss of epithelial\\n      layers and denudation of the dermis. The reaction of the mucous membrane ,\\n      called \"radio epithelitis,\" manifests itself by loss of the\\n      epithelial layer sand denudation of the mucous membrane, epithelial layers\\n      and denudation of the corium which becomes covered by a fibrinous and\\n      false membrane; of clear. The duration of both describe radio reactions is\\n      six weeks. Each appears at the beginning of three weeks and disappears at\\n      the beginning of the ninth week.\\n      \\n Should the total or daily dose or the\\n      intensity per minute be too high, or the filtration or the tension too\\n      low, the cancer bed would be modified. the nutrition of the malignant\\n      cells becomes impaired The cellular radio- sensitivity, which seems to be\\n      linked up not only with the mitosis of the cell but above all with the\\n      activity of their interchange with the cell but above all with the\\n      activity of their interchange with the surrounding normal structures,\\n      becomes diminished and at times suppressed. The cancer cells become\\n      incentive to radiation. This phenomenon is called \"radio-\\n      vaccination\" by Regaud.\\n      \\n Observation of clinical facts shows\\n      that changes in the surrounding normal tissue result from excessive daily\\n      doses and intensity per minute per minute causing radio resistance of the\\n      tissue. Conversely, radio- sensitivity would be prolonged with a smaller\\n      daily dosage and the resultant extended period.\\n      \\n Realizing that better results may be\\n      obtained by prolonged treatment, Coutard and his collaborators in the last\\n      few years have begun to extend the duration of treatment of certain\\n      so-called radio-resistant cancers from thirty to ninety days, giving weak\\n      daily doses in order of about 175, 220, 225 and 250 r per day, dividing\\n      the dose in two treatments. By this method he was able to cure a certain\\n      number of lesions on which he had not been able previously to obtain the\\n      same results, such as very differentiated epidermoid epithelioma invading\\n      the muscles and cartilages, glandular epithelioma of the breast ad the\\n      thyroid body, and special round celled epitheliomas of the upper part of\\n      the ethmoid and the adjacent sinuses. This mode of prolonged treatment not\\n      only controlled the condition locally but it lessened the frequency of\\n      metastasis.\\n      \\n When radiating a cancer of very\\n      embryonic, very radio-sensitive growths, the energy factor is predominant.\\n      The action of the x-rays seems to be direct and rapid; the treatment can\\n      be accomplished within fifteen to twenty days. The cells are destroyed and\\n      generally normal structures are affected very little. When radiating the\\n      less embryonic type of growths, the time of treatment should be longer.\\n      \\n Pursuing these general principles, I\\n      have adopted the Countard method with some slight modifications. The cures\\n      which I shall illustrate will show that the percentage of cures in a\\n      number of most dangerous epidermoid carcinomas has markedly increased and\\n      that some conditions formerly considered hopeless have been temporarily\\n      cured. In conclusion I wish to emphasize the following facts:.\\n      \\n (1) Cure of cancer by x-rays is still\\n      difficult and must not be entered into lightly and causally.\\n      \\n (2) Radiotherapy is just as radical in\\n      method as surgery, and requires great skill, judgment and experience.\\n      \\n (3) The cooperation of the pathologist\\n      and the radiotherapist is imperative for a proper estimate of the\\n      radio-sensitivity in relation to treatment of the lesion.\\n      \\n (4) Daily examination of the patient is\\n      necessary; modification of the normal structure and general reaction by\\n      the x-ray treatment sometimes appears to quickly that it is often\\n      necessary to diminish the daily dose or the size of the field in the\\n      course of treatment.\\n      \\n (5) There exists no fixed method of\\n      treatment, only a simple clinical treatment for each individual patient\\n      and for the special type of tumor..\\n      \\n (6) Improvement in roentgen apparatus\\n      of higher voltages, producing more penetrating rays, will permit a better\\n      relation between destruction of malignant cells and preservation of the\\n      supporting, and the radio sensitivity of the tumor may be prolonged.'\n",

This is the city where\\n      Homoeopathy was first introduced by Rajendra Lal Dutta of hallowed memory,\\n      who spent a princely fortune for dissemination of its principles and\\n      practice among his countrymen. This is the city where took place the\\n      dramatic conversion of one of the then medical luminaries of the first\\n      magnitude, to the practice of Homoeopathy under the influence of Rajendra\\n      Lal. I mean Dr. Mahendra Lal Sircar who became the high priest of\\n      Homoeopathy, spread its glory far and wide and gained thereby an\\n      international reputation for himself. This is the city where the\\n      celebrities of Homoeopathy like Dr. Berigny, Dr. Salzar, Dr. P.C.\\n      Majumdar, Dr. D. N. Roy. Dr. Younan, Dr. J.N. Majumdar, Dr. Baridbaran\\n      Mukherji, Dr. S.K. Nag, Dr. A.N. Mukherji, Dr. T.N. Palit, Dr. G.\\n      Dirghangi and a host of other talented physicians practised their\\n      profession with credit and success and held aloft the banner of\\n      Homoeopathy. This is the city where exist pioneer institutions for the\\n      teaching of Homoeopathy. This is the city wherefrom Homoeopathy has spread\\n      to all parts of India and its votaries are doing yeomans service for the\\n      good of the suffering humanity.\\n      \\n We are meeting this evening on a\\n      historic occasion and we have to arrive at decisions which might make or\\n      mar the future history of Homoeopathy in India. It may be that forces of\\n      disruption, destruction and obstruction are at work; it may be that self\\n      and vested interests seem to thwart the smooth progress of Homoeopathy; it\\n      may be that some may seem to play in the hands of the Powers that are not\\n      too sympathetic to the cause of Homoeopathy; it may be that the present\\n      seems to be chaotic and future of Homoeopathy dubious but great is truth\\n      indeed and will prevail. We should not lose heart or throw up the sponge.\\n      Tradition, authority, sectarianism, dogmatism are great obstacles on the\\n      way. But obstacles and difficulties are meant to be fought out and\\n      overcome. Strifes and dissensions, discords and disunities may hamper our\\n      progress but they are nonetheless signs of lifes activities. It is a good\\n      augury that the Homoeopathic profession is shaking off its age - long\\n      slumber and getting more and more conscious of its duties and obligation,\\n      its rights and privileges and of its short - comings and practical\\n      difficulties. The life of Hahnemann is there to encourage us; the\\n      masterful will of his dynamic spirit is there to inspire us to intensify\\n      our activities; his achievements are there to goad us to realise greater\\n      success; and his personality is always before us to take lessons from, in\\n      our life which as Swami Vivekananda puts it, is \"a process of\\n      unfolding and development of a being under circumstances tending to press\\n      it down.\"\\n      \\n That Homoeopathy is a scientific system\\n      of treatment, philosophically sound, logically unimpeachable, practically\\n      highly efficacious in curing the sick and cheap enough to suit the poor\\n      economic condition of the Indian masses - has become a much talked - of\\n      subject in the country. But why is it not spreading sufficiently and\\n      adequately in our motherland or in fact anywhere in the world? Why is our\\n      National Government not still keen on according official recognition to\\n      this superb system of healing art or providing ways and means for its\\n      development and diffusion? Why the public opinion is not gaining strength\\n      enough to put sufficient pressure on our Government to take interest in\\n      it? Why sufficient number of fully equipped Homoeopathic teaching\\n      institutions and hospitals are not growing to turn out adequate number of\\n      fully qualified Homoeopathic physicians in the country?\\n      \\n It is high time that we should draw the\\n      attention of the profession and the laity to provide answers to so many\\n      \"whys\" and to solve the pressing problems in the matter\\n      concerned. On a cursory view it becomes evident that the Homoeopathic\\n      profession, the people and the Government are each individually and\\n      collectively responsible for this impasse.\\n      \\n The so - called Allopathy still\\n      occupies the dominant place in any country, even in the land of birth of\\n      Homoeopathy. It is no wonder that Homoeopathy, being a discovery of merely\\n      a century and a half still lags behind its rival shool. But it is a wonder\\n      of wonders that Homoeopathy has already encompassed the whole world within\\n      such a short period since it was ushered into existence by Hahnemann.\\n      History of man reveals that nowhere a new truth was accepted by him easily\\n      and readily, obsessed as he is with conservatism, tradition, authority and\\n      vested interests. Nonetheless the triumphant march of Homoeopathy with a\\n      such a meteoric speed throughout the length and breadth of the world is a\\n      proof positive of the truth inherent in the system and phenomenal\\n      therapeutic efficacy of this healing art. It is one more glaring instance\\n      of mans love of truth against heavy odds that impede his progress at every\\n      step.\\n      \\n For the propagation of any new truth\\n      and its acceptance by man, in general, the first and foremost condition is\\n      the turning out of sufficient number of persons who have realised the\\n      truth and are adept in the practice of it. This involves establishment of\\n      a sufficient number of teaching institutions which will turn out experts\\n      in the science and art of Homoeopathy; and a sufficient number of\\n      Homoeopathic Hospital where, the efficacy of this system of treatment will\\n      be put to test.\\n      \\n Human knowledge is becoming\\n      unmanageably vast. The appearance of specialists has become indispensable.\\n      So special Hospitals for the treatment of specific types of diseases have\\n      sprung forth elsewhere, e.g. Tuberculosis Hospitals, Cancer Hospitals,\\n      Hospital for Tropical Diseases etc. Because of organisation of these\\n      hospitals people generally think of getting themselves treated in these\\n      institutions. As there are no fully - equipped general Homoeopathic\\n      Hospitals and not to speak of special Homoeopathic Hospitals and not to\\n      speak of special Homoeopathic Hospitals the result is Homoeopathy is not\\n      getting a fair chance of treating those diseases like tuberculosis,\\n      cancer, acute infectious diseases of epidemic type e.g., Small-pox,\\n      Cholera etc. on a large and organised scale. Consequently the general\\n      public cannot keep much faith in this treatment and mostly take recourse\\n      to homoeopathic treatment when the case is \"past all hope and past\\n      all surgery\". Hence the establishment of fully - equipped\\n      Homoeopathic institutions (College - cum - Hospitals) is an imperative\\n      necessity for enhancing the prestige of the Homoeopathic profession and\\n      for convincing the people about the therapeutic efficacy of this system of\\n      treatment. Is it not a pity that Homoeopathy once established its\\n      reputation by treating Cholera cases in this city and now nobody thinks of\\n      this treatment in Cholera cases and rushes the patient to the Allopathic\\n      Hospitals which are especially meant for these types of patients? How can\\n      we hope to gain ground under these circumstances?\\n      \\n The next great obstacle is the apathy\\n      and in many cases active antagonism of our Government, both at the Centre\\n      and at least in some of the State, towards Homoeopathy. The Government is\\n      under the thumb of its medical directorates which are solely manned by\\n      Allopathic doctors. The main reasons for the non - acceptance of the\\n      Homoeopathic system of treatment may be summed up in three words:\\n      tradition, authority and professionalism. Their psychology is easily\\n      understood if it is borne in mind that the conservative inertia of human\\n      mind attempts to reject any new thought will all the means at its\\n      disposal. Another reason is due to vested interests. Even a cursory glance\\n      at the history of origin and spread of Homoeopathy, enables one to find\\n      out that the opposition to this system from the start, was not scientific\\n      but rather of commercial nature on the part of the apothecaries who were\\n      afraid of losing their trade - profits. We regret to note that the Central\\n      Government have not yet implemented a single recommendation put forward by\\n      the Homoeopathic Enquiry Committee, Planning Commission. Third Health\\n      Ministers Conference, Ad Hoc Committee etc. though Homoeopathic Acts have\\n      been passed in the States of Bombay, U.P., Madhya Pradesh, Travancore -\\n      Cochin, Bihar etc. I is curious to note that W. Bengal is the only State\\n      where a Homoeopathic Bill has recently been thrown out by the State\\n      Government.\\n      \\n Another great obstacle is the\\n      psychology of the general mass of population who fail to adopt a proper\\n      philosophical attitude towards Homoeopathy and takes the Homoeopathic\\n      Therapeutic Law as great paradox contrary to common sense. Unless we can\\n      educate the public in the matter, we cannot hope to secure their whole -\\n      hearted support for this system of treatment.\\n      \\n Lack of enthusiasm for constructive\\n      works on the part of the Homoeopathic profession, the apathy of our\\n      Government and hesitancy on the part of the public to accept Homoeopathy\\n      are great obstacles to the spread of this system of treatment in the\\n      country. Unless this vicious circles is broken the progress of Homoeopathy\\n      is bound to be impeded. We have to fight on all fronts if we aspire to\\n      achieve victory in our battle for the cause of Homoeopathy and the\\n      suffering humanity.\\n      \\n But our first necessity as pointed out\\n      by the Soul of India expressing itself through Sri Aurobindo, is: If India\\n      is to survive and do her appointed work in the world, the youth of India\\n      should learn to think, to think on all subjects, to think independently,\\n      fruitfully, going to the heart of things, not stopped by their surface,\\n      free of pre - judgements, shearing sophism and prejudice asunder as with a\\n      sharp sword smiting down obscurantism of all kinds as with a mace of\\n      Bhima.\\n      \\n \"Let our brains no longer, like\\n      European infants, be swathed with swaddling clothes; let it have recover\\n      the free and unbound motion of the Gods, let it have not only the\\n      minuteness but the wide mastery and sovereignty natural to the intellect\\n      of Bharata and easily recoverable by it if it once accustomes itself to\\n      feel its own power and be convinced of its own worth.\\n      \\n \"The old fixed foundations have\\n      been broken up, we are tossing in the waters of a great upheaval and\\n      change.

      " 'Tresorie - SOME OBSERVATIONS ON NEURASTHENIA AND ITS TREATMENT\\n[Neurasthenia & Treatment]\\n\\n WHEN, thirty-five years ago, the writer\\n      first made the acquaintance of what is now called neurasthenia, it was\\n      known as spinal irritation, and the best of modern researches have been\\n      unable to give a better definition beyond a functional disturbance of the\\n      spinal and cerebral nerves, dependent on a morbid process, for which\\n      \"irritation\" is as proper a term as any. As deaths do not occur,\\n      autopsies throw no light on the subject. Briefly stated, neurasthenia,\\n      when observed from the beginning through its chronic course, has a period\\n      of prodromal symptoms followed by a protracted acute, and succeeded by a\\n      still more protracted chronic, state, between the end of which and the\\n      beginning of convalescence there is a very vague, often indiscernible,\\n      boundary line.\\n      \\n The prodromal symptoms are quite\\n      indefinite and very variable, pointing to nothing in particular. Loss of\\n      appetite, irregular sleep, excitability alternating with lassitude, etc.,\\n      are often overlooked, especially when the second stage-display of unusual\\n      mental and physical energy without subsequent fatigue- becomes apparent.\\n      This is often mistaken for a sign of unusually good health. When a young\\n      girl or mature woman, married or unmarried, feels that she can study ten\\n      hours a day and devote half of her night to pleasure or business; when\\n      besides much mental occupation she begins to rejoice in long walks without\\n      fatigue, that is the time when the mischief is going on without exciting\\n      timely suspicion. Relief is at last sought when the functional disorder of\\n      the nerves has gone to the opposite extreme, and becomes manifest in what\\n      is properly and popularly termed \"nervous prostration,\" when\\n      instead of having no sense of fatigue, the best bodily or mental effort\\n      seems intolerable, in grave cases rendering the patient a helpless being,\\n      completely dependent on the unremitting assistance of others whom she )it\\n      is usually a woman) rules with the inexorable power of the vis inertiae.\\n      \\n During this usually very protracted\\n      period of the disease convalescence usually sets in, but so imperceptibly\\n      that the physician alone can sometimes estimate its progress, which is\\n      unnoticeable to others towards whom the patient acts as she has for months\\n      or years. This is the time for action, too often delayed from motives of\\n      misplaced sympathy on the part of relatives and friends.\\n      \\n The affections is in many instances\\n      limited to the spine, the mind becoming only secondarily tired. In other\\n      cases it is spinal and cerebral; in others again chiefly cerebral. The\\n      line between this and insanity is always clearly definable. Though a\\n      neurasthenic patient may become insane, and probably the reverse, yet both\\n      are distinct conditions.\\n      \\n Books speak of this disease at common\\n      to men and women. Yet in this region in small towns as well as in large\\n      cities the cases of neurasthenia in women are preponderatingly great.\\n      \\n Hypochondriacs and hysteria stand in\\n      peculiar relation to neurasthenia. They maybe regarded as different\\n      species of the same genus; that is, more or less deeply seated\\n      disturbances of the cerebro-spinal system in which the sympathetic system\\n      is probably indirectly involved, as many functional disturbances presided\\n      over by the great sympathetic system often testify. Hypochondriasis, pure\\n      and simple as occurring in men, is easily distinguishable by its striking\\n      characteristic of introspection and despondency, occasioned by abnormal\\n      sensations, without marked physical weakness and tiredness. Pure\\n      hypochondriacs are often energetic, conscientious workers. In hysteria\\n      there is neither great tiredness nor tendency to introspection, but a\\n      paroxysmal or prolonged absence of the power of self control, in grave\\n      cases associated with tonic or clonic muscular spasm and loss of\\n      consciousness. While neurasthenia in its uncomplicated forms is free from\\n      these symptoms, but, as ample experience teaches, often complicated with\\n      both of the preceding forms to such an extent that it is often very\\n      difficult to tell which is primary and which secondary. The symptoms known\\n      as introspection, hysterical aberrations of the emotions, and neurasthenic\\n      sense of exhaustion are in their distinctive manifestations most important\\n      and constitute indications in the selection of remedial and dietetic\\n      measures.\\n      \\n The following are some observation of\\n      peculiarities observed in a large number of cases and peculiar to all:.\\n      \\n Introspection.-The neurasthenic patient\\n      in variably expresses her desire for relief, not so much in a direct\\n      appeal as in a supplicating, subdued tone of voice and manner. She rarely\\n      asks, \"What can you do to relieve me?\" but almost invariably,\\n      \"What is the cause of\" this or that sensation? If she is\\n      introspective, that is, hypochondriacal, she becomes a nosomaniac,\\n      watching acutely every one of her numerous distressing sensation, on the\\n      unremitting analysis of which her mind dwells. In marked cases she is\\n      quite unable to think of anything outside of herself, and in many cases\\n      dislikes to do so, preferring to river her attention on herself. Attempts\\n      to divert her annoy or anger her. Friends and relatives implore the\\n      physician to divert the patient, but all their attempts are in vain\\n      because quite misdirected.\\n      \\n Positive and Negative Will.-It seems\\n      sometimes as if the patient delights in her self-inspection, and that she\\n      prefers her condition to speedy recovery. This is not the case, for the\\n      patient will always assure the physician of her wish to get well. During\\n      the acute stage-a long yet definable period-this wish and longing cannot\\n      well be utilized, but the long and ill-defined period of convalescence\\n      must first be awaited. Here we shall always discover that the wish and the\\n      will of the patient are two very different mental conditions. The desire\\n      or wish for recovery is entirely unattended by any will effort to\\n      accomplish the desired end. The injunctions and directions of the\\n      physician are resisted by the same unconquerable power of negative power,\\n      or vis inertiae. The patient having been unable to exert her will, now\\n      thinks herself unable to use it.\\n      \\n Numerous Symptoms of Patients.-To\\n      physicians in search of indications for medicines each statement of\\n      patient concerning a sensation is apt to be considered as a symptom. Many\\n      years ago, when resolved to get at the keynote of a patient\\'s case, the\\n      writer determined to allow the patient to detail all her symptoms as long\\n      as she chose and to take accurate notes of each one till the right one\\n      should be disclosed; and this was to be done regardless of time and\\n      exertion. The patient, one who needed no urging to describe her\\n      \"symptoms,\" began in an almost inaudible voice, detailing one\\n      sensation after another with an unrivalled degree of clearness and\\n      vividness of expression; as she proceeded the voice became stronger, her\\n      face slightly flushed, and the most perfect descriptive language flowed in\\n      an endless stream. Each word was written down, page after page was filled;\\n      still she went on with unmistakable signs of satisfaction at being able to\\n      pour her pent-up emotions into willing and sympathetic ears. If, for a\\n      moment, the flow of language was interrupted, a simple question would\\n      re-animate her to proceed with renewed energy. Feelings seemed to beget\\n      feelings; their complexity gave the patient no trouble; her intellect was\\n      equal to the action of unraveling the most complicated sensation,\\n      separating them into their component parts and spreading them out before\\n      the mind of the listener. A glance at the watch showed that nearly two\\n      hours had passed, during which the feeblest of neurasthenic patients had\\n      talked incessantly. The note-book was full, the keynote was found. It was\\n      this: neurasthenic patients have innumerable sensation and exhibit no\\n      sings of fatigue after talking incessantly for nearly two hours.\\n      \\n Great Endurance of Neurasthenics.-The\\n      instance just related, which is one of many, illustrates two things. One\\n      is, that it is not the kind of sensation described but the fact that\\n      neurasthenics have innumerable sensations, that constitute the symptoms.\\n      The other thing is that many neurasthenics are capable of great exertion\\n      without suffering disagreeable after- effects from fatigue. This is\\n      illustrated by other cases of which I have notes. A highly neurasthenic\\n      young lady consented to camp out for her health near a lake. She was\\n      induced to join a party for a short walk along the lake. By trying what\\n      they thought a shorter road the party lost their way and took a very long\\n      walk of about four hours, through bogs and over forces. The neurasthenic\\n      was less fatigued than some of the others. The interesting observation was\\n      subsequently made that the patient had become interested in a young man of\\n      the party. She recovered her health within a year from that time. Other\\n      cases of this kind will appear under the head of therapeutic suggestions.\\n      \\n Neurasthenic Patients Crave\\n      Sympathy.-This is one of the most formidable obstacles to the curative\\n      management of such cases, for the kind of sympathy such patients crave is\\n      expressions of condolence and more or less deep affliction at so much\\n      suffering as the patient expresses. Such sympathy is most natural and does\\n      honor to the feelings of parents, sisters, brothers and husbands, but it\\n      is unfortunate that the deeper their expression of affliction so much the\\n      more profound will be the mental dejection and weakness of the patient.\\n      Almost every case which has come under the writer\\'s observation has been\\n      much hampered if not made hopeless by this condition of things, against\\n      which no remedy suggests itself that would not be construed as\\n      \"unkind\".\\n      \\n The origin of this very formidable and\\n      refractory nervous disease, like that of most diseases usually termed\\n      chronic, is either hereditary or acquired, as the histories of every\\n      observed case plainly testify. Either the father was a hypochondriac or\\n      the mother neurasthenic, or both parents were of unsound nervous\\n      constitution. Dipsomania on the part of parents produces neurasthenia in\\n      the children, as readily as it will be followed by any other form of\\n      nervous disease, according to the individual predisposition of the\\n      offspring. The excessive use of tea and coffee is another very active\\n      factor in the history of neurasthenics. Where fathers inclined to alcohol,\\n      mothers are addicted to tea and coffee, which, while its immediate effects\\n      do not obtrude themselves upon our notice, are none the less insidious in\\n      their more remote consequences.\\n      \\n The acquired forms of neurasthenia are\\n      of utmost interest to the therapeutist, and the sources of acquisition are\\n      readily stated. They are much brain-work with insufficient food and sleep.\\n      Such conditions obtain chiefly in women (less frequently in men) of fine\\n      intellectual ability, conscientiousness and ambition. Physical overwork\\n      with unintellectual women has no such effect. Quite analogous to the above\\n      are the conditions of care and sorrow, especially in women who are able\\n      for a long time to conceal and control their emotions. The usual\\n      consequence of such states of mind is disregard of food and insufficient\\n      sleep. Instances of acquired neurasthenia are presented in families of\\n      several girls and boys, where one or more of the former are Neurasthenic\\n      while the latter are vigorous and athletic. Boys delighting in vigorous\\n      exercise do not, as is the case with girls, lose appetite and sleep.\\n      \\n The effects of nervous exhaustion in\\n      boys are usually much less grave than in girls; as a rule such effects are\\n      manifested in mental, not muscular, tiredness, and they are relieved by\\n      air and exercise, while in girls and women those influences are shunned\\n      because they seem to increase the tiredness.\\n      \\n Predisposition-The temperament, or what\\n      in modern pharaseology is called the personal equation, plays a visible\\n      but uncontrollable part in the progress of neurasthenia, as temperament\\n      greatly determines the other imperfectly known condition known as\\n      predisposition. Where the disease is hereditary, it is easy to say that\\n      the predisposition is due to that source; where there is no history of\\n      heredity and where neurasthenia exists in the last members of a\\n      generation, it may be attributed to acquired predisposition which needed\\n      only the exciting cause to establish the disease in its most typical form.\\n      \\n One of the most common forms of\\n      neurasthenia, often quite intractable, results from a serious defect in\\n      our public school system, one which affects chiefly girls from twelve to\\n      fourteen years of age. The following is a brief example: The child rises\\n      late with no appetite for breakfast and no time to eat it if so inclined.\\n      The lessons, however, have been learned the evening before, and the school\\n      work is begun with an ambitions will and a crammed mind, and continues\\n      with one intermission of often not more than ten minutes or three of four\\n      hours. The pupil arrives at home ravenously hungry, eats too fast, and too\\n      much of injudiciously prepared food, too long in digesting to leave room\\n      for an appetite for even a light evening meal, or even for a breakfast the\\n      next morning.\\n      \\n In another case the girl or boy grows\\n      desperately hungry while at school, but being unprovided with food\\n      (lunch), goes on with the school exercises, at the end of which the sense\\n      of hunger has vanished and has been replaced by an aversion to normal\\n      food, with a possible craving for something pungent and indigestible. This\\n      observation can easily be made in many instances, and will, in as many\\n      cases, be seen to lead to nervous prostration, which is then treated by\\n      vile, patented concoctions consisting largely of whiskey, under the name\\n      of \"tonics,\" while the patient needs only the best that a\\n      legitimate market affords prepared in a sensible manner.\\n      \\n Typical Cases Ending in Rapid\\n      Recovery.-Curative results have already been indicated in what has been\\n      said above, and further indications for treatment may be gathered from a\\n      few cases of extremely rapid recovery of apparently incurable cases, to\\n      which brief allusion will here be made. A woman of forty had been a victim\\n      of grave neurasthenia for five years. In the absence of an inclination to\\n      exert himself, she had, during that period, been mostly confined to her\\n      bed or lounge, in the meantime giving birth to two children, going through\\n      gestation and confinement normally, without recovering from neurasthenic\\n      prostration which, in the course of some years more, rendered her entirely\\n      helpless. Her condition was associated with a feeling of dropping to\\n      pieces unless supported and braced by a harness of wood, iron and leather,\\n      in which she \"sat up\" for several hours each day, spending the\\n      rest of the time in bed. Having left the patient in this condition, it was\\n      reported before the writer\\'s next professional visit that Mrs.-had been\\n      cured, and that she was able to go out like other people. A visit to the\\n      house confirmed the report. The patient came to the door herself, and in a\\n      quiet manner, entirely without the least expression of joy or wonder at\\n      her release, stated, that having heard of a famous \"magnetic\\n      physician,\" she summoned him, was ordered by him to arise and stand;\\n      protesting that it was impossible, she was raised to her feet and again\\n      ordered to stand, then to walk. Fearing that she would fall, she begged\\n      the magnetic doctor to support her, which he peremptorily refused, saying\\n      she might fall if she liked. Instead of falling, she had to walk about the\\n      room, was then placed upon a lounge and subjected to a severe treatment of\\n      rolling and pummelling, and then ordered to dress and sit up until tired,\\n      to remain up and about like other people, and to call on the doctor in\\n      future, as he would not come so far to the patient again. This happened\\n      about twenty-five years ago, and the patient has been in very fair health\\n      arrested by insisting that all professional visits by the writer or any\\n      other physician to whose sympathy the patient could appeal must cease.\\n      This injunction was carried out conscientiously with the best results by\\n      the husband of the patient. Perhaps we may learn from this that sometimes,\\n      at least, the familiar motto is reversed, and angels rush in where fools\\n      fear to tread.\\n      \\n Profiting by this experience, another\\n      neurasthenic woman, unmarried, but of most intractable, antagonistic\\n      temperament, confined to her bed, in and out of hospitals, for years,\\n      wearing out the strength and means of her relatives and the patience of\\n      many physicians, was at length abandoned by them. It was a case of spinal\\n      and cerebral neurasthenia complicated with hypochondriasis in its most\\n      trying form of introspective maunderings and endless description of\\n      symptoms. She tormented her advisers by her endless tirades, the\\n      indulgence of which invariably aggravated her condition, and were there\\n      fore avoided, until once her physician yielded to the patient\\'s\\n      importunities for a visit, when be found her in her usual abject state of\\n      prostration. Guided by experience derived from cases like the one first\\n      described, he assisted the patient to her feet and marched her, will you\\n      nil you, up and down the room until he, at least, was thoroughly tired,\\n      and then departed with the promise never to do so again. The patient, on\\n      her part, made a number of her unnameable promises, but kept on her feet\\n      and let the doctors alone. Though not cured of deeply-rooted morbid mental\\n      faults, the neurasthenic phase of her condition had yielded to the change\\n      of the antagonistic element of her character from passive to very\\n      practical activity. A third very serious case of this kind occurred in the\\n      person of a girl of fifteen, of selfish character, who gradually became\\n      bed-ridden with spinal and cerebral neurasthenia, and tormented with the\\n      usual multifarious painful sensations, none of which, on the most\\n      pains-taking physical examination, resulted from demonstrable organic\\n      disease of genital or abdominal organs. The patient was most tenderly\\n      cared for by her mother, who, in the course of years, became so imbued\\n      with the idea of yielding to every wish and whim of the patient, that at\\n      length remonstrance became useless. The mother, though recognizing the\\n      importance of persuading or urging her daughter to depend more on herself,\\n      admitted that she had yielded so long that now she must continue to feed,\\n      dress and assist her charge in the most trivial things. Her food had to be\\n      placed in her mouth, the position of a hand or foot changed by some one\\n      else, although patient did so spontaneously when she chose. This went on\\n      for fifteen years, when the mother, growing old and feeble, died. Her\\n      maternal support being gone, the patient at once proved her ability to\\n      walk, to dress, to feed herself, and to seek light employment. Though far\\n      from well, she is equally far fro being a helpless, bed-ridden invalid.\\n      \\n A fourth case, still very vividly\\n      impressed on the writer\\'s mind, was one of a healthy, romping girl of 14,\\n      who, as happen in this remarkably capricious disease, in the midst of\\n      perfect health, one day took to her bed and remained there with all the\\n      symptoms of neurasthenia, involving first the spinal and finally the\\n      cerebral nerves. This patient was very amiable, conscientious, and\\n      sensible, never loquacious, and not troubled with hypochondriacal thoughts\\n      or sensations. Tiredness was the only expression she used in describing\\n      her feelings. There was literally no variation from this condition, which\\n      confined her to her bed for years, till she grew from a girl to a woman.\\n      Eating and sleeping well, and improving perceptibly in personal appearance\\n      and character, yet she lay on her couch tired and watched over with\\n      unremitting care by a most anxious mother, showing her solicitude and\\n      sympathy in every feature. Once, in the second year of the disease, a\\n      favorable interruption occurred. The mother, still a young woman, gave\\n      birth to another child. During her confinement the neurasthenic patient\\n      was in charge of her mother\\'s nurse, assisted by other servants. The\\n      nurse, while devoted to the daughter, agreed with the writer that excess\\n      of sympathy was injurious, and used her best and judicious endeavors\\n      gradually to persuade the patient to make some physical effort at walking\\n      and standing. In this she was so successful that in two weeks she\\n      accompanied the girl on half-mile walks up and down hill, finally without\\n      assistance. Thus, recovery seemed assured, and everything was favorable\\n      progressing towards it when the mother, having fully recovered, again took\\n      charge of her daughter, with the result that she at once took to her\\n      lounge and remained there two years longer. About that time other advice\\n      was urged and gladly acceded to, with the result that the case was\\n      diagnosed by an eminent surgeon as spinal paralysis in consequence of\\n      concussion, though it could never be shown when and where it occurred.\\n      Salves, plasters, anodynes, nervines, and electricity did no good, but\\n      effectually destroyed appetite and digestion, which higher to had been\\n      normal. So this adviser resigned in favor of a third, who, being a younger\\n      and less prejudiced man, agreed perfectly with the writer\\'s original\\n      opinion. He advised return to moderate exercise, avoidance of drugs, and\\n      less display of sympathy. This, though formerly rejected as\\n      \"unkind,\" was now acceded to as coming from a nerve- specialist,\\n      fresh from Europe, at that time very rare. Still attending the other\\n      members of the family, the writer had sample opportunity of observing the\\n      course of the case. Improvement was very slow and uncertain till financial\\n      misfortune overtook the family. Almost with a bound our patient left her\\n      cough, and, organizing a kindergarten, strove energetically in supporting\\n      herself and assisting her mother. The change came about in less than three\\n      weeks, and resulted in perfect recovery.\\n      \\n At this point another very instructive\\n      case of very speedy recovery, after six or seven years of neurasthenic\\n      prostration, deserves to be mentioned. A woman of 35 had been in bed and\\n      on the lounge most of the time for nearly seven years, at the end of which\\n      time she became my patient, her regular medical attendant having gone to\\n      Europe. She was of very amiable disposition and as sensitive as she was\\n      weak. Her symptoms, as in the other cases, were instantaneous exhaustion\\n      on the least physical exertion. She could give herself up to no mental\\n      occupation beyond directing her house-hold affairs, the education of her\\n      son, and the rehearsal of her numerous sensations. She had not been my\\n      patient long when her husband failed in business, so that the family was\\n      reduced from very comfortable circumstances to a condition which made it\\n      necessary for the patient to make her own living and that of the family.\\n      This she almost at once proceeded to do, setting aside all other\\n      considerations and establishing a boarding-house, where she did most of\\n      the work herself. This she has done now for ten or twelve years without a\\n      serious relapse. The time involved in the period of convalescence was\\n      scarcely more than three weeks, a although her work maybe said to have\\n      begun at the moment her resolution was taken.\\n      \\n Prognostics.-From these and other cases\\n      in and outside of the writer\\'s practice, it is safe to say that the\\n      majority of cases of neurasthenia recover, though years may elapse before\\n      that period. We learn, furthermore, that recoveries, especially of very\\n      inveterate cases, depend on conditions beyond the control of the\\n      physician, as was the case in the above-recorded instances, where\\n      circumstances forced the patient to cases to wish for recovery and to make\\n      an effort of the will. This having been once accomplished self-confidence,\\n      for a long time in abeyance, was permanently restored.\\n      \\n Curability, further, depends very much\\n      on the temperament of the patient, whether amiable, tractable and\\n      confiding in the honest endeavors of the physician, or whether refractory,\\n      suspicious, untruthful, selfish and antagonistic, of a disposition\\n      impossible to win over on account of unnatural distrust of every\\n      well-meaning person. The degree of intelligence of patients also has a\\n      pronounced influence on the result. The most readily curable cases are\\n      those acquired without hereditary predisposition, where the cause is found\\n      in the absence of food and sleep, also where sorrow and anxiety can be\\n      averted or counteracted by judicious conduct of near relatives and\\n      friends.\\n      \\n Dietetic Treatment.-This, as medicinal\\n      treatment, must be governed by the stage at which the case comes into the\\n      physician\\'s hands-whether yet in its prodromal, its acute or its chronic\\n      phase. The prodromal stage of the disease has no very decided\\n      pathognomonic signs. The most that can be recognized in this stage is that\\n      the patient\\'s habits or duties are of a kind which will eventually lead to\\n      obdurate neurasthenia if not arrested in time by removing the exciting\\n      causes. Too much pleasure, as well as too much care, especially in girls\\n      and woman, tends to neglect of food and rest, in the absence of which,\\n      excitements, whether of pleasure or care, begets a state of unrest in\\n      which repose is disagreeable. With such a condition comes a list of\\n      incipient casual complaints of headache, imperfect sleep, notional ways of\\n      eating, working or playing. A few questions will determine whether the\\n      patient is living according to normal or abnormal habits with regard to\\n      appetite, sleep and occupation. Where these are found, their alteration to\\n      normal ways must be instead on. It is unnecessary to say that this is\\n      easier said than done, for it will probably meet with serious objections\\n      on the part of the patient, if not on that of her relatives; for most\\n      likely she has examinations for college to prepare for, involving several\\n      months of dose and careful study at night, and the patient cannot waste\\n      time in sleeping and eating while cramming that little excited and\\n      ambitions brain. A failure in the examinations would be as much of a\\n      disappointment to parents as to patient, who proves, as usual, that this\\n      appellation is a misnomer. She accordingly goes in as she please, lied by\\n      an increasing morbidly ambitions impulse, and the result is likely to be\\n      the mournful satisfaction on the part of the physician of being obliged to\\n      say, \"I told you before what would happen.\" Of course, all\\n      regret the now evident nerve-prostration, while, if the doctor had\\n      succeeded in enforcing his rules, he would in many cases experience the\\n      still more painful reproach of having been too severe. Nevertheless,\\n      absolute firmness and a kindly but unflinching exertion of his will,\\n      without the least compromise, reward the physician with the best results\\n      in such cases.\\n      \\n When the case, after the stage of\\n      excitement and untiring restlessness (at which it would still be speedily\\n      curable by simple dietetic rules) has, after weeks or months, entered upon\\n      the phase of painful prostration, here we encounter backache, oppressive\\n      headache, and absolute loss of mental or bodily endurance, measures of\\n      dietetic management are much less effective and much more difficult to\\n      find. it is at this stage that slight rise of temperature will occur,\\n      especially towards evening; then the backache and headache disappear, the\\n      pallor is replaced by a flush of color, the eyes lose their listless look,\\n      and the patient is inclined to enter upon some diversion or excitement,\\n      followed by a restless night and a morning of exhaustion and a renewal of\\n      all painful sensations. Most of such patients feel much better in the\\n      evening when they are ready for some entertainment, while in a normal\\n      state this would be the time for relaxation and repose.\\n      \\n The dietetic treatment of this stage is\\n      methodical rest. In severe cases the patient will do well to remain in bed\\n      for several days or even for weeks. It is well to shorten this period as\\n      much as possible and to insist on walking about, or, at least. sitting for\\n      a specified time every day. This may be varied b equally specified periods\\n      of rest in the recumbent position.\\n      \\n Irregularities of eating are at this\\n      and at all times to be superseded by the most rigid regularity of meals.\\n      The traditional and conventional three-meal system, however well adapted\\n      to the needs of a vigorous man or woman, does not agree with the\\n      neurasthenic patient. It is much better that these should eat oftener;\\n      four times a day is best in most cases, for the simple reason that in this\\n      way a patient, while eating less at a time, consumes more food in the\\n      aggregate.\\n      \\n As neurasthenic patients are rarely\\n      troubled with absolute aversion to wholesome food, they are generally able\\n      to consume a liberal quantity, about which it is only needful to remark\\n      here that the food should be selected from among the articles and dishes\\n      which the patient likes, provided they belong to the order of good, normal\\n      articles of food, to the exclusion of those which simply please the taste\\n      without being digestible. A dish entirely of meat or \"animal\\n      food\" is as far from being a good diet for neurasthenics as one\\n      consisting entirely of \"vegetable\" food. As a rule, the diet\\n      list should comprise one-third of nitrogenous material and two-thirds of\\n      carbohydrates. Together with these, it is a great mistake to neglect the\\n      fats, such as good butter and the fats of meats. And, lastly, every\\n      patient of this kind should be made to drink some water often, a dietetic\\n      feature too often neglected.\\n      \\n During this stage, actually fatiguing\\n      exercise of body and mind should be avoided, while, on the other hand, the\\n      patient\\'s mind should be directed away from herself, in which she is much\\n      assisted by withholding a certain kind of emotional sympathy, quite as\\n      natural as it is difficult to repress on the part of affectionate persons.\\n      Of this, a few words further on.\\n      \\n There is no definite time for the\\n      duration of this stage, which, however, depends largely on the time during\\n      which the exciting causes have acted, either aided by or without a\\n      predisposition. It is certain, however, that the sooner it is recognized\\n      and the exciting causes eliminated, so much the sooner recovery will\\n      begin. But there is a stage at which the best of experience and judgment\\n      often fail, especially in very inveterate cases. If the case is one of a\\n      patient whom the physician has had opportunity of watching at least since\\n      the earlier stages, the difficulty is not so great as it is in old cases\\n      months or even of several years\\' duration which come to treatment late. In\\n      these, the line between the intermediate stage and incipient convalescence\\n      cannot be drawn. The patient is as neurasthenic and hypochondriacal as\\n      ever; cannot bear the slightest mental or bodily exertion, not even a word\\n      or a look, without sings of apparent exhaustion, while nearly the whole\\n      time is spent in bed under anxious care of sympathetic attendants. In such\\n      cases, having become assured, by careful physical examination, of the\\n      absence of organic disease, seeing the patient generally well nourished\\n      and in fair muscular condition, the physician is warranted in assuming\\n      that the disease has run its course, that whatever morbid (pathological)\\n      process there may have been progressing in the nervous system, this\\n      process has now come to and end, but it has left the patient\\'s mental\\n      condition habituated to the moods of the past months or years, and fixed,\\n      as it were, indelibly in the memory. It is the habit that now remains, not\\n      the disease.\\n      \\n If reasonably sure of this, and calling\\n      to mind the rapid recoveries and the circumstances attending them, as\\n      above detailed, the physician is now safe in ordering a more energetic\\n      treatment, calculated to rouse the self-reliance of the patient. All\\n      visible signs of sympathy must now be set aside; the actins and demeanor\\n      of the attendants should, from this time, if not before, be changed so as\\n      to give the patient the impression that she is no longer an invalid, but\\n      expected to rely on her own exertion. Instead of being fed, the food\\n      should be placed where she must go for and eat it. She should now be\\n      expected to dress and attend, without assistance, to her natural wants.\\n      This, with some temperaments, is almost impossible, with al extremely\\n      difficult. The best course to pursue is to remove such patients from\\n      sympathetic relatives or friends, and to place them in charge of kind,\\n      reliable, but eminently practical nurses.\\n      \\n The first effect of this is either to\\n      throw the patient into a stage of helpless despondency, which, again\\n      appealing powerfully to the sympathies of those nearest to her, often\\n      frustrates the physician\\'s plans which, if firmly but kindly adhered to,\\n      would, ere long, prove of their superiority by signs of returning\\n      self-reliance and absence of complaints on the part of the patient. A\\n      second form of effect is that occurring in patients of obstreperous,\\n      selfish disposition, whose opposition and even anger is aroused by being\\n      thrown on their own resources after the removal of depressing and\\n      unpractical sympathy. This opposition or temper, often manifested in all\\n      sorts of intrigues and subterfuges on the part of the patient, if not\\n      supinely yielded to by sympathetic persons, will finally be replaced by a\\n      more rational disposition. On the whole, anger or active opposition are\\n      signs of returning energy, which, once coming to the consciousness of the\\n      patient, takes the form of self- reliance. it is this way that the cures\\n      of chronic cases above related can be explained, and physicians should\\n      profit by such experience for the benefit of their patients.\\n      \\n The general dietetic management now\\n      readily follows from what has been said, and needs only a few general\\n      modifications. The first duty of the physician will be to test the degree\\n      of reliance to be placed on the patient and her friends, ad to win them\\n      over if possible to his plans, and his success will be in proportion to\\n      the degree of confidence he is able to inspire. This personal confidence\\n      should not degenerate into a mere personal liking or attachment of a\\n      sympathy-craving neurasthenic who should discover henceforth that all\\n      sentimental expressing of sympathy are about to take a practical form,\\n      aiming at a definite result-the patient\\'s health-which she wishes but\\n      cannot exert her will to attain. The best and often the only way to do\\n      away with sentiment and to reach practical kindness is to remove the\\n      patient from certain home influence, and to place her in a hospital or\\n      elsewhere under the management of competent nurses who, without being\\n      selfish, know how to exert a certain amount of wholesome push as fast as\\n      the patient can bear it. Without the removal of sentimental sympathy, all\\n      efforts at counteracting the purely hypochondriacal side of neurasthenia\\n      are useless.\\n      \\n In these cases of neurasthenia as yet\\n      uncomplicated with the hypochondriacal element of introspective nosomania,\\n      there is only one unconditional rule to be followed, especially in\\n      acquired cases whose evident cause was incessant, conscientious work of\\n      mind and body, together with insufficient food and sleep. Such cases come\\n      on very insidiously, the loss of strength-that is, the actual waste of\\n      nerve-substance-being just a trifle grater than the quantity restored, the\\n      patient unconsciously using up a minute part of her capital every day.\\n      Here the rule should be to reverse matters to insuring a supply of\\n      nourishment and time for its assimilation greater than was the case\\n      heretofore. The case of young school-girls belong in this class. The time\\n      of food and rest should be carefully controlled at home, the duty of the\\n      physician being to educate indifferent and ignorant parents up to an\\n      appreciation of the nature of the case. It is generally not difficult to\\n      open their eyes through the medium of their anxiety concerning their\\n      children\\'s health. Having thus insured sufficient rest and food at home,\\n      the physician\\'s next object of attention should be the regulations of the\\n      school. Here is the point where teachers have an opportunity of exerting\\n      their most practical influence. It should be made obligatory on the part\\n      of teachers to institute inquiry as to whether pupils have had their meals\\n      before coming to school. This they could often ascertain without a\\n      question, by reading the pupil\\'s condition in her emaciated form, pale\\n      face and nervous manner. To guard against neglect at home, it would be an\\n      easy matter to insist that all pupils of public and private schools should\\n      bring with them some proper food. The few who do so generally bring\\n      sweets-an apple, orange or a few dry crackers-when a piece of good bread\\n      and slice of cold meat would be what they actually need. All pupils should\\n      pass inspection, and if remiss in this important particular, the\\n      delinquent should be dismissed with several marks against her. To expect\\n      this of teachers would be a great advance in the place of futile\\n      innovations of endeavoring to send forth from our common schools graduates\\n      in arts and sciences.\\n      \\n Sudden Effects.-A large number of cases\\n      of neurasthenia, especially those complicated with inveterate\\n      Hypochondriasis, are frequently traced to some sudden occurrence, having\\n      the effect of a mental or physical shock. In one patient, a vigorous girl,\\n      used to romping, climbing and running lie a boy, the cause was supposed to\\n      be a slight thump she received during a game of blindman\\'s-buff. She\\n      thought nothing of it at the time, but it was suggested long after the\\n      patient\\'s illness began. In another case some mental shock of joy or\\n      grief, not very severe and such as is often experienced in every person\\'s\\n      life, is the beginning of months of nervous prostration.\\n      \\n There is quite an array of evidence\\n      that neurasthenia which has entered upon a hypochondriacal stage or\\n      complication with or without a strong hysterical admixture, is curable by\\n      sudden impressions in the form of a shock, or more gradually by frequent\\n      repetitions of an impression. Such cases, as I have shown above, occur\\n      most commonly in the stage when what may be considered the essential\\n      pathological disturbances of function have run their course and have left\\n      the patient in a state of mental disturbance which indicated that the\\n      patient\\'s recovery depends entirely upon her volition. But there is none,\\n      and so far nothing has succeeded in arousing it. Persuasion is as useless\\n      and irritating, as argument would be in a case of insanity with a fixed\\n      illusion. The resemblance between this and the state of mind of a\\n      hypochondriacal neurasthenic is very close. She cannot move nor thick.\\n      Exhaustion overcomes her and keeps her its victim for years, when suddenly\\n      the scene changes, and a few days or weeks suffice to restore the patient\\n      to activity. In one instance it is attributed to medical, in another to\\n      \"mind cure,\" in a third to \"Christian science;\" in\\n      still other cases massage has done it, in others again \"magnetic\\n      influence,\" in others the very powerful factor necessity. It is\\n      certain that cases of this kind, produced by sudden effects on the mind of\\n      a predisposed person, are also cured by such effects. Whatever the visible\\n      form of these effects may be -whether that of \"Christian\\n      science,\" joy, grief or absolute inexorable necessity, there is\\n      always to be noticed a certain force and condition involving the modern\\n      idea of suggestion, which comes to the patient in an irresistible degree\\n      and now sets the function of the will in motion again.\\n      \\n Experience teaches that it is by no\\n      means a matter of indifference which of these forms of effect are brought\\n      into action. In one case it is the professional Christian scientist\\'s\\n      method, in another the almost brutal exertion of a person\\'s will combined\\n      with some physical force. In either case the patient is aroused from his\\n      inertia, and discovers his powers of mental and bodily ability to act.\\n      \\n A deplorable result is that recoveries\\n      after such effects are attributed in the popular mind to supernatural\\n      causes. That such is not the case may be gathered form instances occurring\\n      in very sensible and intelligent patients, whose reason is scarcely ever\\n      so far disturbed and weakened that they do not resent the proposition of\\n      trying, e.g., Christian science or mind cure.\\n      \\n Nevertheless, it is the mind cure which\\n      the intelligent patient needs quite as much as the ignorant and\\n      superstitious person; the difference is only the form in which the\\n      influencing force is applied. While in one case it is obedience to the\\n      candidly expressed instructions of the physician, in the other case the\\n      result is the to mystification. In either case it is the powerful stimulus\\n      of hope and aroused confidence that recovery will be realized.\\n      \\n The definition of suggestion does not\\n      fully cover the meaning, because the influence employed is greater than\\n      mere suggestion. The physician\\'s plan of action should be straightforward\\n      assurance of recovery, a direct appeal to hope, and an unceasing endeavor\\n      to arouse the self-reliance of the patient, not so much by verbal\\n      exhortations as by a manner and department from which the patient learns\\n      more readily than from words what is expected. If the attitude of the\\n      physician is appreciated, and seconded by the relatives and attendants, a\\n      favorable result is much more certain to follow.\\n      \\n Hypnotism is not advisable. There are\\n      now existing ancient neurasthenic invalids dating from the times of\\n      spiritualism when they were famous \"mediums.\" Hypnotism weakness\\n      the will and nervous endurance, and produces a predisposition to emotional\\n      nervousness with an intractable erotic admixture. The suggestions sought\\n      to be instilled into a hypnotized patient amount to nothing. The mental\\n      influence of mystical treatment administered while the patients is awake\\n      is much more powerful in awaking hope and confidence than the uncertain\\n      effects of an abnormal state like that of hypnotism. Mystification, again,\\n      though sometimes unavoidable with the best intention, is less powerful\\n      than direct and intelligible encouragement. While resort to mystification\\n      should be shunned by reputable physicians, the question arises as to what\\n      shall be done with the many who, from lack of intelligence or education,\\n      are entirely beyond the reach of honest common sense, and who will persist\\n      in mystifying themselves, who remain neurasthenic invalids in spite of the\\n      best regulations of the physician, and who do not recover unless their\\n      encouragement follows some mystical formalities which alone arouse their\\n      \"faith\" and finally their confidence and will-power. For the\\n      present there is no way out of the dilemma but to submit such patients to\\n      the suggestive methods of what is popularly known as mind cure and\\n      Christian science. In doing so, physicians should use their influence as\\n      far as possible in selecting the most honest persons of this class.\\n      \\n DISCUSSION.\\n      \\n JAMES C. WOOD, M.D.: I have nothing but\\n      words of praise for Dr. Wesselhoeft\\'s excellent paper. It is very evident\\n      that the author\\'s inspiration came not from books but from actual contact\\n      with neurasthenic subjects, for the impress of originality is most\\n      conspicuous. It is a production which could only come from one of\\n      experience and from a reasoner. I consider it a most valuable contribution\\n      to the literature of that now most interesting subject,\\n      \"neurasthenia\".\\n      \\n The doctor, in his paper, has sometimes\\n      used the term \"neurasthenia\" instead of\\n      \"neurasthenia.\" The first of these means, according to Thomas,\\n      great nervous power or excitement; the second, nervous debility. I taken\\n      it from the context that the subject dealt with is neurasthenia. To the\\n      average mind there exists what seems to me a needless confusion regarding\\n      the terms, nervous prostration, hysteria and hystero-neurosis. As I\\n      understand these terms they define distinct conditions, though there is a\\n      frequent blending the one with the other. The term nervous prostration,\\n      which is a synonym of neurasthenia, defines itself; the term hysteria\\n      should be restricted to those general neuroses characterized particularly\\n      by psychical manifestations, though not infrequently by motor, sensory,\\n      secretory, vasomotor and reflex derangements as well; while the term\\n      hysteroneurosis implies the uterine origin of symptoms manifesting\\n      themselves in organs remote from the uterus without structural changes in\\n      such organs, being the direct result of reflex nervous influence starting\\n      from the uterus. The last term does not occur in the paper under\\n      discussion. From the standpoint of a gynecologist I think that this is\\n      misleading.\\n      \\n Let us see why and how it is that these\\n      three conditions (I will not call them diseases) are so frequently\\n      associated. I think that all will admit the frequent occurrence in woman\\n      of reflex symptoms, the result of pelvic lesions. An irritation staring\\n      form the pelvis is conveyed to the genito-spinal centre, thence to any or\\n      all organs with which this centre communicates. The organ oftener involved\\n      than any other is the stomach. This is shown by the frequent occurrence of\\n      nausea and vomiting following conception. The nervous system may have been\\n      previously involved, but oftener it becomes so only after the nutrition is\\n      depraved, which, sooner or later, occurs if the pelvic lesion is not\\n      removed. The depraved blood fails to supply the nerve centres with that\\n      which they need to sustain them, and they become anaemic. Prostration is\\n      but a subjective manifestation of the anaemia, and it varies in degree\\n      from a slight indisposition to the most abject helplessness.\\n      \\n If, then, nervous prostration may have\\n      its beginning in a pelvic lesion, is it possible for a pelvic lesion to be\\n      inaugurated by systemic disturbances? Personally, I believe that it is,\\n      and offer this explanation as the modus operandi by which such a lesion is\\n      induced: Marked circulatory changes nearly always attend nervous\\n      prostration. The circulation is presided over by the vaso-motor system,\\n      and wear and repair depend upon the proper regulation of this system. If\\n      it becomes disturbed, the bloodvessels dilate or contract unduly, with\\n      resulting local hyperaemia or local anaemia, as the case maybe. The\\n      climacteric flushes are the result of such disturbance. The alternate\\n      coldness and heat of the extremities, so often associated with rectal and\\n      uterine lesions, is another familiar illustration. If the brain is\\n      involved, either insomnia or drowsiness occur, depending upon whether the\\n      brain is anaemic or hyperaemic. Flatulence, gastralgia, and nervous\\n      dyspepsia result when the stomach is similarly affected. The womb and the\\n      ovaries, because of the periodical congestion imposed upon them, are\\n      oftener implicated by these unnatural circulatory disturbances than any of\\n      the pelvic organs, and in time also become unduly hyperaemic or anaemic,\\n      as the case may be.\\n      \\n It will thus be seen that nervous\\n      prostration may exist independently of pelvic lesions, or, conversely,\\n      pelvic lesions may exist independently of nervous prostration.\\n      Nevertheless, the two are frequently associated, and this fact ought, I\\n      believe, to be kept in mind in dealing with the affection known as\\n      neurasthenia. Hysterical manifestations nearly always come to the surface\\n      in nervous prostration, and they also frequently attend pelvic lesions.\\n      Indeed, the term \"hystero-psychosis\" has been coined for the\\n      purpose of defining certain psychical disturbances of presumably pelvic\\n      origin, and in the broadest sense neurasthenia is not uncommonly an\\n      hysteroneurosis. It is the frequent association of these three conditions\\n      which, it seems to me, makes it more practicable to study them conjointly.\\n      \\n The special symptoms of nervous\\n      prostration are most variable. Introspection, as Dr. Wesselhoeft has\\n      pointed out, makes of the patient a nosomaniac. The anaemic nerve centres\\n      are unduly impressionable, and a mental shock which would not seriously\\n      affect a stronger and more rugged woman falls with crushing force upon one\\n      whose nutrition is already depraved. In this way are developed disorders\\n      of sensibility, alternations of mobility, circulatory disturbances,\\n      anomalies of secretion and exertion, disorders of the gastro-intestinal\\n      canal, dermatoses, and general and psychical disturbances of all kinds.\\n      Many of these affections start from pelvic lesions, and are nearly always\\n      associated with depravity of nutrition and more or less nervous\\n      prostration.\\n      \\n Some of the worst symptoms of\\n      neurasthenia with which I have had to contend have been hyperaesthesia of\\n      the articulations, giving rise to the so-called \"hysterical\\n      joint.\" Here the prostration is usually not profound, and it is\\n      possible to apply the somewhat energetic treatment recommended by Dr.\\n      Wesselhoeft. I remember one case very distinctly, the detailed history of\\n      which I shall give in another place, which brought me much reputation\\n      because of the \"remarkable\" cure I was fortunate enough to make.\\n      \\n The patient, a beautiful girl of\\n      eighteen, had been bed- ridden for three years with supposed hip-joint\\n      disease. She was in college before assuming the ride of an invalid, and\\n      worried much over her studies and work. She sustained a fall a short time\\n      previously to taking to her bed, and to this fall the injury to the hip\\n      was attributed. She had been from physician to physician and from\\n      sanitarium to sanitarium without receiving benefit. All of the numerous\\n      medical men under whose care she had been, directed their attention to the\\n      hip and applied the classical treatment for morbus coxarius without avail.\\n      The patient had finally reached a point where introspection was her chief\\n      occupation and her mind dwelt almost continually upon a \"diseased\\n      hip.\" She was finally brought to me, coming in an invalid\\'s chair and\\n      looking the very picture of dependency. There was a slight degree of\\n      anaemia, though this was not marked. Notwithstanding the expression\\n      expression of abjectness the girl did not look seriously ill. The hip was\\n      excessively tender upon pressure, but there was no local increase of\\n      temperature, no evidences of fever and suppuration, and forcible\\n      apposition by striking the heel was not very painful. More less spastic\\n      contraction of the flexor muscles of the affected side existed, which gave\\n      to the limb an appearance of actual shortening, which was very deceptive.\\n      Hysterical symptoms were common. On examination I found the left ovary\\n      exquisitely tender. Compression of the ovary increased the pain in the hip\\n      most decidedly and gave rise to much nervous agitation. I did not,\\n      therefore, deem it wise to recommend local treatment other than the daily\\n      use of the hot douche. She had long been a victim of ovarian\\n      dysmenorrhoea. I placed upon the ankle of the affected limb three pounds\\n      of bar-lead, prescribed a pair of crutches and insisted upon her walking.\\n      The lead was used to overcome the spastic contraction as well as for its\\n      moral effect. I did not deem the joint lesion of such a character as to\\n      used extension. In two months\\' time this patient discarded her crutches\\n      for a cane. Six weeks later she put up the cane and is now perfectly well.\\n      \\n This was a case in which somewhat harsh\\n      measures were eminently appropriate.\\n      \\n In marked contrast to the case just\\n      recorded is the following: Mrs.-, aet. 47, widow for twenty years. She is\\n      a devoted church-woman, and for years was a leader in all charitable work\\n      done in the community in which she resided. Through friends she was urged\\n      to consult me, and I think that the call to the neighboring town in which\\n      she lived was countermanded at least four or five times before the finally\\n      mustered up courage and strength enough to see me. Upon reaching the\\n      bedside I found my patient in a room made dark by closed blinds, over\\n      which were hung heavy blankets to shut out every ray of light. The mirror\\n      was turned toward the wall for fear a ray of light might strike it and\\n      flesh throughout the darkened room. Nor did the patient rest under these\\n      extreme precautions, for the eyes were protected with two pairs of colored\\n      glasses with side attachments. Hyperaesthesia of the sense of hearing was\\n      equally marked and the noise was excluded from the room by double doors\\n      whose keyholes were stuffed with cotton. She l so had her ears filled with\\n      cotton, over which she wore ear-mufflers. She was emaciated to an extreme\\n      degree, and had been reduced to her miserable condition by a series of\\n      events which frequently precede profound neurasthenia. Her husband was\\n      killed during the war, and she was left childless. Twelve months previous\\n      to taking to her bed she nursed her mother through a long and fatal\\n      illness. This greatly prostrated her, yet she kept up until a favorite\\n      brother-in-law was thrown from a carriage and killed. This was the last\\n      straw, and the shock compelled her to take to her bed. In due time loss of\\n      appetite with irritability of the stomach developed, which, of course, led\\n      to marked depravity of nutrition. With the anaemia came hyperaesthesia of\\n      the special senses, spinal irritation, headache, hysterical\\n      manifestations, etc. There was no series pelvic lesion, although she had\\n      been much treated for an alleged uterine displacement with congestion.\\n      Unfortunately, she was encouraged, instead of discouraged, in her\\n      invalidism, and she soon became a nosomaniac of the worst type. She had\\n      written down her symptoms one at a time, and the record is such a typical\\n      one that I should like to give it in full, but time forbids.\\n      \\n With great difficulty the patient was\\n      moved on a cough to a private hospital and placed under the Weir Mitchell\\n      treatment. I ignored the pelvic trouble entirely. It is unnecessary to\\n      give in detail the progress of the case from day to day after this\\n      treatment was inaugurated. Suffice it to say that the improvement was of\\n      the most marked character, and in six weeks from the time she entered the\\n      hospital she walked to her carriage with her eyes and ears unprotected.\\n      She soon resumed her church and charitable work, in which she again takes\\n      much delight.\\n      \\n This woman wanted to get well. She was\\n      a woman of pure motives and high ideals. She had, in the language of Dr.\\n      Wesselhoeft, the wish, but, unaided, not the will. She required the aid of\\n      an intelligent, strong-minded, nurse who could bring to her exercise\\n      applied in such a way as to enable her to assimilate food without the\\n      expenditure of nerve force. She co- operated with her physician and nurse\\n      in every possible way, and as soon as the anaemic nerve cells became\\n      flushed with new blood she began to improve. To have commanded this\\n      patient \"to take up her bed and walk\" before improving her\\n      nutrition would have been as unscientific as to have placed the first\\n      patient in bed with extension and counter-extension applied to the limb. I\\n      know of no class of cases requiring for their successful treatment more\\n      tact and discrimination than that under consideration.\\n      \\n I feel confident that I have many times\\n      cut the affection short in its prodromal stage by removing the girl from\\n      college work and insisting upon open-air exercise. Static electricity has,\\n      in my hands, proved exceedingly useful both during the prodromal stage and\\n      that of convalescence.\\n      \\n I will conclude by saying that I have\\n      been impressed with the frequency with which an hereditary history of\\n      epilepsy has been met with in the cases of neurasthenia passing under my\\n      observation.'\n",
      " 'Tresorie - SOME OF THE DISEASES PREVENTING AND COMPLICATION PREGNANCY\\n[Diseases Preventing & Complicating Pregnancy]\\n\\n STERILITY.-DeSinety, Treub, Furbinger,\\n      et al., attribute 50 per cent. of unproductive marriages to the husbands,\\n      saying that sterility in the male is more often the cause of barren\\n      marriages than is generally supposed.\\n      \\n This cause of sterility I pass by, as\\n      also sterility due to mechanical obstruction, incomplete ovulation and the\\n      numerous other causes of this condition, too manifold for mere\\n      enumeration, to consider obesity as a causative agent in this condition. I\\n      need not say that the advocates for surgical interference for the relief\\n      of this condition are legion. Sims makes the assertion that sterility can\\n      be cured by surgical means only. That, of course, is Allopathic arguing\\n      pure and simple. Cases requiring surgical interference do arise, but any\\n      treatment which raises the nutrition of the entire organism, improves the\\n      blood-formation, and favors the resorption of pathological products in the\\n      sexual organs, is to be regarded as the indicated remedy.\\n      \\n Published statements are my authority\\n      for saying that excellent results have followed the administration of\\n      drugs, nevertheless; and in complete defiance of all therapeutic measures,\\n      a certain percentage of women remain barren; for with the more occult\\n      causes of sterility we remain, as yet, unacquainted, consequently they\\n      cannot all be reached with say kind of treatment whatever.\\n      \\n The following case I report somewhat in\\n      detail. Whilst not an exceptional case at all, it bears directly upon the\\n      subject under consideration, and possesses, it seems to me, some decidedly\\n      interesting features. My object in selecting this particular one is to\\n      call attention, if possible, to a condition not sufficiently considered.\\n      Mrs. J., aet. 26, married about two years and a half, appealed to my\\n      knowledge for a reason as to why she remained childless. The lady was\\n      carrying an excess of flesh, being under the medium height, and weighing\\n      186 pounds, but appeared to be in good health; family and previous history\\n      all that could be desired. Examination showed none of the common causes of\\n      sterility; neither, so far as I could ascertain, was the husband\\n      responsible for this unproductive condition of affairs. Some previous\\n      experiences of my own, with the added testimony of other and able men, was\\n      my reason for charging this condition of things to the excess of flesh,\\n      this, by the husband, being laughingly charged to excess of laziness.\\n      \\n We all, undoubtedly, are familiar with\\n      that peculiar disease of the blood-corpuscles which, whilst producing\\n      flesh, relaxes at the same time the muscular force; acting also, I\\n      believe, upon the muscular fibres of the uterus and upon the ovaries,\\n      inducing not only serious menstrual disorders but sterility. McKee,\\n      Philbert, and others give several instances of sterility chargeable to\\n      obesity, the women in question having been married several years without\\n      bearing children, and all became mothers after losing a portion of their\\n      flesh. If any other argument were needed in support of this theory we\\n      might turn to the quadrupeds, where we find the poorest breeders among the\\n      fleshiest animals. Fournel has a very able treatise on \"The Effects\\n      of Obesity on the Menstrual Functions and Parturition.\" Without\\n      having had any actual case of this description to deal with, he inclines\\n      very strongly towards the belief that obesity favors sterility. In the\\n      treatment of the case before mentioned, the patient was subjected to a\\n      daily massage of the entire body, with a special pelvic massage three\\n      times a week. This, in the main, consists in elevating the uterus as high\\n      as possible with the finger in the vagina, ending with a quick and decided\\n      vibratory motion. The diet received particular attention, as at this time\\n      there was a slight gastric ailment. The indicated remedy, Thuja, was given\\n      in the minimum dose. At the end of three months almost thirty pounds of\\n      flesh was gone, a considerable reduction. As an experiment, I recommended\\n      coitus in the knee-elbow position, advising that the lady remain quiet as\\n      long as possible after coition, with thighs well flexed. She became\\n      enciente, but miscarried at eight weeks. There was, comparatively\\n      speaking, but little pain and not much subsequent haemorrhage. She made a\\n      rapid recovery. Since then a living child has been born to them.\\n      \\n I believe I am safe in saying that this\\n      result would hardly have obtained were it not for the prophylactic\\n      measures adopted.\\n      \\n At the end of the first two months the\\n      patient was attacked with haemorrhage. A similar occurrence took place at\\n      irregular intervals during the following five months, the quantity of\\n      blood lost being much greater than that at the normal menstrual period.\\n      \\n For the greater part of the last five\\n      months she kept her bed, at the end of which time the tendency of the\\n      uterus to empty itself could be resisted no longer. A seven months\\' child\\n      was born, and is to-day doing well.\\n      \\n Pseudocyesis cerebral pregnancy,\\n      phantom pregnancy (whatever name we may call it by) is a disease which\\n      must come under the head of those \"complicating pregnancy.\" Mrs.\\n      M., a lady, married two or three years, aet. 29. Previous history good,\\n      always enjoying perfect health. When I first saw the lady in question she\\n      was a perfect picture of health, and, according to appearance and her own\\n      statements, about seven months pregnant. I made no examination. This\\n      appeared to be a thoroughly intelligent woman, and, according to her own\\n      statement, there was cessation of the menses. There certainly was an\\n      enlargement of the abdomen and breasts, a milky secretion, and the lady\\n      was sure that she felt foetal movement. On February 28th of the present\\n      year I was called to attend her in labor. Examination showed that no\\n      pregnancy existed. So far as I could ascertain there was no assignable\\n      origin for this condition other than nervous influences, the phenomena\\n      being purely muscular distension of the abdomen.\\n      \\n Mayham reports a case of a woman 73\\n      years old, claiming to be pregnant; he also claims that subsequently she\\n      was delivered of a child; this is an Allopathic report, however, of which\\n      we will take a Homoeopathic dose. Haultain reports three cases of cerebral\\n      pregnancy. In the first, he says no cause whatever was to be found; in the\\n      second, there was a small fibroid growth in the anterior uterine wall.\\n      Hauck reports a case where the vomiting, peristalsis, and flatus, caused\\n      by alcoholism were supposed to be caused by the pregnant state. Such cases\\n      are uncommon, but they emphasize the importance of making a thorough\\n      examination, in all cases where positive information is desired of the\\n      existence or non-existence of pregnancy.\\n      \\n Hyperemesis Gravidarum.-An animated\\n      discussion, held recently between two celebrated Allopaths of Stuttgart\\n      and Leipsic, has served to awaken a renewed interest in this subject,\\n      without in the least adding anything new to our stock of knowledge\\n      regarding its aetiology. Notwithstanding the frequency of the vomiting of\\n      pregnancy, its very distressing character in many instances, and its\\n      imminent, its very distressing character in many instances, and its\\n      imminent danger, we find but very few contributions of any value, to\\n      either the aetiology of the disorder or its therapeutics. I do not expect\\n      to add anything specially new myself, but it does seem to me that our\\n      knowledge of the vomiting of pregnancy, is to say the least, in a most\\n      contradictory state. Some physicians look upon it as a trifling matter,\\n      others as a thing to be endured, and some-these are in the right too-view\\n      even the mildest cases with gravity. Even in the mildest cases of morning\\n      sickness there is a constant drain upon the nervous system, putting the\\n      sufferer into a condition, in which she is very much less able to endure\\n      parturition than she would otherwise have been.\\n      \\n Dr. Harrison Mettler says: \"After\\n      careful inquiry I find that women who suffer from much morning sickness\\n      have as a rule, tedious or otherwise troublesome labors. I have observed\\n      in multiparae that at one time they will have much nausea and vomiting\\n      followed by a difficult labor, while at another time they will be quite\\n      free from the vomiting, and will pass through the succeeding labor with\\n      comparative ease.\" I must say my observations make me agree with Dr.\\n      Mettler entirely; when one thinks how rapidly the mildest of cases assume\\n      pernicious forms, indifference is certainly no longer to be excused. There\\n      is a voluminous literature upon this subject, and many and varied are the\\n      aetiological reasons given for this very variable affection, a large\\n      majority of writers coinciding in the opinion that \"many causes\\n      operate together,\" to produce what we are pleased to designate the\\n      \"vomiting of pregnancy.\" I believe myself that in a large\\n      percentage of cases, this pernicious vomiting is simply the result of a\\n      reflex neurosis. Undoubtedly uterine displacements frequently cause\\n      vomiting; but when this is so, and the displaced organ is raised by\\n      packing the vagina with aseptic wool, the vomiting ceases.\\n      \\n Lillie reports a number of cases, where\\n      obstinate vomiting was caused by a retroflexed uterus, and restoration of\\n      the organ caused a cessation of the disorder. Bezugloff having a\\n      persistent case of morning sickness, introduced a bougie it no the uterus,\\n      the intention being to produce abortion; the immediate result was a\\n      stoppage of the vomiting, and the pregnancy went on to full term.\\n      \\n In the case just cited, I must say that\\n      I believe it was the fright, caused by the thought of abortion being\\n      performed, more than the effects of introducing the bougie, which operated\\n      so successfully; I say now, as I said before, I believe that the\\n      pre-eminent cause of this kind of sickness must be looked for i the\\n      nervous system. Flint speaks of this form of sickness as being decidedly\\n      neurotic in its origin, and cites a number of cases of a chronic variety\\n      of dyspepsia frequently occurring in young girls. I had one such case come\\n      under my personal care. There was a persistent morning sickness, with this\\n      young lady, and a disagreeable nausea whenever food was taken; this\\n      patient was at some distance from her home, in a boarding school, and she\\n      will probably never know that the lady principal entertained very grave\\n      thoughts at one time in regard to her virtue. It certainly was very\\n      difficult to differentiate between this and the vomiting of pregnancy; it\\n      was, however, simply due to a vitiated nervous system. My theory is\\n      supported by Alt, who records a number of such cases; I cite one only, the\\n      case being that of a highly hysterical woman, six months pregnant,\\n      suffering from the gravest vomiting, and anxious that miscarriage be\\n      induced. She was making preparation for entering the hospital for this\\n      purpose, when one of her children was seized with pneumonia. The anxiety\\n      felt over the child, forced all thought of self from the mother\\'s mind;\\n      from that moment the vomiting ceased and she remained well until the\\n      termination of pregnancy.-Minchener Medicinische Wochenschrift.\\n      \\n Whilst saying that I believe this\\n      disease to be in the majority of cases of purely nervous origin, I would\\n      not imply thereby that it is not to be feared, far from it; if neglected,\\n      we know how likely it is to pass quickly beyond treatment and our patient\\n      succumb from sheer exhaustion.\\n      \\n In the treatment cited such as\\n      insertion of bougies, dilation of the os, pelvic massage, etc., I believe\\n      it is merely the \"doing something,\" no matter much what it is,\\n      so long as you have gained the confidence of your patient, that does good.\\n      We have seen how suddenly Hyperemesis will cease if the patient be\\n      alarmed; it may be, has often been, and will to again, cured by a process\\n      skin to suggestion. Kattenback had a case where the patient, a primipara,\\n      was seized with an incorrigible vomiting. It was suggested to her that her\\n      stomach contained some lumps of unwholesome material and their removal\\n      would cure her. Some milk was given her, and the stomach ceremoniously\\n      washed out. its contents bore no indications of either over-acidity or\\n      abnormal ferment She was informed that she was all right and the vomiting\\n      would not return; neither did if, and she was safely delivered at term.\\n      \\n There is a familiar and now well-know\\n      phenomena, by which these neurotics can be influenced; I speak of\\n      hypnotism; it is due to purely subjective conditions.\\n      \\n There is an identity of the hypnotic\\n      susceptibility with the condition of hysteria, and it is along these lines\\n      that we can work. Just as many times as I have tried this method of\\n      treatment, for these cases of excessive vomiting, just so many times has\\n      it given me gratifying results.\\n      \\n The patient can be to sleep by\\n      bi-ocular pressure, and the idea of cure suggested; the operation may have\\n      to be repeated several times, at intervals of a day or so, but you will be\\n      rewarded by the cessation of the vomiting, often with but one suggestion.\\n      Where the patient is not easily controlled by means of the bi-ocular\\n      pressure, Luy\\'s revolving mirror is a never failing resource.'\n",

It must recognize too, that\\n      the sick individual has to take an active part in his treatment and not be\\n      merely the passive recipient of this or that treatment. For just as it is\\n      rightly said that man does not live by alone, so should it be emphasized\\n      that man cannot be cured by medicine alone. He must see to it himself that\\n      he lives as far as possible a physically and psychically healthy life.\\n      Indeed, each individual has a power within himself to help in his own\\n      cure.\\n      \\n Do the official schools of medicine\\n      teach such an art today? I am afraid not: they are so intent on seeking\\n      the specific treatment for this or that named disease or the antibiotic\\n      that will most effectively put out of action the organism regarded as the\\n      cause of the disease, that they are losing sight of the individual\\n      himself.\\n      \\n But Homoeopathy in its persistent\\n      search for the reactions of the individual to his environment in the\\n      broadest sense, no matter of what the patient is complaining surely\\n      fulfills these requirements, especially when it is recognized that the\\n      homoeopathic potencies do not anything to the patient as do the drugs of\\n      the dominant school, but rather stimulate the patients own recuperative\\n      powers to overcome the infection or re - establish the normal metabolism\\n      which has become deranged by the illness.\\n      \\n When you consider how the homoeopathic\\n      physician diagnoses the individuality of his patient over and above the\\n      name of the disease from which he is suffering, and uses for the purpose\\n      of his prescription rather than the name of the disease this personal\\n      diagnosis of the patients mental and emotional reactions, his responses to\\n      changes in weather conditions, the alternations in his environment which\\n      influence his symptoms, etc., one realize how very individualistic is the\\n      Homoeopathic prescription fitted to that particular patient.\\n      \\n The homoeopathic physician does not\\n      seek for a remedy specific to any named disease and which he can thus\\n      apply almost automatically once he has made his organic diagnosis, which\\n      in quite an appreciable number of instances may ultimately be found to be\\n      wrong and so the treatment based upon it must therefore have been wrong.\\n      He does not, as is so often done, merely suppress the most outstanding\\n      symptom by an appropriate drug; for example giving an anodyne to mask the\\n      pain or removing the skin eruption by some strong local application, in\\n      other words putting the dust under the mat and pretending the room is\\n      clean.\\n      \\n Strangely enough the homoeopathic\\n      physician is often accused by his allopathic critic in his ignorance of\\n      Homoeopathy, of merely treating symptoms, whereas it is the critic himself\\n      who practices this superficial medicine. The homoeopathic physician, on\\n      the other hand, treats his patient as a whole through his symptoms and\\n      their modifications through changes in the environment, which is quite a\\n      different matter.\\n      \\n Homoeopathic therapy, unlike methods of\\n      treatment, is based on a natural law \"Similia Similibus\\n      Curentur\" \"Likes may be cured by likes\" which has been\\n      proved time and time again by experiment and which anyone with the will to\\n      do may prove for himself. It is not subject to constant change brought\\n      about by this or that latest discovery, and which itself will soon have to\\n      give way to the still later idea.\\n      \\n Having now introduced to you our actor,\\n      what of the scene in which he is to play his role?\\n      \\n This is the nineteen hundred and fifty\\n      - fourth year of the Christian era and the second year of the reign of our\\n      much loved and admired young Queen Elizabeth II, who will remember while\\n      in south Africa on her twenty - first birthday, before she had any idea\\n      that she would so soon be called to such an exalted position as she holds\\n      today, broadcast to the commonwealth and Empire her resolve to dedicate\\n      her life to the service of this grand community which dedication she\\n      recently repeated at her Coronation.\\n      \\n Here in Great Britain we have a more or\\n      less complete welfare state, with which idea some of us may very strongly\\n      disagree, whilst others believe such a development is the result of a\\n      natural very desirable social evolution.\\n      \\n As one necessary ingredient of this\\n      welfare state came, in 1948, the initiation of the National Health\\n      Service, through which the great majority of the population receives its\\n      medical attention, although it is rightly available to all.\\n      \\n When we come to consider the role that\\n      homoeo - therapeutics should play in this scheme, I would suggest that we\\n      should regard the problem from the purely medical aspect, forgetting any\\n      political party allegiances or sympathies we may have; or if we cannot\\n      forget them we should remember that the organization of the National\\n      Insurance Scheme of which the National Health Service is but a part, was\\n      first blue printed by the well - known Liberal supporter, Lord Beveridge,\\n      and the Health Service plans developed by the Coalition Government of all\\n      three major political parties.\\n      \\n We are living at present in an age\\n      which may very justifiably be regarded as a violent age in which have been\\n      developed so many appalling instruments of destruction, the use of some of\\n      which we are quite complacently accepting and from the use of others we\\n      are refraining, not because we consider them immoral, but simply through\\n      the fear of the wholesale destruction which would be caused by their use.\\n      We are seeing X-rays used in very high voltages in the treatment of\\n      cancer, we are being constantly remained of the use of dangerous drugs in\\n      medicine, without justification, in my opinion, bearing in mind the\\n      doubtful and evanescent ameliorations they produce and the violent\\n      surgical treatment of mental patients.\\n      \\n One further violence we should not\\n      forget is the way some of our foods are devitalized by the extraction of\\n      this or that portion of the natural product for purposes quite foreign to\\n      the well - being of the people who are to feed on them; or they are\\n      contaminated by the addition of this or that dangerous chemical, either\\n      during the growing of the plant, in the form of sprays, or as so called\\n      improvers in, for instance, the manufacture of white bread. It is very\\n      significant in this regard that quite a lot of attention is paid to the\\n      protection of the man who sprays the crops, but the right of the consumer\\n      to have uncontaminated food is slurred over by the unjustifiable statement\\n      that the amount of these chemicals so consumed is so small that it cannot\\n      have any bad effect on the consumer. We who practice Homoeopathy know how\\n      unwarranted is such a statement.\\n      \\n Can we homoeopathic physicians and\\n      patient hope to be able to do anything to make the still small voice of\\n      Homoeopathy heard in all this tumult, so that we may return to a saner and\\n      more healthful way of life and help our young Queen in her lifes work for\\n      the communitys sake?\\n      \\n Can we expect any help from the leaders\\n      of the medical profession? I am afraid not, because although I believe it\\n      accurate to state that there is a very slowly growing interest in, and\\n      tolerance of our work by individual doctors, the medical authorities are\\n      still, in their prejudice, strongly opposed to us. The London University\\n      still refuses to recognize our Hospital as a post - graduate teaching\\n      Hospital: the British Medical Association prohibits the formation of a\\n      homoeopathic section of its organization, and the Royal College of\\n      Physicians still refuses its membership to any one known as a homoeopathic\\n      physician. Yet in spite of this unfavourable environment, I firmly believe\\n      that there is a future for our method of therapeutics: but it will have to\\n      be pursued with courage, determination, foresight and energy. Surely if we\\n      believe as I do, that we are the guardians of a system of treatment\\n      destined to make our people healthier and therefore more efficient and\\n      happier, we would be failing in our duty to our country if we did not take\\n      every means in our power to acquaint the community at large with the\\n      advantages of this system and the dangers of ignoring it. This is a duty,\\n      not only of the profession, but also of the laity interested in\\n      Homoeopathy and who have experienced its benefits.\\n      \\n Every physician has two professional\\n      obligation to the community, that of preserving its health and that of\\n      endeavouring to restore it to being when it has fallen by the way.\\n      \\n The homoeopathic physician, thorough\\n      his knowledge acquired through the provings of drugs, even in\\n      infinitesimal doses, has, I believe, a very special responsibility as\\n      regards the prophylaxis of disease. It seems to me that a great deal of\\n      chronic ill health may quite conceivably be due to the manipulations of\\n      our foods and to the artificial manuring of the ground in which many of\\n      them are grown. Experiments have been carried our proving that plants\\n      grown in soil enriched by natural manuring, are much less prone to\\n      diseases than those grown with the help of artificial chemical manures. It\\n      seems a fairly justified conclusion that vegetables grown under these\\n      artificial conditions may quite well be deficient in something necessary\\n      for our perfect health. It is therefore incumbent upon the physician to\\n      advocate whenever possible the ingestion of healthily grown foods in the\\n      widest sense of that term.\\n      \\n The same duty applies when we consider\\n      the great amount of drugging in which the community at large indulges by\\n      its excessive smoking, particularly when aggravated by the practice of\\n      inhaling, and by the continued and prolonged use of drugs for this or that\\n      symptom, too often, unfortunately, though not always, on the prescription\\n      of their medical advisors.\\n      \\n There is a great lack throughout the\\n      community of any real enthusiasm for perfect health: we are only too prone\\n      to be content to follow like sheep, the unintelligent and harmful\\n      practices of the majority of our fellows.\\n      \\n Similarly in the curative realm, we\\n      homoeopathic physicians have special obligations.\\n      \\n When considering our position vis-a-vis\\n      the rest of the profession, we must never lose sight of the fact that our\\n      approach to the sick individual is a much broader and more comprehensive\\n      one than that of the dominant school. This latter prides itself on its\\n      scientific approach to its problems. One must, however, always be on ones\\n      guard against being hypnotized by that word scientific. The scientific\\n      aspect of any phenomenon or problem dealing with humanity is only one\\n      limited aspect of that problem. To get a complete picture one must\\n      consider other aspect, such as the aesthetic, emotional, maybe religious,\\n      and above all, perhaps one might say embracing all, the philosophical\\n      approach. This complex approach to his patients problem is the one that\\n      the homoeopathic physician always strives to adopt, and so never loses\\n      sight of the ego of the patient, while at the same time not forgetting his\\n      physical make - up.\\n      \\n Because this approach of ours to our\\n      patients is a much broader and more comprehensive one than the much\\n      vaunted scientific aspect, which the dominant school has come to regard as\\n      the Ultima Thule of medicine, I deplore the oft - repeated request of some\\n      of my colleagues that we should forsake our philosophy and make our work\\n      as scientific as theirs. I do not mean to imply by this that we should\\n      neglect the scientific angle of our patients illness but we should always\\n      remember that is only one facet of our problem. That is why we take such\\n      pains to diagnose our patients personality with his reaction to his\\n      environment in addition to the physical diagnosis of the case in order to\\n      arrive at our prescription for his malady. In other words, we should\\n      endeavour to lead our dominant school colleagues to our way of thinking,\\n      rather than that we should adopt theirs.\\n      \\n At the same time must always remember\\n      that if our philosophy should seem at any time to contradict so - called\\n      scientific laws, we must re - examine our philosophy, and if necessary\\n      modify it, while at the same time remembering that many times in the past\\n      what have been regarded as laws have ultimately been proved not to be so.\\n      Thus it is evident that we must never relax our self - examination.\\n      \\n What shall be the role of the\\n      homoeopathic laity?\\n      \\n The first thing for them to remember is\\n      that we are living in a democratic country whose government is dependent\\n      on the goodwill of the governed, and that, if a sufficient number of\\n      voters desire a certain line of action, that line will be adopted by the\\n      government.\\n      \\n The second thought is that there are\\n      not nearly sufficient doctors practising Homoeopathy in Great Britain to\\n      satisfy the present demand, let alone any further increased demand in the\\n      future, for this line of treatment.\\n      \\n Does not this seem strange, having\\n      regard to the great advantage to humanity that Homoeopathy provides? Not\\n      if one looks below the surface and so finds the reason for this shortage.\\n      \\n Surely the most potent reason is that\\n      Homoeopathy is not taught in the official Medical Schools, either as a pre\\n      - or post - graduate study. The London University when asked to recognize\\n      the Royal London Homoeopathic Hospital as a post - graduate Medical\\n      School, refused on the plea that as Homoeopathy was not taught in the\\n      undergraduate Medical Schools, it could not find a place for it in its\\n      post - graduate curriculum.\\n      \\n It is, of course, nonsense to suggest\\n      that a graduate should pursue his studies only in those subject of which\\n      he had already obtained some knowledge in his undergraduate days and\\n      should not wish to obtain information on any new or extra subject.\\n      \\n The University Medical Shools are\\n      enabled to a great extent through Government grants. We must therefore\\n      find some way of influencing whatever Government be in power to bring\\n      pressure to bear upon the London University to remove this obstacle to the\\n      better health of the community at large. I am quite satisfied that once\\n      this academic recognition is obtained we shave many more post - graduate\\n      students of Homoeopathy.\\n      \\n I believe than in a democratic\\n      community, having a universal State Medical Service, it is the bounden\\n      duty of the Government to remove all obstacles to the peoples obtaining\\n      that form of medical treatment in which they have confidence. So long as\\n      Homoeopathy is denied its legitimate status, so long must be Government be\\n      deemed to b failing in its duty to the country.\\n      \\n If, however, we are to achieve this\\n      desirable object of full recognition, we must all, professional and laity,\\n      be fired with enthusiasm, not only for the abstract cause of Homoeopathy,\\n      but for being partners with our young Queen in delicating our lives to the\\n      community.\\n      \\n When we do this we shall help to make\\n      this second Elizabethan era one to be remembered throughout the ages to\\n      come as surpassing the first Elizabethan era in that it gained not so much\\n      the economic and political leadership of the world - though that is not to\\n      be despised - but showed the way to the most healthful and spiritual way\\n      of life that all the world look notice and followed suit.\\n      \\n To sum up, the Role of Homoeopathy, as\\n      I see it, is to humanize the practice of medicine. By that I mean it must\\n      bring the practice of medicine into line with a reasoned philosophy of\\n      life, restore to it its artistry and rid it of all unnecessary hazards. It\\n      is to do this, not from any abstract academic sense of superiority, but in\\n      order the years to come are not those of merely another reign, but to\\n      ensure a veritable Renaissance, starting with the second Elizabethan era\\n      in which Great Britain will take its rightful place in the comity of\\n      nations as the pathfinder to a way of life for which posterity will be\\n      able to say \"Thank God for Queen Elizabeth the Second and her\\n      peoples.'\n",
      " 'Tresorie - Roentgenometric Pelvimetry [Roentgenometric Pelvimetry]\\n CHARLES W.PERKINS, M.D.\\n      \\n Norwalk, Conn\\n      \\n FOR some time the x-ray has been used\\n      to advantage in diagnosis of multiple pregnancy, position of fetus and\\n      fetal abnormalities. However, it has been only the past four or five years\\n      that any definite information has been obtained by roentgenographic\\n      methods of diagnoses in pelvimetry.\\n      \\n At the present time we are convinced\\n      that only by means of roentgenographs can be true proportions of the\\n      superior strait be determined, and that the ordinary external methods of\\n      Pelvimetry are not only occasionally misleading but proportionately\\n      inaccurate.\\n      \\n The present communication deals with\\n      the method of Herbert Thomas of Yale University. This method was developed\\n      in cooperation with the late Dr. W.A. Lafield, who was Professor of\\n      Roentgenology at the Yale Medical School.\\n      \\n Some of the reasons why roentgen\\n      pelvimetry has not been more universally adopted are probably due to the\\n      following factors.\\n      \\n (1) The majority of women will be\\n      delivered normally, whether or not pelvic measurements are made.\\n      \\n (2) The medical profession does not\\n      readily accept a new method after an established satisfactory routine has\\n      been in use.\\n      \\n (3) A new method of diagnosis incurs\\n      added expense.\\n      \\n (4) The present methods, although\\n      entirely speculative, are satisfactory in most cases.\\n      \\n (5) Roentgen pelvimetry cannot be\\n      performed by the obstetrician himself but requires the aid of a\\n      roentgenologist.\\n      \\n (6) The value of roentgenometric\\n      diagnosis is recent in origin and as yet not universally accepted.\\n      \\n If the knowledge of the size and shape\\n      of the pelvis is necessary to the practice of obstetrics, roentgen\\n      pelvimetry is a sound procedure, particularly in pre-emptors patients, and\\n      should and should be considered as an indispensable aid in these cases.\\n      \\n The method of Herbert Thoms as\\n      developed at Yale Medical School is not the only method. However, it can\\n      be classified as simple, accurate and rapid; being adaptable for use by\\n      other than experts in x-ray and obstetric diagnosis. As a technical\\n      procedure a well trained hospital technician can master its technic alter\\n      sufficient instruction.\\n      \\n Studies of recent years reveal the fact\\n      that external Pelvimetry fails to give uniform and accurate information in\\n      regard to the shape and size of the superior strait. This is often true of\\n      thin undersized individuals. In many patients of this type external\\n      measurements may suggest a contracted pelvis while the x-ray will show a\\n      relatively large pelvis with a subsequent natural labor and normal-sized\\n      child. On the other hand a stocky short person with similar external\\n      measurements will disclose a contracted pelvis which is an obstetric\\n      problem. Because of the apparent relationship between shortening of the\\n      transverse diameter and a secondary persistent occipito-posterior\\n      presentation, accurate information regarding this diameter is of clinical\\n      significance.\\n      \\n The observations of Thomas were made on\\n      twenty consecutive patients whose pelvis showed a relative or real\\n      shortening of the transverse diameter of the superior strait. In every\\n      instance a primary or secondary occipito posterior position was found\\n      after the patient was in labor. (Herbert Thoms, Surgery, Gynecology and\\n      Obstetrics, January, 1933). It therefore has been proved that an actual or\\n      relative shortening of a transverse diameter of the superior strait\\n      results in a limitation of space that is greater in the anterior than in\\n      the posterior half of the superior strait. Under these circumstances, when\\n      the head descends early in labor, the occiput is forced to rotate\\n      posteriorly.\\n      \\n The x-ray offers additional information\\n      in determining the size of the fetal head. It has been noted in x-ray\\n      examination of the unengaged fetal head that it lay with the transverse\\n      diameter of the superior strait, the occiput being either to the right or\\n      left; therefore, if roentgenogram of the patient is taken in the supine\\n      position with the fetus in the uterus, it will cast a shadow which is an\\n      enlarged profile of the head. The measurements of the occipital frontal\\n      diameter of the head can then be made. On numerous occasions this method\\n      of cephalometry, determining the diameter of the unmoulded head before and\\n      after cesarean section, has yielded accurate results. (Thomas, A.M.A.,\\n      February 24, 1934).\\n      \\n As experience increases in roentgen\\n      pelvimetry, the so-called labor test will be employed less. This, however,\\n      does not mean that the physician should not under estimate the importance\\n      of uterine contraction and the ability of the fetal head to mold. It has\\n      always followed that when something could be proved desirable in medicine\\n      for the better protection of the patient, such an advance would be\\n      demanded and eventually become routine. We may concede, therefore, that\\n      roentgen pelvimetry has a distinct place in the examination of every\\n      primiparous woman. In many instances, according to Thomas and others,\\n      external; measurements were normal but the x-ray examination revealed a\\n      contracted pelvis. On the other had, in certain patients whose external\\n      measurements suggested a cesarean section roentgen pelvimetry proved\\n      otherwise and they were subsequently delivered in a normal manner.\\n      \\n CENTIMETER GRID METHOD.\\n      \\n The procedure in this method may be\\n      summarized by stating the following:.\\n      \\n (1) The patient is placed on the\\n      roentgenographic table in the semi- recumbent position.\\n      \\n (2) The level of the superior strait\\n      above the sensitized film is established.\\n      \\n (3) The tube target is centered about\\n      five centimeters posterior to the symphysis, at thirty-two inches from the\\n      sensitized film, The exposure is made.\\n      \\n (4) The patient is removed from the\\n      table, the tube target and sensitized film remaining in situ.\\n      \\n (5) A lead plate, or centimeter grid,\\n      with perforations exactly one centimeter apart, is introduced into the\\n      same plane as that previously occupied by the superior strait and a second\\n      (flash) exposure is made on the same sensitized film as was used used in\\n      the previous exposure.\\n      \\n (6) Development of the film shows the\\n      outline of the superior strait and the shadows of the perforations, the\\n      assistance between which represents centimeters in the plane of the\\n      superior strait. The anteroposterior and transverse diameters of the\\n      superior strait in its use proportions may be drawn on centimeter-square\\n      paper by following the course of the shadow of the superior strait and\\n      transcribing it.\\n      \\n As this time I wish to express my\\n      thanks to Dr. Thoms for his personal advice and instruction which helped\\n      me to master the technic of his method.'\n",
      " 'Tresorie - NOTATU DIGNUM [Test Of A Homoeopath]\\n\\n Complaints are not unfrequently made\\n      that the homoeopathic materia medica is too vast for practical utility;\\n      that the schematised list of symptoms are unprofitable, if not impossible\\n      reading.

Indeed, I think that the test of a genuine\\n      homoeopath might not unfairly be said to life in his capacity to read\\n      through a Schema with both profit and enjoyment because of the\\n      possibilities it reveals of dealing with cases occurring every day in\\n      practice.

      " 'Tresorie - THE EFFICACY OF THE VIBROMETER IN APPLYING VIBRATORY MASSAGE\\nIN AURAL DISEASES [Efficacy Of Vibrometer In Applying Vibratory Message In Aural\\nDisease]\\n\\n SINCE presenting my paper before the\\n      American Institute, in June of last year on \"Vibratory Motion as a\\n      Method of Massage in Aural Diseases,\" I have been using an instrument\\n      specially devised for that purpose called the \"vibrometer.\" This\\n      instrument is in shape like a banjo, and has four strings stretched across\\n      its length resting on a bridge, which sets upon a diaphragm. On each side,\\n      elevated above the diaphragm and supported by posts, are two horizontal\\n      bars, which support the mechanical appliances used for producing the\\n      various vibratory motions. This consists in what is called a yoke, in\\n      which revolves a shaft connected with the electro-motor by pulley-wheels\\n      and a belt. Behind the diaphragm is a shallow air-tight compartment,\\n      leading from which are rubber tubes that are inserted in the external\\n      auditory canal during treatment, consequently any vibratory motion of the\\n      diaphragm, which must necessarily be an inward and a corresponding outward\\n      movement, would be exactly reproduced upon the membrana tympani, as the\\n      confined air, not being able to escape, will undergo an alternate\\n      condensation and rarefication in the external auditory canal.\\n      \\n Every vibratory movement of the strings\\n      of the instrument is communicated to the diaphragm by means of the bridge\\n      upon which it rests. These strings by varying their tension and length can\\n      be regulated to give a high or low rate of vibration as desired, for\\n      instance, the heaviest string left at its original length adjusted to a\\n      slight tension may make about fifty vibratory motions to the second, while\\n      the highest string on the instrument adjusted to a high tension and\\n      clamped down to one-fourth its original length would probably make three\\n      thousand vibratory motions to the second.\\n      \\n In the centre of the diaphragm is an\\n      attachment which works on a lever, and when hit by the cam on the\\n      revolving shaft lifts the diaphragm to a considerable extent, causing a\\n      powerful effect on the membrana tympani. This attachment can be adjusted\\n      at four different leverages, which causes a modification or increase of\\n      its intensity and can be regulated at from one to twenty-five vibratory\\n      movements to the second. This is only used in very bad cases and for not\\n      more than five minutes continuously.\\n      \\n The instrument which I have been\\n      describing in an improvement on the first manufactured, and as far as I\\n      know, is the only one which offers the same facilities for applying this\\n      method of massage. The class of patients in my experience who are\\n      generally benefited from the first, are those in which the mucous membrane\\n      lining the tympanic cavity and Eustachian tubes is in a hypertrophic\\n      condition. The membrana tympani are depressed, opaque, and thickened. They\\n      usually complain of a stiffed sensation in the ears, with a great deal of\\n      tinnitus aurium, and that their hearing is worse during a cold. In cases\\n      where the mucous membranes are atrophied with a large external auditory\\n      canal perfectly dry and Eustachian tubes patulous, and generally very\\n      little tinnitus, this or no other treatment has done very much good in the\\n      majority of cases, and in looking ever my records I find that only about\\n      five per cent. have been relieved, while in the before-mentioned cases the\\n      good results reach at least seventy-five per cent. In treating persons, I\\n      always select the rate of vibration which corresponds in pitch, if\\n      possible, to that caused by the diseased condition of the ears. If there\\n      is no tinnitus to guide me, I find whether the patient can hear a high or\\n      low sound better; if it is a low sound, a high rate of vibration is used\\n      in treatment, and vice versa, A point which I would like to explain here\\n      is this: It is not necessary that the sound from the instrument should be\\n      of the same quality of the tinnitus experienced by the patient, but merely\\n      the same pitch. for instance, if a banjo, where one of the strings was\\n      adjusted when sounded to produce a certain note, and a musical instrument\\n      of any other kind, whose quality of tone was entirely different, was made\\n      to sound the same note in a room, the string on the banjo would vibrate in\\n      sympathy, which has been proven by experiment, any other note, no matter\\n      how loud, would have no effect. Another point is in the way the strings of\\n      the vibrometer are set in motion. On the revolving shaft is a wheel\\n      projecting from which are metallic picks which hit the string it is\\n      adjusted over. It does not make any difference in the number of vibratory\\n      motions per second, whether the string is hit fast or slow, but at the\\n      time the string is first hit the intensity is greater than it is just\\n      before being hit again, and as the motion of the wheel is perfectly\\n      rhythmic, revolving so many times to the second, it has just as good an\\n      effect as if the intensity during the fraction of a second did not vary at\\n      all. The idea of using vibratory motion, as I have said before, originated\\n      within my mind some years ago, and later put into practical operation, and\\n      as far as I know, was the first to lay before the profession in a\\n      scientific manner, this method of massage.\\n      \\n I have found that when two of the\\n      strings upon the vibrometer were regulated in such a way that when both\\n      were set in vibration at the same time, producing the sensation of a\\n      harmonious sound, the effect in some cases on the tinnitus was especially\\n      beneficial, relieving, where the various kinds of vibrations produced by a\\n      single string failed. Sub-acute cases of deafness, accompanied by tinnitus\\n      aurium, are quickly relieved, as the following case will illustrate:.\\n      \\n Mrs. M. Young, married lady, aet. 26,\\n      called at my office, April 1, 1893, complaining of partial deafness and\\n      tinnitus aurium. She had a stuffed sensation, or as if cotton had been\\n      packed in the external auditory canal. She says the tinnitus was so\\n      annoying as to prevent sleep. On examination, found considerable\\n      retraction of the membrana tympani, and hearing for the watch, on the\\n      right side five inches, on the left, seven inches. The Eustachian tube\\n      were partially closed, which made inflation somewhat difficult, giving\\n      slight relief. I used several of the vibrations on the different strings\\n      without immediate benefit.\\n      \\n April 4th.-She came again, and reported\\n      that no improvement had taken place. I again inflated her ears, after\\n      which she sat down to the vibrometer. The central attachment was used with\\n      considerable force continuously for four minutes, after which she declared\\n      that the tinnitus had entirely ceased in the right ear, and greatly\\n      modified in the left; the hearing for the watch had increased for both\\n      ears to fourteen inches, and the stuffed sensation had almost entirely\\n      disappeared. On inspection of the membrana tympani, found them\\n      comparatively very slightly retracted. On April 8th, found improvement had\\n      continued, when the same treatment was used for three minutes; after which\\n      she declared herself completely relieved of the tinnitus and stuffed\\n      sensation, with hearing powerfully restored. Saw her again on April 13th,\\n      when she declared the good results from last treatment to have still\\n      continued.\\n      \\n I find that in the majority of cases,\\n      when the strings of the instrument are used it is only necessary to strike\\n      them lightly with the friction wheel. In vibrating the heavy string, I\\n      generally set the bridge back behind the central attachment, and adjusting\\n      the motor in such way that the belt is at a considerable tension, so that\\n      the pulley-wheel revolves slowly. I also generally use this adjustment\\n      when setting in motion two strings at one time. The principle of this\\n      method of treatment embraces two essential features which to my mind makes\\n      this system of massage the only scientific one applicable to the membrana\\n      tympani and its associate sound-conducting parts. Message is the\\n      application of motion to disease, and its scientific administration\\n      consists of its application in a systematic manner. In applying massage in\\n      aural diseases, it is necessary to produce a to-and-fro movement of the\\n      membrana tympani, and, if possible, by a force which is harmless and at\\n      the same time effective. The vibrometer fulfils these conditions. Any of\\n      the strings on the instrument that may be set in motion by the\\n      friction-wheel, will produce a certain number of vibratory movements to\\n      the second of time, and the movements of the central attachment are also\\n      measured. What could be more systematic than this? The motions of the\\n      membrana tympani were intended by nature to its vibratory, and as the\\n      vibrometer generates measured motion, and these motions are vibratory,\\n      theoretically we have a scientific and effective method of massage in\\n      aural diseases; and, as demonstrated practically by the use of the\\n      vibrometer, we have in fact a great scientific advance over all previous\\n      methods. Since the introduction of this treatment in aural diseases, it\\n      makes possible a more or less benefit in cases of deafness heretofore\\n      considered hopeless, and has opened up the field for the treatment of\\n      aural diseases to such an extent that the number of deaf patients seeking\\n      relief at the aurist\\'s hands will at least double itself.\\n      \\n DISCUSSION.\\n      \\n H.C. HOUGHTON, M.D.: Dr. Garey\\'s\\n      admirable paper gives us the description of the vibrometer, an instrument\\n      devised under his personal direction and inspection, for the purpose of\\n      applying massage to the ear. It is the only instrument of the kind on the\\n      market, so far as I am aware, and after a somewhat prolonged use of it, I\\n      am prepared to recommend the latest production of the vibrometer company.\\n      \\n This instrument is a decided\\n      improvement over the instrument first sent out, and is capable of\\n      producing a most profound effect upon the drum-head and ossicula; indeed,\\n      upon the entire auditory apparatus. I am able to confirm Dr. Garey\\'s\\n      statement of the effect of high and low vibrations us regards treatment.\\n      \\n I have also been very much interested\\n      in the use of stringed or reed instruments for diagnosis, and find that we\\n      can detect any abnormal sensitiveness of the auditory nerve to high or low\\n      tones. Some patients are extremely sensitive to all tones, high or low;\\n      others to high tones and not to low tones; others, conversely. Again, in\\n      some instances, there is a peculiar sensitiveness to single tones or to\\n      discords produced by sounding the note and half-note at the same time.\\n      Under the action of the central attachment of the vibrometer this\\n      sensitiveness is modified, the sensitiveness to high tones disappearing\\n      and being replaced by a low tone or, conversely, under treatment, a low\\n      tone disappears and a high tone is established, temporarily, at least.\\n      Again, in cases of recent origin, treatment will substitute an undefined\\n      rushing sound for a definite musical tone, either high or low, and later,\\n      the treatment will abolish this, the patient being relieved of this\\n      intensely annoying symptom. In some cases, with this relief, there is an\\n      improvement in the audition; in other cases, no improvement follows.\\n      \\n I confess to the domination of the\\n      material over my mind in my earlier experience with massage, and I think\\n      the inclination of operators will be to use a far greater degree of power\\n      than is necessary. I therefore notice with great satisfaction Professor\\n      Garey\\'s remark that \"the object should be to produce a to-and-fro\\n      motion to the membrana tympani, and, if possible, by a force which is\\n      harmless and at the same time effective.\" I would hardly say\\n      \"to-and-fro motion of the drum-head,\" because I think that the\\n      expression is liable to perpetuate the motion which is fixed in the minds\\n      of most physiologists, that the drum-head moves as a whole, with a\\n      to-and-fro motion.\" That is true under the influence of the Politzer,\\n      Siegle\\'s otoscope and similar instruments; but it certainly does not so\\n      move in the ordinary function of audition, but stands as the iris does in\\n      the eye, as an adjustor, a regulator of sound-force; in some sense as the\\n      iris does in its relation with the lens, to adjust, regulate and direct\\n      the essential force, and the vibration of the drum-head is at every node;\\n      every portion receives impressions that are converted into molecular\\n      disturbances of varying lengths, according as they are produced upon the\\n      stiff and unyielding portions of the drum-head at the periphery, along the\\n      manubrium, or in the more attenuated and easily-yielding portions which\\n      the between these two areas. Not only so, but these impulses are\\n      communicated to the contained air of the tympanum, and make their\\n      impression upon the acoustic nerve through the round window synchronously\\n      with the impression made through the ossicula.\\n      \\n This whole subject widens before my\\n      mind in such a way that one might wish himself twenty years and at liberty\\n      to devote himself to a term of research in acoustics, such as is offered\\n      only in the technical schools of the continent of Europe.\\n      \\n WM. R. KING, M.D.: In discussing Dr.\\n      Garey\\'s paper I shall begin by saying that his methods have been closely\\n      followed by me since the beginning of his experiments, owing to the fact\\n      that I have been greatly interested in the treatment of deafness and\\n      tinnitus by means of sound waves or by aural massage since 1887, and have\\n      experimented and treated many cases by this method since then, though with\\n      crude and unsatisfactory instruments. Since using the vibrometer-which,\\n      after much study and experimentation, is now presented to the profession\\n      in practical shape-I have undoubtedly increased my percentage of good\\n      results.\\n      \\n I don\\'t believe I am over-sanguine or\\n      carried away by interest in this method, and believe I can rightly\\n      appreciate that this does not offer us a panacea or cure-all for auditory\\n      ailments, and hope I may always be ready to see the failures and to strive\\n      to find methods or remedies to reach some of them.\\n      \\n In speaking of the application of the\\n      instrument, I wish to call attention to the central attachment or post foe\\n      vibrations. Dr. Garey has not given it as much attention in the paper as\\n      it deserves. It is very useful as a general means of aural massage,\\n      rougher in nature and more general in application than the strings which\\n      help to make up the instrument. I often use it before applying the\\n      \"similar found\" to a given case, as a species of gymnastics, to\\n      stimulate secretion and motion in the conducting apparatus of the ear,\\n      viz., membrana tympani and ossicles. In most cases-in fact, in all-where\\n      tinnitus is present, I follow this up immediately by the nearest approach\\n      to the similar pitch obtainable.\\n      \\n I agree thoroughly with Dr. Garey, that\\n      the best results are achieved in cases accompanying hypertrophic catarrh,\\n      and that the least benefit is apparent in cases of atrophic nature.\\n      \\n Regarding the method of treatment in\\n      the absence of tinnitus, my experience the does not coincide with that of\\n      the author of the paper entirely; I do not feel that as yet we have any\\n      safe rule to guide us. My method has been to try the numerous sounds and\\n      variations the of until I find the one that seems to give the best\\n      immediate results, or that the patient himself will speak of as very\\n      penetrating and powerful )though not necessarily loud and heavy).\\n      \\n It seems almost impossible at present\\n      to simulate all the qualities of tone as they occur in the ears of those\\n      suffering with tinnitus; in fact, it would appear to be unnecessary.\\n      However, it seems advantageous and quite necessary to secure the closest\\n      simulation of pitch, thus in many cases soon obliterating annoying\\n      tinnitus and improving hearing powers.\\n      \\n The arrangement permitting of the\\n      picking of two strings simultaneously adds decidedly the usefulness of the\\n      instrument, as it increases the range of pitch as well as varying the\\n      quality of tones procurable, thereby decidedly enlarging our field of\\n      application.\\n      \\n The force used for creating the message\\n      or gymnastics of the membrana tympani and the ossicles-viz, vibratory\\n      force or sound- carefully and scientifically applied, is nature\\'s remedy,\\n      because it is adapted by nature, and is the only force which can rightly\\n      or safely be applied to these delicate portions of this complex organ of\\n      hearing.\\n      \\n A startling commentary on this subject\\n      is the array of cases benefited who have been relegated to the shelf by\\n      ancient and modern otology; cases declared unhelpable have been vastly\\n      improved. Pray, make no mistake; I did not say all cases.\\n      \\n It may be interesting to hear the\\n      latest regarding the instrument which was first invented for the\\n      application of this method of aural massage Mr. E.J. Godman, the inventor\\n      and patentee, is constantly on the lookout, and always striving for\\n      improvements to his machine. He has made many that you all know of. Permit\\n      me to report a few so recent they have not yet left the factory.\\n      \\n First.-The machine has been taken from\\n      its case, and is now mounted on a solid stand or table of oak, being set\\n      below the level, or so that the face of the instrument is just level with\\n      the face of the table. This is all supported by rigid, solid metal legs,\\n      which absolutely prevent foreign vibrations.\\n      \\n Second.-The motor has been removed from\\n      its little shelf and relegated below the table. I t can be placed upon a\\n      box on the floor, a shelf against the wall, or, better yet, a shelf\\n      solidly attached to the metal supports of the table. A belt goes up\\n      through an aperture to a wheel on a shaft, the other extremity of which\\n      carries a wheel with a rubber tire (a friction wheel), which in its\\n      revolution, being in contact with a larger flat- surfaced wheel on the\\n      main shaft of the instrument, turns this in harmony with itself. This\\n      arrangement does away with the necessity of shifting the motor each time\\n      you wish to shift the carriage from one string to another- a consummation\\n      to be devoutly thankful for. The removal of the motor from the instrument\\n      as at present attached will recommend itself to all who have used the\\n      vibrometer, a great amount of undesirable jar being thus avoided.\\n      \\n Third.-Ratchet keys capable of very\\n      fine adjustment of tension of strings are now provided for the instrument.\\n      \\n Fourth.-A rheostadt or resistance-coil\\n      is now to be placed beneath the table between the storage battery and the\\n      switch, by this means enabling us to control the speed and number of\\n      revolutions to a nicety.\\n      \\n Other, though comparatively minor,\\n      improvements are being made, and others are contemplated, as, for\\n      instance, the substitution of a roughly corrugated rubber band for the\\n      picker on the wheel, thereby getting rid of the metallic sound of the\\n      picker on the wire strings.\\n      \\n I have experimented with a number of\\n      appliance for the production of the sounds and pitches that I have\\n      required, but I always fall back on the vibrometer, especially as at\\n      present constructed, for satisfactory work and results.\\n      \\n This instrument may be, and probably\\n      is, as yet, in its infancy. It, and the method it applies, can only be\\n      perfected by constant work and experimentation both on the part of the\\n      profession and of the manufacturers. Each improvement we can suggest, if\\n      it only should serve as a means of helping one solitary case, would be\\n      well worth our while.\\n      \\n The experiments being made by different\\n      methods for treating deafness by sound waves is indicative of the interest\\n      the profession has taken in the matter. It is indicative of a lack of\\n      something in our usual armamentarium which is greatly longed for by\\n      patient and doctor; that is, the means for making the deaf hear and for\\n      relieving distressing tinnitus. There has been a dearth in this direction,\\n      and perhaps there still is, but I believe fully that we have in aural\\n      massage by vibratory force a decided acquisition at our hands.\\n      \\n E. H. LINNELL., M.D.: I would simply\\n      like to ask Dr. King how long he uses the instrument, and whether he uses\\n      it according to the deafness.\\n      \\n DR. KING: Yes, decidedly. In an intense\\n      case of deafness I would have to use it a great deal longer. The central\\n      attachment I never carry over three or five minutes, and the whole\\n      treatment I don\\'t think is over carried over twenty or twenty-five minutes\\n      in one case, and usually averages from ten to fifteen.\\n      \\n HAROLD WILSON, M.D.: I have only to\\n      suggest, what I have elsewhere called attention to, the possibility of\\n      another mechanical device for securing vibratory motion. It is well known\\n      that in the make and break of a current of electricity, in the circuit of\\n      which there is a telephone, we get an influence upon the make and break of\\n      the current in the telephone. Now, it is a simple matter with which these\\n      makes and breaks are made as to obtaining any number of vibration that you\\n      wish. You may, by a mechanical device of some rotary motion, if you\\n      choose, make and break the current as rapidly as you please until you have\\n      reached several thousand vibrations a second, or you may even make the\\n      vibrations so slow us to be easily counted. The application of this\\n      suggestion has been put in force in my own practice, more or less, in the\\n      use of the telephone as connected with the induction-coil ordinary\\n      battery. The more intense the current, the more intense the sound. You can\\n      easily see that it is mere question of mechanics to secure these two\\n      sounds-intensity of vibration and rapidity of vibration. I will say,\\n      furthermore, that it has this advantage. There is no noise in the office,\\n      which I think is not altogether true of the vibrometer. I would suggest\\n      that so far as the vibrometer is concerned, if it could be made to be\\n      noiseless to anybody but the patient, it would be a decided improvement.\\n      In that respect the telephone is a decided improvement, because there is\\n      no noise except to the patient, because the noise is right at the ear of\\n      the patient. If I were seeking for a perfected instrument in this line, I\\n      would go outside of the banjo idea. As we have the most perfect writing\\n      machines, which have no connection with the ordinary method of writing,\\n      and sewing machines, which have no connection with sewing by hand, so it\\n      occurs to me that possibly the securing of he vibratory motion upon the\\n      ears might be obtained in a totally different way from that which you get\\n      when you listen to the drum of the guitar or an ordinary musical\\n      instrument, and I would suggest that the make and break of a telephone\\n      open a very fruitful field for mechanical experimentation.\\n      \\n H.C. HOUGHTON, M.D.: In my study of\\n      this subject I made the acquaintance of Mr. Bernhardt, of New York City,\\n      who is a personal friend of Mr. Emil Berliner, the inventor of the Emil\\n      Berliner Telephone, which is the instrument by which the Bell Telephone\\n      Company maintain their monopoly at present. Mr. Berliner is the inventor\\n      of the graphophone, and has, I think, covered this whole matter which Dr.\\n      Wilson has mentioned. As ordinary Bell telephone receiver is put into the\\n      circuit of an ordinary induction machine, and you can use it just as the\\n      English people use the audiometer, and as you remove the coil you modify\\n      the vibrations, which is covered with another disk and a tube, and that\\n      tube covered with a stethoscope tube, which is the same as we use for the\\n      phonograph or vibrometer, and, as Dr. Wilson has suggested, you can modify\\n      the intensity, and of course the whole matter is adjusted by the\\n      attachment of the cord, so that you can have fine vibrations. The\\n      intensity of the vibrations is regulated by the distance to which you\\n      uncover the cord. The only difficulty in the adjustment is that it has\\n      been so severe that it is really uncomfortable, and the noise of the\\n      instrument is reduced to the minimum for office use.\\n      \\n A.B. NORTON, M.D.: I will also add that\\n      in regard to the objection Dr. Wilson makes to the noise, there is no\\n      doubt it is an annoying thing in the office, and in that line I have some\\n      men at work on my suggestion. We are devising another machine, or\\n      instrument, which is to be entirely enclosed in a cabinet, so there will\\n      be no noise whatever in the room if it is made a success. The idea is a\\n      little crude, and I am quite uncertain whether it will amount to anything\\n      or not. Then, in the line of what Dr. King was speaking in regard to Mr.\\n      Goodwin-he called, at New York, to see me last week. I made two little\\n      suggestion to him, which I think would be in line with his advancement.\\n      One is the number of the picks. The present vibrometer has four picks I\\n      suggest the experiment of trying twelve or sixteen picks, which will make\\n      a more continuous sound; it may be of some value. Then, in regard to\\n      regulating the speed of the machine: you regulate that now by a series of\\n      buttons, so as to get three different speeds. We will have a very slight,\\n      intermediate speed, and a very rapid speed. My experience with the\\n      vibrometer is especially favorable. I think the idea is in the right\\n      direction, and it is simply a matter of instrumentation.']\n",

Dietary sources of vitamin C include fruits and vegetables, particularly citrus fruits such as oranges.Severe deficiency of vitamin C causes scurvy. Although rare, scurvy results in severe symptoms and can cause death. People with scurvy are treated with vitamin C and should be under medical supervision.Many uses for vitamin C have been proposed, but evidence of benefit in scientific studies is lacking. In particular, research on asthma, cancer, and diabetes remains inconclusive, and a lack of benefit has been found for the prevention of cataracts or heart disease.The use of vitamin C in the prevention or treatment of colds remains controversial. Extensive research has been conducted. Overall, vitamin C lacked an effect on the development of colds and on cold symptoms. However, the duration of the cold shortened slightly. Notably, people living in extreme circumstances, including soldiers in the subarctic, skiers, and marathon runners, had a 50% decrease in the risk of developing a cold. This area merits additional research and may be of particular interest to athletes or people in the military.'\n",

Vitamin B12 is frequently used in combination with other B vitamins in a vitamin B complex formulation. Vitamin B12 is important in DNA synthesis. Vitamin B12 is bound to the protein in food. Acid in the stomach releases B12 from protein during digestion. Once released, B12 combines with a substance called intrinsic factor (IF) before it is absorbed into the bloodstream.The human body stores several years\\' worth of vitamin B12 in the liver, so low levels in the body are rare. Decreases in vitamin B12 levels are more common in the elderly, HIV-infected persons, and vegetarians.

Arginine is also found in many foods that have protein.Arginine becomes nitric oxide (a blood vessel-widening agent called a vasodilator) in the body. Early evidence suggests that arginine may help treat medical conditions that improve with increased vasodilation. These conditions include chest pain, atherosclerosis (clogged arteries), heart disease, heart failure, erectile dysfunction, peripheral vascular disease, and headaches from blood vessel swelling).Arginine also triggers the body to make protein and has been studied for healing wounds, bodybuilding, enhancing sperm production, and preventing tissue wasting in people with critical illnesses. However, caution is warranted. Arginine use was associated with death in some people with heart conditions. Caution is also needed when using arginine to treat pre-eclampsia (high blood pressure in pregnancy).Arginine hydrochloride has been used to treat metabolic alkalosis. This use should be under the supervision of a qualified healthcare professional.'\n",
      " 'Flaxseed and flaxseed oil (or linseed oil) are rich sources of the essential fatty acid alpha-linolenic acid (ALA). In the body, some ALA is converted to omega-3 fatty acids.Lignans are a type of plant hormone similar to estrogen. The lignan components of flaxseed (not flaxseed oil) may possess antioxidant properties and alter estrogen activity.As a source of fiber, flaxseed (not flaxseed oil) has laxative properties. In large doses, or when taken without enough water, flaxseed may cause bowel obstruction. The effects of flaxseed on blood sugar levels are unclear.Flaxseed oil contains only the ALA component of flaxseed and not the fiber or lignan components. Therefore, flaxseed oil may share the potential cholesterol-lowering properties of flaxseed, but not the proposed laxative or anticancer abilities.'\n",

      " 'Tresorie - The Present Status of Radiation in the Treatment of Malignant\\nConditions [Present Status Of Radiation in the Treatment Of Malignant\\nConditions]\\n ISIDORE ARONS, M.D.\\n      \\n New York, N.Y.\\n      \\n AT A meeting of the American Medical\\n      Association recently held in Cleveland, Dr. Joseph C.Bloodgood, in\\n      discussing a paper on radiation therapy, said that \"report at my\\n      clinic told me that 49 per cent of the patients previously operated on in\\n      the clinic now to for radiotherapy. This is based on results. They are not\\n      hopeless cases; they are still hopeful and they get well under\\n      radiotherapy. This has happened during the last three years, not because I\\n      have changed any but because the method of radiotherapy has changed. A\\n      great change has taken place. First of all, radium and x-rays are no\\n      longer looked on a last resort.\".\\n      \\n The foregoing bears witness to the\\n      progress made in the field radiation therapy. The manufacture of more\\n      adequate apparatus and the improved technic in its use reflect this\\n      improvement. Machines are used generally delivering twenty to thirty\\n      milliamperes of current at 200 K.V., while machines operating at 750 to\\n      1,000 200 K.V., using lower milliamperes, have been installed in several\\n      places in this country. Since the question of increased voltages began to\\n      dominate the field, machines operating at 400 to 600 K.V., using sealed\\n      tubes, have been manufactured in this country as well as on the been\\n      manufactured in this country as well as on the continent. This higher\\n      powered machines occupy little more space than the usual 200 K.V. machine.\\n      \\n The effectiveness of these stronger\\n      radiations is thought to be due to (1) the increased penetration and its\\n      consequently larger percentage depth doses, (2) the supposed higher\\n      selective action of short have length radiation on malignant cells, and\\n      (3) greatly increased x-ray output. Clinics using super-voltages report\\n      that clinical results are somewhat better than those secured through the\\n      use of the lesser voltage machine.\\n      \\n Experimental effort, from the physical\\n      and biologic point of view, has been exerted to establish to standard\\n      basis for radiotherapy since Roentgens discovery thirtyfive years ago, and\\n      its application five years later. Radiotherapists have only recently begun\\n      to understand the principles of clinical application or radiotherapy in\\n      the treatment of malignant conditions.\\n      \\n Regaud selected the rabbits testicle\\n      for his experiments because its histologic cellular structure was highly\\n      sensitive to radiation, containing cells which are in a state of active\\n      mitosis resembling that of malignant tissue. In 1922, Regaud reported that\\n      of malignant, tissue. In 1922, Regaud reported that it was impossible to\\n      sterilize the testicle by a single dose of radiation without causing\\n      serious damage to the overlying skin. The dose required to produced such\\n      radio necrosis was equivalent to about three radionecrosis was equivalent\\n      to about three erythemas when administered in one dose. However, by\\n      dividing the dose in such a manner as to prolong the treatment over a\\n      period of fourteen days, a total dose of about five erythemas could be\\n      given causing complete sterilizations without damage to the skin. Thus it\\n      is seen that by prolonging the time of treatment the cutaneous dose could\\n      be increased nearly 50 per cent without causing necrosis.\\n      \\n The above experiments were reported,\\n      and the same results determined, by Schinz and Slotopolsky in 1926, and\\n      again by Regaud and Ferroux in 1927. These experiments formed the\\n      foundation for the clinical studies of Pfahler (America), Hohlfelder\\n      (Germany) and Coutard (France), who have swung the pendulum from massive\\n      radiation, as advocated by the German school, to that of the protected\\n      fractional dose method. Results have been achieved by this method which\\n      are superior to previously reported; these are obtained by the improved\\n      method of administering a large dose to the (3 days) without causing\\n      destructive effects to the surroundings normal structure (or cancer bed);\\n      its effect are rather biologic than physical. The clinical application of\\n      the method of radiation by Pfahler, Countard, and Berven (Sweden) in the\\n      treatment of cancer of the tonsil, pharynx and larynx and have proved the\\n      radio-sensitive properties of squamous carcinoma, previously considered\\n      incapable of of responding to radiation.\\n      \\n According to Coutard, the neoplasm is\\n      exposed to x-rays twice daily, giving a total dose of 350 r to400 r to two\\n      areas, using 190 to 200 k.v., four milliamperes, two millimeters of copper\\n      and three millimeters of aluminum filtration at a distance of fifty of\\n      sixty centimeters, for lesion of the head and neck. For deeply situated\\n      lesions, such as cancer of the uterus, the focal distance varies from 80\\n      to 100 centimeters, the area of the field for the head and neck conditions\\n      being only 50 to 100 square centimeters, while those of the lower abdomen\\n      require on an average of 250 to 300 square centimeters. For the\\n      sterilization of the radio-sensitive squamous carcinomatous growth, a\\n      depth dose of 3,000 r to 4,000 r is given, while stronger dose is\\n      necessary for the radio-resistant tumors.\\n      \\n In the course of treatment of principle\\n      guides a radio reaction of the covering epithelium and the radio reaction\\n      of the cancer cells. The radio reaction of the cutaneous epithelium is\\n      called \"radio epidermitis.\"characterized by loss of epithelial\\n      layers and denudation of the dermis. The reaction of the mucous membrane ,\\n      called \"radio epithelitis,\" manifests itself by loss of the\\n      epithelial layer sand denudation of the mucous membrane, epithelial layers\\n      and denudation of the corium which becomes covered by a fibrinous and\\n      false membrane; of clear. The duration of both describe radio reactions is\\n      six weeks. Each appears at the beginning of three weeks and disappears at\\n      the beginning of the ninth week.\\n      \\n Should the total or daily dose or the\\n      intensity per minute be too high, or the filtration or the tension too\\n      low, the cancer bed would be modified. the nutrition of the malignant\\n      cells becomes impaired The cellular radio- sensitivity, which seems to be\\n      linked up not only with the mitosis of the cell but above all with the\\n      activity of their interchange with the cell but above all with the\\n      activity of their interchange with the surrounding normal structures,\\n      becomes diminished and at times suppressed. The cancer cells become\\n      incentive to radiation. This phenomenon is called \"radio-\\n      vaccination\" by Regaud.\\n      \\n Observation of clinical facts shows\\n      that changes in the surrounding normal tissue result from excessive daily\\n      doses and intensity per minute per minute causing radio resistance of the\\n      tissue. Conversely, radio- sensitivity would be prolonged with a smaller\\n      daily dosage and the resultant extended period.\\n      \\n Realizing that better results may be\\n      obtained by prolonged treatment, Coutard and his collaborators in the last\\n      few years have begun to extend the duration of treatment of certain\\n      so-called radio-resistant cancers from thirty to ninety days, giving weak\\n      daily doses in order of about 175, 220, 225 and 250 r per day, dividing\\n      the dose in two treatments. By this method he was able to cure a certain\\n      number of lesions on which he had not been able previously to obtain the\\n      same results, such as very differentiated epidermoid epithelioma invading\\n      the muscles and cartilages, glandular epithelioma of the breast ad the\\n      thyroid body, and special round celled epitheliomas of the upper part of\\n      the ethmoid and the adjacent sinuses. This mode of prolonged treatment not\\n      only controlled the condition locally but it lessened the frequency of\\n      metastasis.\\n      \\n When radiating a cancer of very\\n      embryonic, very radio-sensitive growths, the energy factor is predominant.\\n      The action of the x-rays seems to be direct and rapid; the treatment can\\n      be accomplished within fifteen to twenty days. The cells are destroyed and\\n      generally normal structures are affected very little. When radiating the\\n      less embryonic type of growths, the time of treatment should be longer.\\n      \\n Pursuing these general principles, I\\n      have adopted the Countard method with some slight modifications. The cures\\n      which I shall illustrate will show that the percentage of cures in a\\n      number of most dangerous epidermoid carcinomas has markedly increased and\\n      that some conditions formerly considered hopeless have been temporarily\\n      cured. In conclusion I wish to emphasize the following facts:.\\n      \\n (1) Cure of cancer by x-rays is still\\n      difficult and must not be entered into lightly and causally.\\n      \\n (2) Radiotherapy is just as radical in\\n      method as surgery, and requires great skill, judgment and experience.\\n      \\n (3) The cooperation of the pathologist\\n      and the radiotherapist is imperative for a proper estimate of the\\n      radio-sensitivity in relation to treatment of the lesion.\\n      \\n (4) Daily examination of the patient is\\n      necessary; modification of the normal structure and general reaction by\\n      the x-ray treatment sometimes appears to quickly that it is often\\n      necessary to diminish the daily dose or the size of the field in the\\n      course of treatment.\\n      \\n (5) There exists no fixed method of\\n      treatment, only a simple clinical treatment for each individual patient\\n      and for the special type of tumor..\\n      \\n (6) Improvement in roentgen apparatus\\n      of higher voltages, producing more penetrating rays, will permit a better\\n      relation between destruction of malignant cells and preservation of the\\n      supporting, and the radio sensitivity of the tumor may be prolonged.'\n",

This is the city where\\n      Homoeopathy was first introduced by Rajendra Lal Dutta of hallowed memory,\\n      who spent a princely fortune for dissemination of its principles and\\n      practice among his countrymen. This is the city where took place the\\n      dramatic conversion of one of the then medical luminaries of the first\\n      magnitude, to the practice of Homoeopathy under the influence of Rajendra\\n      Lal. I mean Dr. Mahendra Lal Sircar who became the high priest of\\n      Homoeopathy, spread its glory far and wide and gained thereby an\\n      international reputation for himself. This is the city where the\\n      celebrities of Homoeopathy like Dr. Berigny, Dr. Salzar, Dr. P.C.\\n      Majumdar, Dr. D. N. Roy. Dr. Younan, Dr. J.N. Majumdar, Dr. Baridbaran\\n      Mukherji, Dr. S.K. Nag, Dr. A.N. Mukherji, Dr. T.N. Palit, Dr. G.\\n      Dirghangi and a host of other talented physicians practised their\\n      profession with credit and success and held aloft the banner of\\n      Homoeopathy. This is the city where exist pioneer institutions for the\\n      teaching of Homoeopathy. This is the city wherefrom Homoeopathy has spread\\n      to all parts of India and its votaries are doing yeomans service for the\\n      good of the suffering humanity.\\n      \\n We are meeting this evening on a\\n      historic occasion and we have to arrive at decisions which might make or\\n      mar the future history of Homoeopathy in India. It may be that forces of\\n      disruption, destruction and obstruction are at work; it may be that self\\n      and vested interests seem to thwart the smooth progress of Homoeopathy; it\\n      may be that some may seem to play in the hands of the Powers that are not\\n      too sympathetic to the cause of Homoeopathy; it may be that the present\\n      seems to be chaotic and future of Homoeopathy dubious but great is truth\\n      indeed and will prevail. We should not lose heart or throw up the sponge.\\n      Tradition, authority, sectarianism, dogmatism are great obstacles on the\\n      way. But obstacles and difficulties are meant to be fought out and\\n      overcome. Strifes and dissensions, discords and disunities may hamper our\\n      progress but they are nonetheless signs of lifes activities. It is a good\\n      augury that the Homoeopathic profession is shaking off its age - long\\n      slumber and getting more and more conscious of its duties and obligation,\\n      its rights and privileges and of its short - comings and practical\\n      difficulties. The life of Hahnemann is there to encourage us; the\\n      masterful will of his dynamic spirit is there to inspire us to intensify\\n      our activities; his achievements are there to goad us to realise greater\\n      success; and his personality is always before us to take lessons from, in\\n      our life which as Swami Vivekananda puts it, is \"a process of\\n      unfolding and development of a being under circumstances tending to press\\n      it down.\"\\n      \\n That Homoeopathy is a scientific system\\n      of treatment, philosophically sound, logically unimpeachable, practically\\n      highly efficacious in curing the sick and cheap enough to suit the poor\\n      economic condition of the Indian masses - has become a much talked - of\\n      subject in the country. But why is it not spreading sufficiently and\\n      adequately in our motherland or in fact anywhere in the world? Why is our\\n      National Government not still keen on according official recognition to\\n      this superb system of healing art or providing ways and means for its\\n      development and diffusion? Why the public opinion is not gaining strength\\n      enough to put sufficient pressure on our Government to take interest in\\n      it? Why sufficient number of fully equipped Homoeopathic teaching\\n      institutions and hospitals are not growing to turn out adequate number of\\n      fully qualified Homoeopathic physicians in the country?\\n      \\n It is high time that we should draw the\\n      attention of the profession and the laity to provide answers to so many\\n      \"whys\" and to solve the pressing problems in the matter\\n      concerned. On a cursory view it becomes evident that the Homoeopathic\\n      profession, the people and the Government are each individually and\\n      collectively responsible for this impasse.\\n      \\n The so - called Allopathy still\\n      occupies the dominant place in any country, even in the land of birth of\\n      Homoeopathy. It is no wonder that Homoeopathy, being a discovery of merely\\n      a century and a half still lags behind its rival shool. But it is a wonder\\n      of wonders that Homoeopathy has already encompassed the whole world within\\n      such a short period since it was ushered into existence by Hahnemann.\\n      History of man reveals that nowhere a new truth was accepted by him easily\\n      and readily, obsessed as he is with conservatism, tradition, authority and\\n      vested interests. Nonetheless the triumphant march of Homoeopathy with a\\n      such a meteoric speed throughout the length and breadth of the world is a\\n      proof positive of the truth inherent in the system and phenomenal\\n      therapeutic efficacy of this healing art. It is one more glaring instance\\n      of mans love of truth against heavy odds that impede his progress at every\\n      step.\\n      \\n For the propagation of any new truth\\n      and its acceptance by man, in general, the first and foremost condition is\\n      the turning out of sufficient number of persons who have realised the\\n      truth and are adept in the practice of it. This involves establishment of\\n      a sufficient number of teaching institutions which will turn out experts\\n      in the science and art of Homoeopathy; and a sufficient number of\\n      Homoeopathic Hospital where, the efficacy of this system of treatment will\\n      be put to test.\\n      \\n Human knowledge is becoming\\n      unmanageably vast. The appearance of specialists has become indispensable.\\n      So special Hospitals for the treatment of specific types of diseases have\\n      sprung forth elsewhere, e.g. Tuberculosis Hospitals, Cancer Hospitals,\\n      Hospital for Tropical Diseases etc. Because of organisation of these\\n      hospitals people generally think of getting themselves treated in these\\n      institutions. As there are no fully - equipped general Homoeopathic\\n      Hospitals and not to speak of special Homoeopathic Hospitals and not to\\n      speak of special Homoeopathic Hospitals the result is Homoeopathy is not\\n      getting a fair chance of treating those diseases like tuberculosis,\\n      cancer, acute infectious diseases of epidemic type e.g., Small-pox,\\n      Cholera etc. on a large and organised scale. Consequently the general\\n      public cannot keep much faith in this treatment and mostly take recourse\\n      to homoeopathic treatment when the case is \"past all hope and past\\n      all surgery\". Hence the establishment of fully - equipped\\n      Homoeopathic institutions (College - cum - Hospitals) is an imperative\\n      necessity for enhancing the prestige of the Homoeopathic profession and\\n      for convincing the people about the therapeutic efficacy of this system of\\n      treatment. Is it not a pity that Homoeopathy once established its\\n      reputation by treating Cholera cases in this city and now nobody thinks of\\n      this treatment in Cholera cases and rushes the patient to the Allopathic\\n      Hospitals which are especially meant for these types of patients? How can\\n      we hope to gain ground under these circumstances?\\n      \\n The next great obstacle is the apathy\\n      and in many cases active antagonism of our Government, both at the Centre\\n      and at least in some of the State, towards Homoeopathy. The Government is\\n      under the thumb of its medical directorates which are solely manned by\\n      Allopathic doctors. The main reasons for the non - acceptance of the\\n      Homoeopathic system of treatment may be summed up in three words:\\n      tradition, authority and professionalism. Their psychology is easily\\n      understood if it is borne in mind that the conservative inertia of human\\n      mind attempts to reject any new thought will all the means at its\\n      disposal. Another reason is due to vested interests. Even a cursory glance\\n      at the history of origin and spread of Homoeopathy, enables one to find\\n      out that the opposition to this system from the start, was not scientific\\n      but rather of commercial nature on the part of the apothecaries who were\\n      afraid of losing their trade - profits. We regret to note that the Central\\n      Government have not yet implemented a single recommendation put forward by\\n      the Homoeopathic Enquiry Committee, Planning Commission. Third Health\\n      Ministers Conference, Ad Hoc Committee etc. though Homoeopathic Acts have\\n      been passed in the States of Bombay, U.P., Madhya Pradesh, Travancore -\\n      Cochin, Bihar etc. I is curious to note that W. Bengal is the only State\\n      where a Homoeopathic Bill has recently been thrown out by the State\\n      Government.\\n      \\n Another great obstacle is the\\n      psychology of the general mass of population who fail to adopt a proper\\n      philosophical attitude towards Homoeopathy and takes the Homoeopathic\\n      Therapeutic Law as great paradox contrary to common sense. Unless we can\\n      educate the public in the matter, we cannot hope to secure their whole -\\n      hearted support for this system of treatment.\\n      \\n Lack of enthusiasm for constructive\\n      works on the part of the Homoeopathic profession, the apathy of our\\n      Government and hesitancy on the part of the public to accept Homoeopathy\\n      are great obstacles to the spread of this system of treatment in the\\n      country. Unless this vicious circles is broken the progress of Homoeopathy\\n      is bound to be impeded. We have to fight on all fronts if we aspire to\\n      achieve victory in our battle for the cause of Homoeopathy and the\\n      suffering humanity.\\n      \\n But our first necessity as pointed out\\n      by the Soul of India expressing itself through Sri Aurobindo, is: If India\\n      is to survive and do her appointed work in the world, the youth of India\\n      should learn to think, to think on all subjects, to think independently,\\n      fruitfully, going to the heart of things, not stopped by their surface,\\n      free of pre - judgements, shearing sophism and prejudice asunder as with a\\n      sharp sword smiting down obscurantism of all kinds as with a mace of\\n      Bhima.\\n      \\n \"Let our brains no longer, like\\n      European infants, be swathed with swaddling clothes; let it have recover\\n      the free and unbound motion of the Gods, let it have not only the\\n      minuteness but the wide mastery and sovereignty natural to the intellect\\n      of Bharata and easily recoverable by it if it once accustomes itself to\\n      feel its own power and be convinced of its own worth.\\n      \\n \"The old fixed foundations have\\n      been broken up, we are tossing in the waters of a great upheaval and\\n      change. It is no use clinging to the old ice - floes of the past, they\\n      will soon melt and leave their refugees struggling in perilous waters. It\\n      is no use landing ourselves in the infirm bog, neither sea nor good, dry\\n      land of a second - hand Europeanism. We shall only die there a miserable\\n      and unclean death.\\n      \\n \"No we must learn to swim and use\\n      that power to reach the good vessel of unchanging truth; we must land\\n      again on the eternal rock of ages.\"\\n      \\n Yes, we must expand, we must assimilate\\n      whatever is assimilable for our growth. Stagnation and contraction are the\\n      signs of Death. Our knowledge must be aggressive, must diffuse through the\\n      rank and file of the whole Homoeopathic profession if we wish to survive\\n      and perpetuate ourselves; to leave an extensive ignorance either below or\\n      around us is to expose ourselves to the perpetual danger of being\\n      exterminated as a professional entity.\\n      \\n In fine, I welcome you, once again, on\\n      this historic occasion to this historic city to deliberate, to exchange\\n      view points and to come to agreed decisions with regard to our future line\\n      of action in respect of Homoeopathy in all its aspects.'\n",
      " 'Tresorie - SOME OBSERVATIONS ON NEURASTHENIA AND ITS TREATMENT\\n[Neurasthenia & Treatment]\\n\\n WHEN, thirty-five years ago, the writer\\n      first made the acquaintance of what is now called neurasthenia, it was\\n      known as spinal irritation, and the best of modern researches have been\\n      unable to give a better definition beyond a functional disturbance of the\\n      spinal and cerebral nerves, dependent on a morbid process, for which\\n      \"irritation\" is as proper a term as any. As deaths do not occur,\\n      autopsies throw no light on the subject. Briefly stated, neurasthenia,\\n      when observed from the beginning through its chronic course, has a period\\n      of prodromal symptoms followed by a protracted acute, and succeeded by a\\n      still more protracted chronic, state, between the end of which and the\\n      beginning of convalescence there is a very vague, often indiscernible,\\n      boundary line.\\n      \\n The prodromal symptoms are quite\\n      indefinite and very variable, pointing to nothing in particular. Loss of\\n      appetite, irregular sleep, excitability alternating with lassitude, etc.,\\n      are often overlooked, especially when the second stage-display of unusual\\n      mental and physical energy without subsequent fatigue- becomes apparent.\\n      This is often mistaken for a sign of unusually good health. When a young\\n      girl or mature woman, married or unmarried, feels that she can study ten\\n      hours a day and devote half of her night to pleasure or business; when\\n      besides much mental occupation she begins to rejoice in long walks without\\n      fatigue, that is the time when the mischief is going on without exciting\\n      timely suspicion. Relief is at last sought when the functional disorder of\\n      the nerves has gone to the opposite extreme, and becomes manifest in what\\n      is properly and popularly termed \"nervous prostration,\" when\\n      instead of having no sense of fatigue, the best bodily or mental effort\\n      seems intolerable, in grave cases rendering the patient a helpless being,\\n      completely dependent on the unremitting assistance of others whom she )it\\n      is usually a woman) rules with the inexorable power of the vis inertiae.\\n      \\n During this usually very protracted\\n      period of the disease convalescence usually sets in, but so imperceptibly\\n      that the physician alone can sometimes estimate its progress, which is\\n      unnoticeable to others towards whom the patient acts as she has for months\\n      or years. This is the time for action, too often delayed from motives of\\n      misplaced sympathy on the part of relatives and friends.\\n      \\n The affections is in many instances\\n      limited to the spine, the mind becoming only secondarily tired. In other\\n      cases it is spinal and cerebral; in others again chiefly cerebral. The\\n      line between this and insanity is always clearly definable. Though a\\n      neurasthenic patient may become insane, and probably the reverse, yet both\\n      are distinct conditions.\\n      \\n Books speak of this disease at common\\n      to men and women. Yet in this region in small towns as well as in large\\n      cities the cases of neurasthenia in women are preponderatingly great.\\n      \\n Hypochondriacs and hysteria stand in\\n      peculiar relation to neurasthenia. They maybe regarded as different\\n      species of the same genus; that is, more or less deeply seated\\n      disturbances of the cerebro-spinal system in which the sympathetic system\\n      is probably indirectly involved, as many functional disturbances presided\\n      over by the great sympathetic system often testify. Hypochondriasis, pure\\n      and simple as occurring in men, is easily distinguishable by its striking\\n      characteristic of introspection and despondency, occasioned by abnormal\\n      sensations, without marked physical weakness and tiredness. Pure\\n      hypochondriacs are often energetic, conscientious workers. In hysteria\\n      there is neither great tiredness nor tendency to introspection, but a\\n      paroxysmal or prolonged absence of the power of self control, in grave\\n      cases associated with tonic or clonic muscular spasm and loss of\\n      consciousness. While neurasthenia in its uncomplicated forms is free from\\n      these symptoms, but, as ample experience teaches, often complicated with\\n      both of the preceding forms to such an extent that it is often very\\n      difficult to tell which is primary and which secondary. The symptoms known\\n      as introspection, hysterical aberrations of the emotions, and neurasthenic\\n      sense of exhaustion are in their distinctive manifestations most important\\n      and constitute indications in the selection of remedial and dietetic\\n      measures.\\n      \\n The following are some observation of\\n      peculiarities observed in a large number of cases and peculiar to all:.\\n      \\n Introspection.-The neurasthenic patient\\n      in variably expresses her desire for relief, not so much in a direct\\n      appeal as in a supplicating, subdued tone of voice and manner. She rarely\\n      asks, \"What can you do to relieve me?\" but almost invariably,\\n      \"What is the cause of\" this or that sensation? If she is\\n      introspective, that is, hypochondriacal, she becomes a nosomaniac,\\n      watching acutely every one of her numerous distressing sensation, on the\\n      unremitting analysis of which her mind dwells. In marked cases she is\\n      quite unable to think of anything outside of herself, and in many cases\\n      dislikes to do so, preferring to river her attention on herself. Attempts\\n      to divert her annoy or anger her. Friends and relatives implore the\\n      physician to divert the patient, but all their attempts are in vain\\n      because quite misdirected.\\n      \\n Positive and Negative Will.-It seems\\n      sometimes as if the patient delights in her self-inspection, and that she\\n      prefers her condition to speedy recovery. This is not the case, for the\\n      patient will always assure the physician of her wish to get well. During\\n      the acute stage-a long yet definable period-this wish and longing cannot\\n      well be utilized, but the long and ill-defined period of convalescence\\n      must first be awaited. Here we shall always discover that the wish and the\\n      will of the patient are two very different mental conditions. The desire\\n      or wish for recovery is entirely unattended by any will effort to\\n      accomplish the desired end. The injunctions and directions of the\\n      physician are resisted by the same unconquerable power of negative power,\\n      or vis inertiae. The patient having been unable to exert her will, now\\n      thinks herself unable to use it.\\n      \\n Numerous Symptoms of Patients.-To\\n      physicians in search of indications for medicines each statement of\\n      patient concerning a sensation is apt to be considered as a symptom. Many\\n      years ago, when resolved to get at the keynote of a patient\\'s case, the\\n      writer determined to allow the patient to detail all her symptoms as long\\n      as she chose and to take accurate notes of each one till the right one\\n      should be disclosed; and this was to be done regardless of time and\\n      exertion. The patient, one who needed no urging to describe her\\n      \"symptoms,\" began in an almost inaudible voice, detailing one\\n      sensation after another with an unrivalled degree of clearness and\\n      vividness of expression; as she proceeded the voice became stronger, her\\n      face slightly flushed, and the most perfect descriptive language flowed in\\n      an endless stream. Each word was written down, page after page was filled;\\n      still she went on with unmistakable signs of satisfaction at being able to\\n      pour her pent-up emotions into willing and sympathetic ears. If, for a\\n      moment, the flow of language was interrupted, a simple question would\\n      re-animate her to proceed with renewed energy. Feelings seemed to beget\\n      feelings; their complexity gave the patient no trouble; her intellect was\\n      equal to the action of unraveling the most complicated sensation,\\n      separating them into their component parts and spreading them out before\\n      the mind of the listener. A glance at the watch showed that nearly two\\n      hours had passed, during which the feeblest of neurasthenic patients had\\n      talked incessantly. The note-book was full, the keynote was found. It was\\n      this: neurasthenic patients have innumerable sensation and exhibit no\\n      sings of fatigue after talking incessantly for nearly two hours.\\n      \\n Great Endurance of Neurasthenics.-The\\n      instance just related, which is one of many, illustrates two things. One\\n      is, that it is not the kind of sensation described but the fact that\\n      neurasthenics have innumerable sensations, that constitute the symptoms.\\n      The other thing is that many neurasthenics are capable of great exertion\\n      without suffering disagreeable after- effects from fatigue. This is\\n      illustrated by other cases of which I have notes. A highly neurasthenic\\n      young lady consented to camp out for her health near a lake. She was\\n      induced to join a party for a short walk along the lake. By trying what\\n      they thought a shorter road the party lost their way and took a very long\\n      walk of about four hours, through bogs and over forces. The neurasthenic\\n      was less fatigued than some of the others. The interesting observation was\\n      subsequently made that the patient had become interested in a young man of\\n      the party. She recovered her health within a year from that time. Other\\n      cases of this kind will appear under the head of therapeutic suggestions.\\n      \\n Neurasthenic Patients Crave\\n      Sympathy.-This is one of the most formidable obstacles to the curative\\n      management of such cases, for the kind of sympathy such patients crave is\\n      expressions of condolence and more or less deep affliction at so much\\n      suffering as the patient expresses. Such sympathy is most natural and does\\n      honor to the feelings of parents, sisters, brothers and husbands, but it\\n      is unfortunate that the deeper their expression of affliction so much the\\n      more profound will be the mental dejection and weakness of the patient.\\n      Almost every case which has come under the writer\\'s observation has been\\n      much hampered if not made hopeless by this condition of things, against\\n      which no remedy suggests itself that would not be construed as\\n      \"unkind\".\\n      \\n The origin of this very formidable and\\n      refractory nervous disease, like that of most diseases usually termed\\n      chronic, is either hereditary or acquired, as the histories of every\\n      observed case plainly testify. Either the father was a hypochondriac or\\n      the mother neurasthenic, or both parents were of unsound nervous\\n      constitution. Dipsomania on the part of parents produces neurasthenia in\\n      the children, as readily as it will be followed by any other form of\\n      nervous disease, according to the individual predisposition of the\\n      offspring. The excessive use of tea and coffee is another very active\\n      factor in the history of neurasthenics. Where fathers inclined to alcohol,\\n      mothers are addicted to tea and coffee, which, while its immediate effects\\n      do not obtrude themselves upon our notice, are none the less insidious in\\n      their more remote consequences.\\n      \\n The acquired forms of neurasthenia are\\n      of utmost interest to the therapeutist, and the sources of acquisition are\\n      readily stated. They are much brain-work with insufficient food and sleep.\\n      Such conditions obtain chiefly in women (less frequently in men) of fine\\n      intellectual ability, conscientiousness and ambition. Physical overwork\\n      with unintellectual women has no such effect. Quite analogous to the above\\n      are the conditions of care and sorrow, especially in women who are able\\n      for a long time to conceal and control their emotions. The usual\\n      consequence of such states of mind is disregard of food and insufficient\\n      sleep. Instances of acquired neurasthenia are presented in families of\\n      several girls and boys, where one or more of the former are Neurasthenic\\n      while the latter are vigorous and athletic. Boys delighting in vigorous\\n      exercise do not, as is the case with girls, lose appetite and sleep.\\n      \\n The effects of nervous exhaustion in\\n      boys are usually much less grave than in girls; as a rule such effects are\\n      manifested in mental, not muscular, tiredness, and they are relieved by\\n      air and exercise, while in girls and women those influences are shunned\\n      because they seem to increase the tiredness.\\n      \\n Predisposition-The temperament, or what\\n      in modern pharaseology is called the personal equation, plays a visible\\n      but uncontrollable part in the progress of neurasthenia, as temperament\\n      greatly determines the other imperfectly known condition known as\\n      predisposition. Where the disease is hereditary, it is easy to say that\\n      the predisposition is due to that source; where there is no history of\\n      heredity and where neurasthenia exists in the last members of a\\n      generation, it may be attributed to acquired predisposition which needed\\n      only the exciting cause to establish the disease in its most typical form.\\n      \\n One of the most common forms of\\n      neurasthenia, often quite intractable, results from a serious defect in\\n      our public school system, one which affects chiefly girls from twelve to\\n      fourteen years of age. The following is a brief example: The child rises\\n      late with no appetite for breakfast and no time to eat it if so inclined.\\n      The lessons, however, have been learned the evening before, and the school\\n      work is begun with an ambitions will and a crammed mind, and continues\\n      with one intermission of often not more than ten minutes or three of four\\n      hours. The pupil arrives at home ravenously hungry, eats too fast, and too\\n      much of injudiciously prepared food, too long in digesting to leave room\\n      for an appetite for even a light evening meal, or even for a breakfast the\\n      next morning.\\n      \\n In another case the girl or boy grows\\n      desperately hungry while at school, but being unprovided with food\\n      (lunch), goes on with the school exercises, at the end of which the sense\\n      of hunger has vanished and has been replaced by an aversion to normal\\n      food, with a possible craving for something pungent and indigestible. This\\n      observation can easily be made in many instances, and will, in as many\\n      cases, be seen to lead to nervous prostration, which is then treated by\\n      vile, patented concoctions consisting largely of whiskey, under the name\\n      of \"tonics,\" while the patient needs only the best that a\\n      legitimate market affords prepared in a sensible manner.\\n      \\n Typical Cases Ending in Rapid\\n      Recovery.-Curative results have already been indicated in what has been\\n      said above, and further indications for treatment may be gathered from a\\n      few cases of extremely rapid recovery of apparently incurable cases, to\\n      which brief allusion will here be made. A woman of forty had been a victim\\n      of grave neurasthenia for five years. In the absence of an inclination to\\n      exert himself, she had, during that period, been mostly confined to her\\n      bed or lounge, in the meantime giving birth to two children, going through\\n      gestation and confinement normally, without recovering from neurasthenic\\n      prostration which, in the course of some years more, rendered her entirely\\n      helpless. Her condition was associated with a feeling of dropping to\\n      pieces unless supported and braced by a harness of wood, iron and leather,\\n      in which she \"sat up\" for several hours each day, spending the\\n      rest of the time in bed. Having left the patient in this condition, it was\\n      reported before the writer\\'s next professional visit that Mrs.-had been\\n      cured, and that she was able to go out like other people. A visit to the\\n      house confirmed the report. The patient came to the door herself, and in a\\n      quiet manner, entirely without the least expression of joy or wonder at\\n      her release, stated, that having heard of a famous \"magnetic\\n      physician,\" she summoned him, was ordered by him to arise and stand;\\n      protesting that it was impossible, she was raised to her feet and again\\n      ordered to stand, then to walk. Fearing that she would fall, she begged\\n      the magnetic doctor to support her, which he peremptorily refused, saying\\n      she might fall if she liked. Instead of falling, she had to walk about the\\n      room, was then placed upon a lounge and subjected to a severe treatment of\\n      rolling and pummelling, and then ordered to dress and sit up until tired,\\n      to remain up and about like other people, and to call on the doctor in\\n      future, as he would not come so far to the patient again. This happened\\n      about twenty-five years ago, and the patient has been in very fair health\\n      arrested by insisting that all professional visits by the writer or any\\n      other physician to whose sympathy the patient could appeal must cease.\\n      This injunction was carried out conscientiously with the best results by\\n      the husband of the patient. Perhaps we may learn from this that sometimes,\\n      at least, the familiar motto is reversed, and angels rush in where fools\\n      fear to tread.\\n      \\n Profiting by this experience, another\\n      neurasthenic woman, unmarried, but of most intractable, antagonistic\\n      temperament, confined to her bed, in and out of hospitals, for years,\\n      wearing out the strength and means of her relatives and the patience of\\n      many physicians, was at length abandoned by them. It was a case of spinal\\n      and cerebral neurasthenia complicated with hypochondriasis in its most\\n      trying form of introspective maunderings and endless description of\\n      symptoms. She tormented her advisers by her endless tirades, the\\n      indulgence of which invariably aggravated her condition, and were there\\n      fore avoided, until once her physician yielded to the patient\\'s\\n      importunities for a visit, when be found her in her usual abject state of\\n      prostration. Guided by experience derived from cases like the one first\\n      described, he assisted the patient to her feet and marched her, will you\\n      nil you, up and down the room until he, at least, was thoroughly tired,\\n      and then departed with the promise never to do so again. The patient, on\\n      her part, made a number of her unnameable promises, but kept on her feet\\n      and let the doctors alone. Though not cured of deeply-rooted morbid mental\\n      faults, the neurasthenic phase of her condition had yielded to the change\\n      of the antagonistic element of her character from passive to very\\n      practical activity. A third very serious case of this kind occurred in the\\n      person of a girl of fifteen, of selfish character, who gradually became\\n      bed-ridden with spinal and cerebral neurasthenia, and tormented with the\\n      usual multifarious painful sensations, none of which, on the most\\n      pains-taking physical examination, resulted from demonstrable organic\\n      disease of genital or abdominal organs. The patient was most tenderly\\n      cared for by her mother, who, in the course of years, became so imbued\\n      with the idea of yielding to every wish and whim of the patient, that at\\n      length remonstrance became useless. The mother, though recognizing the\\n      importance of persuading or urging her daughter to depend more on herself,\\n      admitted that she had yielded so long that now she must continue to feed,\\n      dress and assist her charge in the most trivial things. Her food had to be\\n      placed in her mouth, the position of a hand or foot changed by some one\\n      else, although patient did so spontaneously when she chose. This went on\\n      for fifteen years, when the mother, growing old and feeble, died. Her\\n      maternal support being gone, the patient at once proved her ability to\\n      walk, to dress, to feed herself, and to seek light employment. Though far\\n      from well, she is equally far fro being a helpless, bed-ridden invalid.\\n      \\n A fourth case, still very vividly\\n      impressed on the writer\\'s mind, was one of a healthy, romping girl of 14,\\n      who, as happen in this remarkably capricious disease, in the midst of\\n      perfect health, one day took to her bed and remained there with all the\\n      symptoms of neurasthenia, involving first the spinal and finally the\\n      cerebral nerves. This patient was very amiable, conscientious, and\\n      sensible, never loquacious, and not troubled with hypochondriacal thoughts\\n      or sensations. Tiredness was the only expression she used in describing\\n      her feelings. There was literally no variation from this condition, which\\n      confined her to her bed for years, till she grew from a girl to a woman.\\n      Eating and sleeping well, and improving perceptibly in personal appearance\\n      and character, yet she lay on her couch tired and watched over with\\n      unremitting care by a most anxious mother, showing her solicitude and\\n      sympathy in every feature. Once, in the second year of the disease, a\\n      favorable interruption occurred. The mother, still a young woman, gave\\n      birth to another child. During her confinement the neurasthenic patient\\n      was in charge of her mother\\'s nurse, assisted by other servants. The\\n      nurse, while devoted to the daughter, agreed with the writer that excess\\n      of sympathy was injurious, and used her best and judicious endeavors\\n      gradually to persuade the patient to make some physical effort at walking\\n      and standing. In this she was so successful that in two weeks she\\n      accompanied the girl on half-mile walks up and down hill, finally without\\n      assistance. Thus, recovery seemed assured, and everything was favorable\\n      progressing towards it when the mother, having fully recovered, again took\\n      charge of her daughter, with the result that she at once took to her\\n      lounge and remained there two years longer. About that time other advice\\n      was urged and gladly acceded to, with the result that the case was\\n      diagnosed by an eminent surgeon as spinal paralysis in consequence of\\n      concussion, though it could never be shown when and where it occurred.\\n      Salves, plasters, anodynes, nervines, and electricity did no good, but\\n      effectually destroyed appetite and digestion, which higher to had been\\n      normal. So this adviser resigned in favor of a third, who, being a younger\\n      and less prejudiced man, agreed perfectly with the writer\\'s original\\n      opinion. He advised return to moderate exercise, avoidance of drugs, and\\n      less display of sympathy. This, though formerly rejected as\\n      \"unkind,\" was now acceded to as coming from a nerve- specialist,\\n      fresh from Europe, at that time very rare. Still attending the other\\n      members of the family, the writer had sample opportunity of observing the\\n      course of the case. Improvement was very slow and uncertain till financial\\n      misfortune overtook the family. Almost with a bound our patient left her\\n      cough, and, organizing a kindergarten, strove energetically in supporting\\n      herself and assisting her mother. The change came about in less than three\\n      weeks, and resulted in perfect recovery.\\n      \\n At this point another very instructive\\n      case of very speedy recovery, after six or seven years of neurasthenic\\n      prostration, deserves to be mentioned. A woman of 35 had been in bed and\\n      on the lounge most of the time for nearly seven years, at the end of which\\n      time she became my patient, her regular medical attendant having gone to\\n      Europe. She was of very amiable disposition and as sensitive as she was\\n      weak. Her symptoms, as in the other cases, were instantaneous exhaustion\\n      on the least physical exertion. She could give herself up to no mental\\n      occupation beyond directing her house-hold affairs, the education of her\\n      son, and the rehearsal of her numerous sensations. She had not been my\\n      patient long when her husband failed in business, so that the family was\\n      reduced from very comfortable circumstances to a condition which made it\\n      necessary for the patient to make her own living and that of the family.\\n      This she almost at once proceeded to do, setting aside all other\\n      considerations and establishing a boarding-house, where she did most of\\n      the work herself. This she has done now for ten or twelve years without a\\n      serious relapse. The time involved in the period of convalescence was\\n      scarcely more than three weeks, a although her work maybe said to have\\n      begun at the moment her resolution was taken.\\n      \\n Prognostics.-From these and other cases\\n      in and outside of the writer\\'s practice, it is safe to say that the\\n      majority of cases of neurasthenia recover, though years may elapse before\\n      that period. We learn, furthermore, that recoveries, especially of very\\n      inveterate cases, depend on conditions beyond the control of the\\n      physician, as was the case in the above-recorded instances, where\\n      circumstances forced the patient to cases to wish for recovery and to make\\n      an effort of the will. This having been once accomplished self-confidence,\\n      for a long time in abeyance, was permanently restored.\\n      \\n Curability, further, depends very much\\n      on the temperament of the patient, whether amiable, tractable and\\n      confiding in the honest endeavors of the physician, or whether refractory,\\n      suspicious, untruthful, selfish and antagonistic, of a disposition\\n      impossible to win over on account of unnatural distrust of every\\n      well-meaning person. The degree of intelligence of patients also has a\\n      pronounced influence on the result. The most readily curable cases are\\n      those acquired without hereditary predisposition, where the cause is found\\n      in the absence of food and sleep, also where sorrow and anxiety can be\\n      averted or counteracted by judicious conduct of near relatives and\\n      friends.\\n      \\n Dietetic Treatment.-This, as medicinal\\n      treatment, must be governed by the stage at which the case comes into the\\n      physician\\'s hands-whether yet in its prodromal, its acute or its chronic\\n      phase. The prodromal stage of the disease has no very decided\\n      pathognomonic signs. The most that can be recognized in this stage is that\\n      the patient\\'s habits or duties are of a kind which will eventually lead to\\n      obdurate neurasthenia if not arrested in time by removing the exciting\\n      causes. Too much pleasure, as well as too much care, especially in girls\\n      and woman, tends to neglect of food and rest, in the absence of which,\\n      excitements, whether of pleasure or care, begets a state of unrest in\\n      which repose is disagreeable. With such a condition comes a list of\\n      incipient casual complaints of headache, imperfect sleep, notional ways of\\n      eating, working or playing. A few questions will determine whether the\\n      patient is living according to normal or abnormal habits with regard to\\n      appetite, sleep and occupation. Where these are found, their alteration to\\n      normal ways must be instead on. It is unnecessary to say that this is\\n      easier said than done, for it will probably meet with serious objections\\n      on the part of the patient, if not on that of her relatives; for most\\n      likely she has examinations for college to prepare for, involving several\\n      months of dose and careful study at night, and the patient cannot waste\\n      time in sleeping and eating while cramming that little excited and\\n      ambitions brain. A failure in the examinations would be as much of a\\n      disappointment to parents as to patient, who proves, as usual, that this\\n      appellation is a misnomer. She accordingly goes in as she please, lied by\\n      an increasing morbidly ambitions impulse, and the result is likely to be\\n      the mournful satisfaction on the part of the physician of being obliged to\\n      say, \"I told you before what would happen.\" Of course, all\\n      regret the now evident nerve-prostration, while, if the doctor had\\n      succeeded in enforcing his rules, he would in many cases experience the\\n      still more painful reproach of having been too severe. Nevertheless,\\n      absolute firmness and a kindly but unflinching exertion of his will,\\n      without the least compromise, reward the physician with the best results\\n      in such cases.\\n      \\n When the case, after the stage of\\n      excitement and untiring restlessness (at which it would still be speedily\\n      curable by simple dietetic rules) has, after weeks or months, entered upon\\n      the phase of painful prostration, here we encounter backache, oppressive\\n      headache, and absolute loss of mental or bodily endurance, measures of\\n      dietetic management are much less effective and much more difficult to\\n      find. it is at this stage that slight rise of temperature will occur,\\n      especially towards evening; then the backache and headache disappear, the\\n      pallor is replaced by a flush of color, the eyes lose their listless look,\\n      and the patient is inclined to enter upon some diversion or excitement,\\n      followed by a restless night and a morning of exhaustion and a renewal of\\n      all painful sensations. Most of such patients feel much better in the\\n      evening when they are ready for some entertainment, while in a normal\\n      state this would be the time for relaxation and repose.\\n      \\n The dietetic treatment of this stage is\\n      methodical rest. In severe cases the patient will do well to remain in bed\\n      for several days or even for weeks. It is well to shorten this period as\\n      much as possible and to insist on walking about, or, at least. sitting for\\n      a specified time every day. This may be varied b equally specified periods\\n      of rest in the recumbent position.\\n      \\n Irregularities of eating are at this\\n      and at all times to be superseded by the most rigid regularity of meals.\\n      The traditional and conventional three-meal system, however well adapted\\n      to the needs of a vigorous man or woman, does not agree with the\\n      neurasthenic patient. It is much better that these should eat oftener;\\n      four times a day is best in most cases, for the simple reason that in this\\n      way a patient, while eating less at a time, consumes more food in the\\n      aggregate.\\n      \\n As neurasthenic patients are rarely\\n      troubled with absolute aversion to wholesome food, they are generally able\\n      to consume a liberal quantity, about which it is only needful to remark\\n      here that the food should be selected from among the articles and dishes\\n      which the patient likes, provided they belong to the order of good, normal\\n      articles of food, to the exclusion of those which simply please the taste\\n      without being digestible. A dish entirely of meat or \"animal\\n      food\" is as far from being a good diet for neurasthenics as one\\n      consisting entirely of \"vegetable\" food. As a rule, the diet\\n      list should comprise one-third of nitrogenous material and two-thirds of\\n      carbohydrates. Together with these, it is a great mistake to neglect the\\n      fats, such as good butter and the fats of meats. And, lastly, every\\n      patient of this kind should be made to drink some water often, a dietetic\\n      feature too often neglected.\\n      \\n During this stage, actually fatiguing\\n      exercise of body and mind should be avoided, while, on the other hand, the\\n      patient\\'s mind should be directed away from herself, in which she is much\\n      assisted by withholding a certain kind of emotional sympathy, quite as\\n      natural as it is difficult to repress on the part of affectionate persons.\\n      Of this, a few words further on.\\n      \\n There is no definite time for the\\n      duration of this stage, which, however, depends largely on the time during\\n      which the exciting causes have acted, either aided by or without a\\n      predisposition. It is certain, however, that the sooner it is recognized\\n      and the exciting causes eliminated, so much the sooner recovery will\\n      begin. But there is a stage at which the best of experience and judgment\\n      often fail, especially in very inveterate cases. If the case is one of a\\n      patient whom the physician has had opportunity of watching at least since\\n      the earlier stages, the difficulty is not so great as it is in old cases\\n      months or even of several years\\' duration which come to treatment late. In\\n      these, the line between the intermediate stage and incipient convalescence\\n      cannot be drawn. The patient is as neurasthenic and hypochondriacal as\\n      ever; cannot bear the slightest mental or bodily exertion, not even a word\\n      or a look, without sings of apparent exhaustion, while nearly the whole\\n      time is spent in bed under anxious care of sympathetic attendants. In such\\n      cases, having become assured, by careful physical examination, of the\\n      absence of organic disease, seeing the patient generally well nourished\\n      and in fair muscular condition, the physician is warranted in assuming\\n      that the disease has run its course, that whatever morbid (pathological)\\n      process there may have been progressing in the nervous system, this\\n      process has now come to and end, but it has left the patient\\'s mental\\n      condition habituated to the moods of the past months or years, and fixed,\\n      as it were, indelibly in the memory. It is the habit that now remains, not\\n      the disease.\\n      \\n If reasonably sure of this, and calling\\n      to mind the rapid recoveries and the circumstances attending them, as\\n      above detailed, the physician is now safe in ordering a more energetic\\n      treatment, calculated to rouse the self-reliance of the patient. All\\n      visible signs of sympathy must now be set aside; the actins and demeanor\\n      of the attendants should, from this time, if not before, be changed so as\\n      to give the patient the impression that she is no longer an invalid, but\\n      expected to rely on her own exertion. Instead of being fed, the food\\n      should be placed where she must go for and eat it. She should now be\\n      expected to dress and attend, without assistance, to her natural wants.\\n      This, with some temperaments, is almost impossible, with al extremely\\n      difficult. The best course to pursue is to remove such patients from\\n      sympathetic relatives or friends, and to place them in charge of kind,\\n      reliable, but eminently practical nurses.\\n      \\n The first effect of this is either to\\n      throw the patient into a stage of helpless despondency, which, again\\n      appealing powerfully to the sympathies of those nearest to her, often\\n      frustrates the physician\\'s plans which, if firmly but kindly adhered to,\\n      would, ere long, prove of their superiority by signs of returning\\n      self-reliance and absence of complaints on the part of the patient. A\\n      second form of effect is that occurring in patients of obstreperous,\\n      selfish disposition, whose opposition and even anger is aroused by being\\n      thrown on their own resources after the removal of depressing and\\n      unpractical sympathy. This opposition or temper, often manifested in all\\n      sorts of intrigues and subterfuges on the part of the patient, if not\\n      supinely yielded to by sympathetic persons, will finally be replaced by a\\n      more rational disposition. On the whole, anger or active opposition are\\n      signs of returning energy, which, once coming to the consciousness of the\\n      patient, takes the form of self- reliance. it is this way that the cures\\n      of chronic cases above related can be explained, and physicians should\\n      profit by such experience for the benefit of their patients.\\n      \\n The general dietetic management now\\n      readily follows from what has been said, and needs only a few general\\n      modifications. The first duty of the physician will be to test the degree\\n      of reliance to be placed on the patient and her friends, ad to win them\\n      over if possible to his plans, and his success will be in proportion to\\n      the degree of confidence he is able to inspire. This personal confidence\\n      should not degenerate into a mere personal liking or attachment of a\\n      sympathy-craving neurasthenic who should discover henceforth that all\\n      sentimental expressing of sympathy are about to take a practical form,\\n      aiming at a definite result-the patient\\'s health-which she wishes but\\n      cannot exert her will to attain. The best and often the only way to do\\n      away with sentiment and to reach practical kindness is to remove the\\n      patient from certain home influence, and to place her in a hospital or\\n      elsewhere under the management of competent nurses who, without being\\n      selfish, know how to exert a certain amount of wholesome push as fast as\\n      the patient can bear it. Without the removal of sentimental sympathy, all\\n      efforts at counteracting the purely hypochondriacal side of neurasthenia\\n      are useless.\\n      \\n In these cases of neurasthenia as yet\\n      uncomplicated with the hypochondriacal element of introspective nosomania,\\n      there is only one unconditional rule to be followed, especially in\\n      acquired cases whose evident cause was incessant, conscientious work of\\n      mind and body, together with insufficient food and sleep. Such cases come\\n      on very insidiously, the loss of strength-that is, the actual waste of\\n      nerve-substance-being just a trifle grater than the quantity restored, the\\n      patient unconsciously using up a minute part of her capital every day.\\n      Here the rule should be to reverse matters to insuring a supply of\\n      nourishment and time for its assimilation greater than was the case\\n      heretofore. The case of young school-girls belong in this class. The time\\n      of food and rest should be carefully controlled at home, the duty of the\\n      physician being to educate indifferent and ignorant parents up to an\\n      appreciation of the nature of the case. It is generally not difficult to\\n      open their eyes through the medium of their anxiety concerning their\\n      children\\'s health. Having thus insured sufficient rest and food at home,\\n      the physician\\'s next object of attention should be the regulations of the\\n      school. Here is the point where teachers have an opportunity of exerting\\n      their most practical influence. It should be made obligatory on the part\\n      of teachers to institute inquiry as to whether pupils have had their meals\\n      before coming to school. This they could often ascertain without a\\n      question, by reading the pupil\\'s condition in her emaciated form, pale\\n      face and nervous manner. To guard against neglect at home, it would be an\\n      easy matter to insist that all pupils of public and private schools should\\n      bring with them some proper food. The few who do so generally bring\\n      sweets-an apple, orange or a few dry crackers-when a piece of good bread\\n      and slice of cold meat would be what they actually need. All pupils should\\n      pass inspection, and if remiss in this important particular, the\\n      delinquent should be dismissed with several marks against her. To expect\\n      this of teachers would be a great advance in the place of futile\\n      innovations of endeavoring to send forth from our common schools graduates\\n      in arts and sciences.\\n      \\n Sudden Effects.-A large number of cases\\n      of neurasthenia, especially those complicated with inveterate\\n      Hypochondriasis, are frequently traced to some sudden occurrence, having\\n      the effect of a mental or physical shock. In one patient, a vigorous girl,\\n      used to romping, climbing and running lie a boy, the cause was supposed to\\n      be a slight thump she received during a game of blindman\\'s-buff. She\\n      thought nothing of it at the time, but it was suggested long after the\\n      patient\\'s illness began. In another case some mental shock of joy or\\n      grief, not very severe and such as is often experienced in every person\\'s\\n      life, is the beginning of months of nervous prostration.\\n      \\n There is quite an array of evidence\\n      that neurasthenia which has entered upon a hypochondriacal stage or\\n      complication with or without a strong hysterical admixture, is curable by\\n      sudden impressions in the form of a shock, or more gradually by frequent\\n      repetitions of an impression. Such cases, as I have shown above, occur\\n      most commonly in the stage when what may be considered the essential\\n      pathological disturbances of function have run their course and have left\\n      the patient in a state of mental disturbance which indicated that the\\n      patient\\'s recovery depends entirely upon her volition. But there is none,\\n      and so far nothing has succeeded in arousing it. Persuasion is as useless\\n      and irritating, as argument would be in a case of insanity with a fixed\\n      illusion. The resemblance between this and the state of mind of a\\n      hypochondriacal neurasthenic is very close. She cannot move nor thick.\\n      Exhaustion overcomes her and keeps her its victim for years, when suddenly\\n      the scene changes, and a few days or weeks suffice to restore the patient\\n      to activity. In one instance it is attributed to medical, in another to\\n      \"mind cure,\" in a third to \"Christian science;\" in\\n      still other cases massage has done it, in others again \"magnetic\\n      influence,\" in others the very powerful factor necessity. It is\\n      certain that cases of this kind, produced by sudden effects on the mind of\\n      a predisposed person, are also cured by such effects. Whatever the visible\\n      form of these effects may be -whether that of \"Christian\\n      science,\" joy, grief or absolute inexorable necessity, there is\\n      always to be noticed a certain force and condition involving the modern\\n      idea of suggestion, which comes to the patient in an irresistible degree\\n      and now sets the function of the will in motion again.\\n      \\n Experience teaches that it is by no\\n      means a matter of indifference which of these forms of effect are brought\\n      into action. In one case it is the professional Christian scientist\\'s\\n      method, in another the almost brutal exertion of a person\\'s will combined\\n      with some physical force. In either case the patient is aroused from his\\n      inertia, and discovers his powers of mental and bodily ability to act.\\n      \\n A deplorable result is that recoveries\\n      after such effects are attributed in the popular mind to supernatural\\n      causes. That such is not the case may be gathered form instances occurring\\n      in very sensible and intelligent patients, whose reason is scarcely ever\\n      so far disturbed and weakened that they do not resent the proposition of\\n      trying, e.g., Christian science or mind cure.\\n      \\n Nevertheless, it is the mind cure which\\n      the intelligent patient needs quite as much as the ignorant and\\n      superstitious person; the difference is only the form in which the\\n      influencing force is applied. While in one case it is obedience to the\\n      candidly expressed instructions of the physician, in the other case the\\n      result is the to mystification. In either case it is the powerful stimulus\\n      of hope and aroused confidence that recovery will be realized.\\n      \\n The definition of suggestion does not\\n      fully cover the meaning, because the influence employed is greater than\\n      mere suggestion. The physician\\'s plan of action should be straightforward\\n      assurance of recovery, a direct appeal to hope, and an unceasing endeavor\\n      to arouse the self-reliance of the patient, not so much by verbal\\n      exhortations as by a manner and department from which the patient learns\\n      more readily than from words what is expected. If the attitude of the\\n      physician is appreciated, and seconded by the relatives and attendants, a\\n      favorable result is much more certain to follow.\\n      \\n Hypnotism is not advisable. There are\\n      now existing ancient neurasthenic invalids dating from the times of\\n      spiritualism when they were famous \"mediums.\" Hypnotism weakness\\n      the will and nervous endurance, and produces a predisposition to emotional\\n      nervousness with an intractable erotic admixture. The suggestions sought\\n      to be instilled into a hypnotized patient amount to nothing. The mental\\n      influence of mystical treatment administered while the patients is awake\\n      is much more powerful in awaking hope and confidence than the uncertain\\n      effects of an abnormal state like that of hypnotism. Mystification, again,\\n      though sometimes unavoidable with the best intention, is less powerful\\n      than direct and intelligible encouragement. While resort to mystification\\n      should be shunned by reputable physicians, the question arises as to what\\n      shall be done with the many who, from lack of intelligence or education,\\n      are entirely beyond the reach of honest common sense, and who will persist\\n      in mystifying themselves, who remain neurasthenic invalids in spite of the\\n      best regulations of the physician, and who do not recover unless their\\n      encouragement follows some mystical formalities which alone arouse their\\n      \"faith\" and finally their confidence and will-power. For the\\n      present there is no way out of the dilemma but to submit such patients to\\n      the suggestive methods of what is popularly known as mind cure and\\n      Christian science. In doing so, physicians should use their influence as\\n      far as possible in selecting the most honest persons of this class.\\n      \\n DISCUSSION.\\n      \\n JAMES C. WOOD, M.D.: I have nothing but\\n      words of praise for Dr. Wesselhoeft\\'s excellent paper. It is very evident\\n      that the author\\'s inspiration came not from books but from actual contact\\n      with neurasthenic subjects, for the impress of originality is most\\n      conspicuous. It is a production which could only come from one of\\n      experience and from a reasoner. I consider it a most valuable contribution\\n      to the literature of that now most interesting subject,\\n      \"neurasthenia\".\\n      \\n The doctor, in his paper, has sometimes\\n      used the term \"neurasthenia\" instead of\\n      \"neurasthenia.\" The first of these means, according to Thomas,\\n      great nervous power or excitement; the second, nervous debility. I taken\\n      it from the context that the subject dealt with is neurasthenia. To the\\n      average mind there exists what seems to me a needless confusion regarding\\n      the terms, nervous prostration, hysteria and hystero-neurosis. As I\\n      understand these terms they define distinct conditions, though there is a\\n      frequent blending the one with the other. The term nervous prostration,\\n      which is a synonym of neurasthenia, defines itself; the term hysteria\\n      should be restricted to those general neuroses characterized particularly\\n      by psychical manifestations, though not infrequently by motor, sensory,\\n      secretory, vasomotor and reflex derangements as well; while the term\\n      hysteroneurosis implies the uterine origin of symptoms manifesting\\n      themselves in organs remote from the uterus without structural changes in\\n      such organs, being the direct result of reflex nervous influence starting\\n      from the uterus. The last term does not occur in the paper under\\n      discussion. From the standpoint of a gynecologist I think that this is\\n      misleading.\\n      \\n Let us see why and how it is that these\\n      three conditions (I will not call them diseases) are so frequently\\n      associated. I think that all will admit the frequent occurrence in woman\\n      of reflex symptoms, the result of pelvic lesions. An irritation staring\\n      form the pelvis is conveyed to the genito-spinal centre, thence to any or\\n      all organs with which this centre communicates. The organ oftener involved\\n      than any other is the stomach. This is shown by the frequent occurrence of\\n      nausea and vomiting following conception. The nervous system may have been\\n      previously involved, but oftener it becomes so only after the nutrition is\\n      depraved, which, sooner or later, occurs if the pelvic lesion is not\\n      removed. The depraved blood fails to supply the nerve centres with that\\n      which they need to sustain them, and they become anaemic. Prostration is\\n      but a subjective manifestation of the anaemia, and it varies in degree\\n      from a slight indisposition to the most abject helplessness.\\n      \\n If, then, nervous prostration may have\\n      its beginning in a pelvic lesion, is it possible for a pelvic lesion to be\\n      inaugurated by systemic disturbances? Personally, I believe that it is,\\n      and offer this explanation as the modus operandi by which such a lesion is\\n      induced: Marked circulatory changes nearly always attend nervous\\n      prostration. The circulation is presided over by the vaso-motor system,\\n      and wear and repair depend upon the proper regulation of this system. If\\n      it becomes disturbed, the bloodvessels dilate or contract unduly, with\\n      resulting local hyperaemia or local anaemia, as the case maybe. The\\n      climacteric flushes are the result of such disturbance. The alternate\\n      coldness and heat of the extremities, so often associated with rectal and\\n      uterine lesions, is another familiar illustration. If the brain is\\n      involved, either insomnia or drowsiness occur, depending upon whether the\\n      brain is anaemic or hyperaemic. Flatulence, gastralgia, and nervous\\n      dyspepsia result when the stomach is similarly affected. The womb and the\\n      ovaries, because of the periodical congestion imposed upon them, are\\n      oftener implicated by these unnatural circulatory disturbances than any of\\n      the pelvic organs, and in time also become unduly hyperaemic or anaemic,\\n      as the case may be.\\n      \\n It will thus be seen that nervous\\n      prostration may exist independently of pelvic lesions, or, conversely,\\n      pelvic lesions may exist independently of nervous prostration.\\n      Nevertheless, the two are frequently associated, and this fact ought, I\\n      believe, to be kept in mind in dealing with the affection known as\\n      neurasthenia. Hysterical manifestations nearly always come to the surface\\n      in nervous prostration, and they also frequently attend pelvic lesions.\\n      Indeed, the term \"hystero-psychosis\" has been coined for the\\n      purpose of defining certain psychical disturbances of presumably pelvic\\n      origin, and in the broadest sense neurasthenia is not uncommonly an\\n      hysteroneurosis. It is the frequent association of these three conditions\\n      which, it seems to me, makes it more practicable to study them conjointly.\\n      \\n The special symptoms of nervous\\n      prostration are most variable. Introspection, as Dr. Wesselhoeft has\\n      pointed out, makes of the patient a nosomaniac. The anaemic nerve centres\\n      are unduly impressionable, and a mental shock which would not seriously\\n      affect a stronger and more rugged woman falls with crushing force upon one\\n      whose nutrition is already depraved. In this way are developed disorders\\n      of sensibility, alternations of mobility, circulatory disturbances,\\n      anomalies of secretion and exertion, disorders of the gastro-intestinal\\n      canal, dermatoses, and general and psychical disturbances of all kinds.\\n      Many of these affections start from pelvic lesions, and are nearly always\\n      associated with depravity of nutrition and more or less nervous\\n      prostration.\\n      \\n Some of the worst symptoms of\\n      neurasthenia with which I have had to contend have been hyperaesthesia of\\n      the articulations, giving rise to the so-called \"hysterical\\n      joint.\" Here the prostration is usually not profound, and it is\\n      possible to apply the somewhat energetic treatment recommended by Dr.\\n      Wesselhoeft. I remember one case very distinctly, the detailed history of\\n      which I shall give in another place, which brought me much reputation\\n      because of the \"remarkable\" cure I was fortunate enough to make.\\n      \\n The patient, a beautiful girl of\\n      eighteen, had been bed- ridden for three years with supposed hip-joint\\n      disease. She was in college before assuming the ride of an invalid, and\\n      worried much over her studies and work. She sustained a fall a short time\\n      previously to taking to her bed, and to this fall the injury to the hip\\n      was attributed. She had been from physician to physician and from\\n      sanitarium to sanitarium without receiving benefit. All of the numerous\\n      medical men under whose care she had been, directed their attention to the\\n      hip and applied the classical treatment for morbus coxarius without avail.\\n      The patient had finally reached a point where introspection was her chief\\n      occupation and her mind dwelt almost continually upon a \"diseased\\n      hip.\" She was finally brought to me, coming in an invalid\\'s chair and\\n      looking the very picture of dependency. There was a slight degree of\\n      anaemia, though this was not marked. Notwithstanding the expression\\n      expression of abjectness the girl did not look seriously ill. The hip was\\n      excessively tender upon pressure, but there was no local increase of\\n      temperature, no evidences of fever and suppuration, and forcible\\n      apposition by striking the heel was not very painful. More less spastic\\n      contraction of the flexor muscles of the affected side existed, which gave\\n      to the limb an appearance of actual shortening, which was very deceptive.\\n      Hysterical symptoms were common. On examination I found the left ovary\\n      exquisitely tender. Compression of the ovary increased the pain in the hip\\n      most decidedly and gave rise to much nervous agitation. I did not,\\n      therefore, deem it wise to recommend local treatment other than the daily\\n      use of the hot douche. She had long been a victim of ovarian\\n      dysmenorrhoea. I placed upon the ankle of the affected limb three pounds\\n      of bar-lead, prescribed a pair of crutches and insisted upon her walking.\\n      The lead was used to overcome the spastic contraction as well as for its\\n      moral effect. I did not deem the joint lesion of such a character as to\\n      used extension. In two months\\' time this patient discarded her crutches\\n      for a cane. Six weeks later she put up the cane and is now perfectly well.\\n      \\n This was a case in which somewhat harsh\\n      measures were eminently appropriate.\\n      \\n In marked contrast to the case just\\n      recorded is the following: Mrs.-, aet. 47, widow for twenty years. She is\\n      a devoted church-woman, and for years was a leader in all charitable work\\n      done in the community in which she resided. Through friends she was urged\\n      to consult me, and I think that the call to the neighboring town in which\\n      she lived was countermanded at least four or five times before the finally\\n      mustered up courage and strength enough to see me. Upon reaching the\\n      bedside I found my patient in a room made dark by closed blinds, over\\n      which were hung heavy blankets to shut out every ray of light. The mirror\\n      was turned toward the wall for fear a ray of light might strike it and\\n      flesh throughout the darkened room. Nor did the patient rest under these\\n      extreme precautions, for the eyes were protected with two pairs of colored\\n      glasses with side attachments. Hyperaesthesia of the sense of hearing was\\n      equally marked and the noise was excluded from the room by double doors\\n      whose keyholes were stuffed with cotton. She l so had her ears filled with\\n      cotton, over which she wore ear-mufflers. She was emaciated to an extreme\\n      degree, and had been reduced to her miserable condition by a series of\\n      events which frequently precede profound neurasthenia. Her husband was\\n      killed during the war, and she was left childless. Twelve months previous\\n      to taking to her bed she nursed her mother through a long and fatal\\n      illness. This greatly prostrated her, yet she kept up until a favorite\\n      brother-in-law was thrown from a carriage and killed. This was the last\\n      straw, and the shock compelled her to take to her bed. In due time loss of\\n      appetite with irritability of the stomach developed, which, of course, led\\n      to marked depravity of nutrition. With the anaemia came hyperaesthesia of\\n      the special senses, spinal irritation, headache, hysterical\\n      manifestations, etc. There was no series pelvic lesion, although she had\\n      been much treated for an alleged uterine displacement with congestion.\\n      Unfortunately, she was encouraged, instead of discouraged, in her\\n      invalidism, and she soon became a nosomaniac of the worst type. She had\\n      written down her symptoms one at a time, and the record is such a typical\\n      one that I should like to give it in full, but time forbids.\\n      \\n With great difficulty the patient was\\n      moved on a cough to a private hospital and placed under the Weir Mitchell\\n      treatment. I ignored the pelvic trouble entirely. It is unnecessary to\\n      give in detail the progress of the case from day to day after this\\n      treatment was inaugurated. Suffice it to say that the improvement was of\\n      the most marked character, and in six weeks from the time she entered the\\n      hospital she walked to her carriage with her eyes and ears unprotected.\\n      She soon resumed her church and charitable work, in which she again takes\\n      much delight.\\n      \\n This woman wanted to get well. She was\\n      a woman of pure motives and high ideals. She had, in the language of Dr.\\n      Wesselhoeft, the wish, but, unaided, not the will. She required the aid of\\n      an intelligent, strong-minded, nurse who could bring to her exercise\\n      applied in such a way as to enable her to assimilate food without the\\n      expenditure of nerve force. She co- operated with her physician and nurse\\n      in every possible way, and as soon as the anaemic nerve cells became\\n      flushed with new blood she began to improve. To have commanded this\\n      patient \"to take up her bed and walk\" before improving her\\n      nutrition would have been as unscientific as to have placed the first\\n      patient in bed with extension and counter-extension applied to the limb. I\\n      know of no class of cases requiring for their successful treatment more\\n      tact and discrimination than that under consideration.\\n      \\n I feel confident that I have many times\\n      cut the affection short in its prodromal stage by removing the girl from\\n      college work and insisting upon open-air exercise. Static electricity has,\\n      in my hands, proved exceedingly useful both during the prodromal stage and\\n      that of convalescence.\\n      \\n I will conclude by saying that I have\\n      been impressed with the frequency with which an hereditary history of\\n      epilepsy has been met with in the cases of neurasthenia passing under my\\n      observation.'\n",
      " 'Tresorie - SOME OF THE DISEASES PREVENTING AND COMPLICATION PREGNANCY\\n[Diseases Preventing & Complicating Pregnancy]\\n\\n STERILITY.-DeSinety, Treub, Furbinger,\\n      et al., attribute 50 per cent. of unproductive marriages to the husbands,\\n      saying that sterility in the male is more often the cause of barren\\n      marriages than is generally supposed.\\n      \\n This cause of sterility I pass by, as\\n      also sterility due to mechanical obstruction, incomplete ovulation and the\\n      numerous other causes of this condition, too manifold for mere\\n      enumeration, to consider obesity as a causative agent in this condition. I\\n      need not say that the advocates for surgical interference for the relief\\n      of this condition are legion. Sims makes the assertion that sterility can\\n      be cured by surgical means only. That, of course, is Allopathic arguing\\n      pure and simple. Cases requiring surgical interference do arise, but any\\n      treatment which raises the nutrition of the entire organism, improves the\\n      blood-formation, and favors the resorption of pathological products in the\\n      sexual organs, is to be regarded as the indicated remedy.\\n      \\n Published statements are my authority\\n      for saying that excellent results have followed the administration of\\n      drugs, nevertheless; and in complete defiance of all therapeutic measures,\\n      a certain percentage of women remain barren; for with the more occult\\n      causes of sterility we remain, as yet, unacquainted, consequently they\\n      cannot all be reached with say kind of treatment whatever.\\n      \\n The following case I report somewhat in\\n      detail. Whilst not an exceptional case at all, it bears directly upon the\\n      subject under consideration, and possesses, it seems to me, some decidedly\\n      interesting features. My object in selecting this particular one is to\\n      call attention, if possible, to a condition not sufficiently considered.\\n      Mrs. J., aet. 26, married about two years and a half, appealed to my\\n      knowledge for a reason as to why she remained childless. The lady was\\n      carrying an excess of flesh, being under the medium height, and weighing\\n      186 pounds, but appeared to be in good health; family and previous history\\n      all that could be desired. Examination showed none of the common causes of\\n      sterility; neither, so far as I could ascertain, was the husband\\n      responsible for this unproductive condition of affairs. Some previous\\n      experiences of my own, with the added testimony of other and able men, was\\n      my reason for charging this condition of things to the excess of flesh,\\n      this, by the husband, being laughingly charged to excess of laziness.\\n      \\n We all, undoubtedly, are familiar with\\n      that peculiar disease of the blood-corpuscles which, whilst producing\\n      flesh, relaxes at the same time the muscular force; acting also, I\\n      believe, upon the muscular fibres of the uterus and upon the ovaries,\\n      inducing not only serious menstrual disorders but sterility. McKee,\\n      Philbert, and others give several instances of sterility chargeable to\\n      obesity, the women in question having been married several years without\\n      bearing children, and all became mothers after losing a portion of their\\n      flesh. If any other argument were needed in support of this theory we\\n      might turn to the quadrupeds, where we find the poorest breeders among the\\n      fleshiest animals. Fournel has a very able treatise on \"The Effects\\n      of Obesity on the Menstrual Functions and Parturition.\" Without\\n      having had any actual case of this description to deal with, he inclines\\n      very strongly towards the belief that obesity favors sterility. In the\\n      treatment of the case before mentioned, the patient was subjected to a\\n      daily massage of the entire body, with a special pelvic massage three\\n      times a week. This, in the main, consists in elevating the uterus as high\\n      as possible with the finger in the vagina, ending with a quick and decided\\n      vibratory motion. The diet received particular attention, as at this time\\n      there was a slight gastric ailment. The indicated remedy, Thuja, was given\\n      in the minimum dose. At the end of three months almost thirty pounds of\\n      flesh was gone, a considerable reduction. As an experiment, I recommended\\n      coitus in the knee-elbow position, advising that the lady remain quiet as\\n      long as possible after coition, with thighs well flexed. She became\\n      enciente, but miscarried at eight weeks. There was, comparatively\\n      speaking, but little pain and not much subsequent haemorrhage. She made a\\n      rapid recovery. Since then a living child has been born to them.\\n      \\n I believe I am safe in saying that this\\n      result would hardly have obtained were it not for the prophylactic\\n      measures adopted.\\n      \\n At the end of the first two months the\\n      patient was attacked with haemorrhage. A similar occurrence took place at\\n      irregular intervals during the following five months, the quantity of\\n      blood lost being much greater than that at the normal menstrual period.\\n      \\n For the greater part of the last five\\n      months she kept her bed, at the end of which time the tendency of the\\n      uterus to empty itself could be resisted no longer. A seven months\\' child\\n      was born, and is to-day doing well.\\n      \\n Pseudocyesis cerebral pregnancy,\\n      phantom pregnancy (whatever name we may call it by) is a disease which\\n      must come under the head of those \"complicating pregnancy.\" Mrs.\\n      M., a lady, married two or three years, aet. 29. Previous history good,\\n      always enjoying perfect health. When I first saw the lady in question she\\n      was a perfect picture of health, and, according to appearance and her own\\n      statements, about seven months pregnant. I made no examination. This\\n      appeared to be a thoroughly intelligent woman, and, according to her own\\n      statement, there was cessation of the menses. There certainly was an\\n      enlargement of the abdomen and breasts, a milky secretion, and the lady\\n      was sure that she felt foetal movement. On February 28th of the present\\n      year I was called to attend her in labor. Examination showed that no\\n      pregnancy existed. So far as I could ascertain there was no assignable\\n      origin for this condition other than nervous influences, the phenomena\\n      being purely muscular distension of the abdomen.\\n      \\n Mayham reports a case of a woman 73\\n      years old, claiming to be pregnant; he also claims that subsequently she\\n      was delivered of a child; this is an Allopathic report, however, of which\\n      we will take a Homoeopathic dose. Haultain reports three cases of cerebral\\n      pregnancy. In the first, he says no cause whatever was to be found; in the\\n      second, there was a small fibroid growth in the anterior uterine wall.\\n      Hauck reports a case where the vomiting, peristalsis, and flatus, caused\\n      by alcoholism were supposed to be caused by the pregnant state. Such cases\\n      are uncommon, but they emphasize the importance of making a thorough\\n      examination, in all cases where positive information is desired of the\\n      existence or non-existence of pregnancy.\\n      \\n Hyperemesis Gravidarum.-An animated\\n      discussion, held recently between two celebrated Allopaths of Stuttgart\\n      and Leipsic, has served to awaken a renewed interest in this subject,\\n      without in the least adding anything new to our stock of knowledge\\n      regarding its aetiology. Notwithstanding the frequency of the vomiting of\\n      pregnancy, its very distressing character in many instances, and its\\n      imminent, its very distressing character in many instances, and its\\n      imminent danger, we find but very few contributions of any value, to\\n      either the aetiology of the disorder or its therapeutics. I do not expect\\n      to add anything specially new myself, but it does seem to me that our\\n      knowledge of the vomiting of pregnancy, is to say the least, in a most\\n      contradictory state. Some physicians look upon it as a trifling matter,\\n      others as a thing to be endured, and some-these are in the right too-view\\n      even the mildest cases with gravity. Even in the mildest cases of morning\\n      sickness there is a constant drain upon the nervous system, putting the\\n      sufferer into a condition, in which she is very much less able to endure\\n      parturition than she would otherwise have been.\\n      \\n Dr. Harrison Mettler says: \"After\\n      careful inquiry I find that women who suffer from much morning sickness\\n      have as a rule, tedious or otherwise troublesome labors. I have observed\\n      in multiparae that at one time they will have much nausea and vomiting\\n      followed by a difficult labor, while at another time they will be quite\\n      free from the vomiting, and will pass through the succeeding labor with\\n      comparative ease.\" I must say my observations make me agree with Dr.\\n      Mettler entirely; when one thinks how rapidly the mildest of cases assume\\n      pernicious forms, indifference is certainly no longer to be excused. There\\n      is a voluminous literature upon this subject, and many and varied are the\\n      aetiological reasons given for this very variable affection, a large\\n      majority of writers coinciding in the opinion that \"many causes\\n      operate together,\" to produce what we are pleased to designate the\\n      \"vomiting of pregnancy.\" I believe myself that in a large\\n      percentage of cases, this pernicious vomiting is simply the result of a\\n      reflex neurosis. Undoubtedly uterine displacements frequently cause\\n      vomiting; but when this is so, and the displaced organ is raised by\\n      packing the vagina with aseptic wool, the vomiting ceases.\\n      \\n Lillie reports a number of cases, where\\n      obstinate vomiting was caused by a retroflexed uterus, and restoration of\\n      the organ caused a cessation of the disorder. Bezugloff having a\\n      persistent case of morning sickness, introduced a bougie it no the uterus,\\n      the intention being to produce abortion; the immediate result was a\\n      stoppage of the vomiting, and the pregnancy went on to full term.\\n      \\n In the case just cited, I must say that\\n      I believe it was the fright, caused by the thought of abortion being\\n      performed, more than the effects of introducing the bougie, which operated\\n      so successfully; I say now, as I said before, I believe that the\\n      pre-eminent cause of this kind of sickness must be looked for i the\\n      nervous system. Flint speaks of this form of sickness as being decidedly\\n      neurotic in its origin, and cites a number of cases of a chronic variety\\n      of dyspepsia frequently occurring in young girls. I had one such case come\\n      under my personal care. There was a persistent morning sickness, with this\\n      young lady, and a disagreeable nausea whenever food was taken; this\\n      patient was at some distance from her home, in a boarding school, and she\\n      will probably never know that the lady principal entertained very grave\\n      thoughts at one time in regard to her virtue. It certainly was very\\n      difficult to differentiate between this and the vomiting of pregnancy; it\\n      was, however, simply due to a vitiated nervous system. My theory is\\n      supported by Alt, who records a number of such cases; I cite one only, the\\n      case being that of a highly hysterical woman, six months pregnant,\\n      suffering from the gravest vomiting, and anxious that miscarriage be\\n      induced. She was making preparation for entering the hospital for this\\n      purpose, when one of her children was seized with pneumonia. The anxiety\\n      felt over the child, forced all thought of self from the mother\\'s mind;\\n      from that moment the vomiting ceased and she remained well until the\\n      termination of pregnancy.-Minchener Medicinische Wochenschrift.\\n      \\n Whilst saying that I believe this\\n      disease to be in the majority of cases of purely nervous origin, I would\\n      not imply thereby that it is not to be feared, far from it; if neglected,\\n      we know how likely it is to pass quickly beyond treatment and our patient\\n      succumb from sheer exhaustion.\\n      \\n In the treatment cited such as\\n      insertion of bougies, dilation of the os, pelvic massage, etc., I believe\\n      it is merely the \"doing something,\" no matter much what it is,\\n      so long as you have gained the confidence of your patient, that does good.\\n      We have seen how suddenly Hyperemesis will cease if the patient be\\n      alarmed; it may be, has often been, and will to again, cured by a process\\n      skin to suggestion. Kattenback had a case where the patient, a primipara,\\n      was seized with an incorrigible vomiting. It was suggested to her that her\\n      stomach contained some lumps of unwholesome material and their removal\\n      would cure her. Some milk was given her, and the stomach ceremoniously\\n      washed out. its contents bore no indications of either over-acidity or\\n      abnormal ferment She was informed that she was all right and the vomiting\\n      would not return; neither did if, and she was safely delivered at term.\\n      \\n There is a familiar and now well-know\\n      phenomena, by which these neurotics can be influenced; I speak of\\n      hypnotism; it is due to purely subjective conditions.\\n      \\n There is an identity of the hypnotic\\n      susceptibility with the condition of hysteria, and it is along these lines\\n      that we can work. Just as many times as I have tried this method of\\n      treatment, for these cases of excessive vomiting, just so many times has\\n      it given me gratifying results.\\n      \\n The patient can be to sleep by\\n      bi-ocular pressure, and the idea of cure suggested; the operation may have\\n      to be repeated several times, at intervals of a day or so, but you will be\\n      rewarded by the cessation of the vomiting, often with but one suggestion.\\n      Where the patient is not easily controlled by means of the bi-ocular\\n      pressure, Luy\\'s revolving mirror is a never failing resource.'\n",
      " 'Tresorie - PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS [Presidential Address]\\n\\n THE ROLE OF HOMOEOPATHY IN THE SECOND\\n      \\n By ALVA BENJAMIN, M.B.CH.B., F.F.HOM.\\n      \\n Such a system of medicine must\\n      recognize that it is as much an art as a science, and that healing is a\\n      relationship between two living personalities. It must recognize too, that\\n      the sick individual has to take an active part in his treatment and not be\\n      merely the passive recipient of this or that treatment. For just as it is\\n      rightly said that man does not live by alone, so should it be emphasized\\n      that man cannot be cured by medicine alone. He must see to it himself that\\n      he lives as far as possible a physically and psychically healthy life.\\n      Indeed, each individual has a power within himself to help in his own\\n      cure.\\n      \\n Do the official schools of medicine\\n      teach such an art today? I am afraid not: they are so intent on seeking\\n      the specific treatment for this or that named disease or the antibiotic\\n      that will most effectively put out of action the organism regarded as the\\n      cause of the disease, that they are losing sight of the individual\\n      himself.\\n      \\n But Homoeopathy in its persistent\\n      search for the reactions of the individual to his environment in the\\n      broadest sense, no matter of what the patient is complaining surely\\n      fulfills these requirements, especially when it is recognized that the\\n      homoeopathic potencies do not anything to the patient as do the drugs of\\n      the dominant school, but rather stimulate the patients own recuperative\\n      powers to overcome the infection or re - establish the normal metabolism\\n      which has become deranged by the illness.\\n      \\n When you consider how the homoeopathic\\n      physician diagnoses the individuality of his patient over and above the\\n      name of the disease from which he is suffering, and uses for the purpose\\n      of his prescription rather than the name of the disease this personal\\n      diagnosis of the patients mental and emotional reactions, his responses to\\n      changes in weather conditions, the alternations in his environment which\\n      influence his symptoms, etc., one realize how very individualistic is the\\n      Homoeopathic prescription fitted to that particular patient.\\n      \\n The homoeopathic physician does not\\n      seek for a remedy specific to any named disease and which he can thus\\n      apply almost automatically once he has made his organic diagnosis, which\\n      in quite an appreciable number of instances may ultimately be found to be\\n      wrong and so the treatment based upon it must therefore have been wrong.\\n      He does not, as is so often done, merely suppress the most outstanding\\n      symptom by an appropriate drug; for example giving an anodyne to mask the\\n      pain or removing the skin eruption by some strong local application, in\\n      other words putting the dust under the mat and pretending the room is\\n      clean.\\n      \\n Strangely enough the homoeopathic\\n      physician is often accused by his allopathic critic in his ignorance of\\n      Homoeopathy, of merely treating symptoms, whereas it is the critic himself\\n      who practices this superficial medicine. The homoeopathic physician, on\\n      the other hand, treats his patient as a whole through his symptoms and\\n      their modifications through changes in the environment, which is quite a\\n      different matter.\\n      \\n Homoeopathic therapy, unlike methods of\\n      treatment, is based on a natural law \"Similia Similibus\\n      Curentur\" \"Likes may be cured by likes\" which has been\\n      proved time and time again by experiment and which anyone with the will to\\n      do may prove for himself. It is not subject to constant change brought\\n      about by this or that latest discovery, and which itself will soon have to\\n      give way to the still later idea.\\n      \\n Having now introduced to you our actor,\\n      what of the scene in which he is to play his role?\\n      \\n This is the nineteen hundred and fifty\\n      - fourth year of the Christian era and the second year of the reign of our\\n      much loved and admired young Queen Elizabeth II, who will remember while\\n      in south Africa on her twenty - first birthday, before she had any idea\\n      that she would so soon be called to such an exalted position as she holds\\n      today, broadcast to the commonwealth and Empire her resolve to dedicate\\n      her life to the service of this grand community which dedication she\\n      recently repeated at her Coronation.\\n      \\n Here in Great Britain we have a more or\\n      less complete welfare state, with which idea some of us may very strongly\\n      disagree, whilst others believe such a development is the result of a\\n      natural very desirable social evolution.\\n      \\n As one necessary ingredient of this\\n      welfare state came, in 1948, the initiation of the National Health\\n      Service, through which the great majority of the population receives its\\n      medical attention, although it is rightly available to all.\\n      \\n When we come to consider the role that\\n      homoeo - therapeutics should play in this scheme, I would suggest that we\\n      should regard the problem from the purely medical aspect, forgetting any\\n      political party allegiances or sympathies we may have; or if we cannot\\n      forget them we should remember that the organization of the National\\n      Insurance Scheme of which the National Health Service is but a part, was\\n      first blue printed by the well - known Liberal supporter, Lord Beveridge,\\n      and the Health Service plans developed by the Coalition Government of all\\n      three major political parties.\\n      \\n We are living at present in an age\\n      which may very justifiably be regarded as a violent age in which have been\\n      developed so many appalling instruments of destruction, the use of some of\\n      which we are quite complacently accepting and from the use of others we\\n      are refraining, not because we consider them immoral, but simply through\\n      the fear of the wholesale destruction which would be caused by their use.\\n      We are seeing X-rays used in very high voltages in the treatment of\\n      cancer, we are being constantly remained of the use of dangerous drugs in\\n      medicine, without justification, in my opinion, bearing in mind the\\n      doubtful and evanescent ameliorations they produce and the violent\\n      surgical treatment of mental patients.\\n      \\n One further violence we should not\\n      forget is the way some of our foods are devitalized by the extraction of\\n      this or that portion of the natural product for purposes quite foreign to\\n      the well - being of the people who are to feed on them; or they are\\n      contaminated by the addition of this or that dangerous chemical, either\\n      during the growing of the plant, in the form of sprays, or as so called\\n      improvers in, for instance, the manufacture of white bread. It is very\\n      significant in this regard that quite a lot of attention is paid to the\\n      protection of the man who sprays the crops, but the right of the consumer\\n      to have uncontaminated food is slurred over by the unjustifiable statement\\n      that the amount of these chemicals so consumed is so small that it cannot\\n      have any bad effect on the consumer. We who practice Homoeopathy know how\\n      unwarranted is such a statement.\\n      \\n Can we homoeopathic physicians and\\n      patient hope to be able to do anything to make the still small voice of\\n      Homoeopathy heard in all this tumult, so that we may return to a saner and\\n      more healthful way of life and help our young Queen in her lifes work for\\n      the communitys sake?\\n      \\n Can we expect any help from the leaders\\n      of the medical profession? I am afraid not, because although I believe it\\n      accurate to state that there is a very slowly growing interest in, and\\n      tolerance of our work by individual doctors, the medical authorities are\\n      still, in their prejudice, strongly opposed to us. The London University\\n      still refuses to recognize our Hospital as a post - graduate teaching\\n      Hospital: the British Medical Association prohibits the formation of a\\n      homoeopathic section of its organization, and the Royal College of\\n      Physicians still refuses its membership to any one known as a homoeopathic\\n      physician. Yet in spite of this unfavourable environment, I firmly believe\\n      that there is a future for our method of therapeutics: but it will have to\\n      be pursued with courage, determination, foresight and energy. Surely if we\\n      believe as I do, that we are the guardians of a system of treatment\\n      destined to make our people healthier and therefore more efficient and\\n      happier, we would be failing in our duty to our country if we did not take\\n      every means in our power to acquaint the community at large with the\\n      advantages of this system and the dangers of ignoring it. This is a duty,\\n      not only of the profession, but also of the laity interested in\\n      Homoeopathy and who have experienced its benefits.\\n      \\n Every physician has two professional\\n      obligation to the community, that of preserving its health and that of\\n      endeavouring to restore it to being when it has fallen by the way.\\n      \\n The homoeopathic physician, thorough\\n      his knowledge acquired through the provings of drugs, even in\\n      infinitesimal doses, has, I believe, a very special responsibility as\\n      regards the prophylaxis of disease. It seems to me that a great deal of\\n      chronic ill health may quite conceivably be due to the manipulations of\\n      our foods and to the artificial manuring of the ground in which many of\\n      them are grown. Experiments have been carried our proving that plants\\n      grown in soil enriched by natural manuring, are much less prone to\\n      diseases than those grown with the help of artificial chemical manures. It\\n      seems a fairly justified conclusion that vegetables grown under these\\n      artificial conditions may quite well be deficient in something necessary\\n      for our perfect health. It is therefore incumbent upon the physician to\\n      advocate whenever possible the ingestion of healthily grown foods in the\\n      widest sense of that term.\\n      \\n The same duty applies when we consider\\n      the great amount of drugging in which the community at large indulges by\\n      its excessive smoking, particularly when aggravated by the practice of\\n      inhaling, and by the continued and prolonged use of drugs for this or that\\n      symptom, too often, unfortunately, though not always, on the prescription\\n      of their medical advisors.\\n      \\n There is a great lack throughout the\\n      community of any real enthusiasm for perfect health: we are only too prone\\n      to be content to follow like sheep, the unintelligent and harmful\\n      practices of the majority of our fellows.\\n      \\n Similarly in the curative realm, we\\n      homoeopathic physicians have special obligations.\\n      \\n When considering our position vis-a-vis\\n      the rest of the profession, we must never lose sight of the fact that our\\n      approach to the sick individual is a much broader and more comprehensive\\n      one than that of the dominant school. This latter prides itself on its\\n      scientific approach to its problems. One must, however, always be on ones\\n      guard against being hypnotized by that word scientific. The scientific\\n      aspect of any phenomenon or problem dealing with humanity is only one\\n      limited aspect of that problem. To get a complete picture one must\\n      consider other aspect, such as the aesthetic, emotional, maybe religious,\\n      and above all, perhaps one might say embracing all, the philosophical\\n      approach. This complex approach to his patients problem is the one that\\n      the homoeopathic physician always strives to adopt, and so never loses\\n      sight of the ego of the patient, while at the same time not forgetting his\\n      physical make - up.\\n      \\n Because this approach of ours to our\\n      patients is a much broader and more comprehensive one than the much\\n      vaunted scientific aspect, which the dominant school has come to regard as\\n      the Ultima Thule of medicine, I deplore the oft - repeated request of some\\n      of my colleagues that we should forsake our philosophy and make our work\\n      as scientific as theirs. I do not mean to imply by this that we should\\n      neglect the scientific angle of our patients illness but we should always\\n      remember that is only one facet of our problem. That is why we take such\\n      pains to diagnose our patients personality with his reaction to his\\n      environment in addition to the physical diagnosis of the case in order to\\n      arrive at our prescription for his malady. In other words, we should\\n      endeavour to lead our dominant school colleagues to our way of thinking,\\n      rather than that we should adopt theirs.\\n      \\n At the same time must always remember\\n      that if our philosophy should seem at any time to contradict so - called\\n      scientific laws, we must re - examine our philosophy, and if necessary\\n      modify it, while at the same time remembering that many times in the past\\n      what have been regarded as laws have ultimately been proved not to be so.\\n      Thus it is evident that we must never relax our self - examination.\\n      \\n What shall be the role of the\\n      homoeopathic laity?\\n      \\n The first thing for them to remember is\\n      that we are living in a democratic country whose government is dependent\\n      on the goodwill of the governed, and that, if a sufficient number of\\n      voters desire a certain line of action, that line will be adopted by the\\n      government.\\n      \\n The second thought is that there are\\n      not nearly sufficient doctors practising Homoeopathy in Great Britain to\\n      satisfy the present demand, let alone any further increased demand in the\\n      future, for this line of treatment.\\n      \\n Does not this seem strange, having\\n      regard to the great advantage to humanity that Homoeopathy provides? Not\\n      if one looks below the surface and so finds the reason for this shortage.\\n      \\n Surely the most potent reason is that\\n      Homoeopathy is not taught in the official Medical Schools, either as a pre\\n      - or post - graduate study. The London University when asked to recognize\\n      the Royal London Homoeopathic Hospital as a post - graduate Medical\\n      School, refused on the plea that as Homoeopathy was not taught in the\\n      undergraduate Medical Schools, it could not find a place for it in its\\n      post - graduate curriculum.\\n      \\n It is, of course, nonsense to suggest\\n      that a graduate should pursue his studies only in those subject of which\\n      he had already obtained some knowledge in his undergraduate days and\\n      should not wish to obtain information on any new or extra subject.\\n      \\n The University Medical Shools are\\n      enabled to a great extent through Government grants. We must therefore\\n      find some way of influencing whatever Government be in power to bring\\n      pressure to bear upon the London University to remove this obstacle to the\\n      better health of the community at large. I am quite satisfied that once\\n      this academic recognition is obtained we shave many more post - graduate\\n      students of Homoeopathy.\\n      \\n I believe than in a democratic\\n      community, having a universal State Medical Service, it is the bounden\\n      duty of the Government to remove all obstacles to the peoples obtaining\\n      that form of medical treatment in which they have confidence. So long as\\n      Homoeopathy is denied its legitimate status, so long must be Government be\\n      deemed to b failing in its duty to the country.\\n      \\n If, however, we are to achieve this\\n      desirable object of full recognition, we must all, professional and laity,\\n      be fired with enthusiasm, not only for the abstract cause of Homoeopathy,\\n      but for being partners with our young Queen in delicating our lives to the\\n      community.\\n      \\n When we do this we shall help to make\\n      this second Elizabethan era one to be remembered throughout the ages to\\n      come as surpassing the first Elizabethan era in that it gained not so much\\n      the economic and political leadership of the world - though that is not to\\n      be despised - but showed the way to the most healthful and spiritual way\\n      of life that all the world look notice and followed suit.\\n      \\n To sum up, the Role of Homoeopathy, as\\n      I see it, is to humanize the practice of medicine. By that I mean it must\\n      bring the practice of medicine into line with a reasoned philosophy of\\n      life, restore to it its artistry and rid it of all unnecessary hazards. It\\n      is to do this, not from any abstract academic sense of superiority, but in\\n      order the years to come are not those of merely another reign, but to\\n      ensure a veritable Renaissance, starting with the second Elizabethan era\\n      in which Great Britain will take its rightful place in the comity of\\n      nations as the pathfinder to a way of life for which posterity will be\\n      able to say \"Thank God for Queen Elizabeth the Second and her\\n      peoples.'\n",
      " 'Tresorie - Roentgenometric Pelvimetry [Roentgenometric Pelvimetry]\\n CHARLES W.PERKINS, M.D.\\n      \\n Norwalk, Conn\\n      \\n FOR some time the x-ray has been used\\n      to advantage in diagnosis of multiple pregnancy, position of fetus and\\n      fetal abnormalities. However, it has been only the past four or five years\\n      that any definite information has been obtained by roentgenographic\\n      methods of diagnoses in pelvimetry.\\n      \\n At the present time we are convinced\\n      that only by means of roentgenographs can be true proportions of the\\n      superior strait be determined, and that the ordinary external methods of\\n      Pelvimetry are not only occasionally misleading but proportionately\\n      inaccurate.\\n      \\n The present communication deals with\\n      the method of Herbert Thomas of Yale University. This method was developed\\n      in cooperation with the late Dr. W.A. Lafield, who was Professor of\\n      Roentgenology at the Yale Medical School.\\n      \\n Some of the reasons why roentgen\\n      pelvimetry has not been more universally adopted are probably due to the\\n      following factors.\\n      \\n (1) The majority of women will be\\n      delivered normally, whether or not pelvic measurements are made.\\n      \\n (2) The medical profession does not\\n      readily accept a new method after an established satisfactory routine has\\n      been in use.\\n      \\n (3) A new method of diagnosis incurs\\n      added expense.\\n      \\n (4) The present methods, although\\n      entirely speculative, are satisfactory in most cases.\\n      \\n (5) Roentgen pelvimetry cannot be\\n      performed by the obstetrician himself but requires the aid of a\\n      roentgenologist.\\n      \\n (6) The value of roentgenometric\\n      diagnosis is recent in origin and as yet not universally accepted.\\n      \\n If the knowledge of the size and shape\\n      of the pelvis is necessary to the practice of obstetrics, roentgen\\n      pelvimetry is a sound procedure, particularly in pre-emptors patients, and\\n      should and should be considered as an indispensable aid in these cases.\\n      \\n The method of Herbert Thoms as\\n      developed at Yale Medical School is not the only method. However, it can\\n      be classified as simple, accurate and rapid; being adaptable for use by\\n      other than experts in x-ray and obstetric diagnosis. As a technical\\n      procedure a well trained hospital technician can master its technic alter\\n      sufficient instruction.\\n      \\n Studies of recent years reveal the fact\\n      that external Pelvimetry fails to give uniform and accurate information in\\n      regard to the shape and size of the superior strait. This is often true of\\n      thin undersized individuals. In many patients of this type external\\n      measurements may suggest a contracted pelvis while the x-ray will show a\\n      relatively large pelvis with a subsequent natural labor and normal-sized\\n      child. On the other hand a stocky short person with similar external\\n      measurements will disclose a contracted pelvis which is an obstetric\\n      problem. Because of the apparent relationship between shortening of the\\n      transverse diameter and a secondary persistent occipito-posterior\\n      presentation, accurate information regarding this diameter is of clinical\\n      significance.\\n      \\n The observations of Thomas were made on\\n      twenty consecutive patients whose pelvis showed a relative or real\\n      shortening of the transverse diameter of the superior strait. In every\\n      instance a primary or secondary occipito posterior position was found\\n      after the patient was in labor. (Herbert Thoms, Surgery, Gynecology and\\n      Obstetrics, January, 1933). It therefore has been proved that an actual or\\n      relative shortening of a transverse diameter of the superior strait\\n      results in a limitation of space that is greater in the anterior than in\\n      the posterior half of the superior strait. Under these circumstances, when\\n      the head descends early in labor, the occiput is forced to rotate\\n      posteriorly.\\n      \\n The x-ray offers additional information\\n      in determining the size of the fetal head. It has been noted in x-ray\\n      examination of the unengaged fetal head that it lay with the transverse\\n      diameter of the superior strait, the occiput being either to the right or\\n      left; therefore, if roentgenogram of the patient is taken in the supine\\n      position with the fetus in the uterus, it will cast a shadow which is an\\n      enlarged profile of the head. The measurements of the occipital frontal\\n      diameter of the head can then be made. On numerous occasions this method\\n      of cephalometry, determining the diameter of the unmoulded head before and\\n      after cesarean section, has yielded accurate results. (Thomas, A.M.A.,\\n      February 24, 1934).\\n      \\n As experience increases in roentgen\\n      pelvimetry, the so-called labor test will be employed less. This, however,\\n      does not mean that the physician should not under estimate the importance\\n      of uterine contraction and the ability of the fetal head to mold. It has\\n      always followed that when something could be proved desirable in medicine\\n      for the better protection of the patient, such an advance would be\\n      demanded and eventually become routine. We may concede, therefore, that\\n      roentgen pelvimetry has a distinct place in the examination of every\\n      primiparous woman. In many instances, according to Thomas and others,\\n      external; measurements were normal but the x-ray examination revealed a\\n      contracted pelvis. On the other had, in certain patients whose external\\n      measurements suggested a cesarean section roentgen pelvimetry proved\\n      otherwise and they were subsequently delivered in a normal manner.\\n      \\n CENTIMETER GRID METHOD.\\n      \\n The procedure in this method may be\\n      summarized by stating the following:.\\n      \\n (1) The patient is placed on the\\n      roentgenographic table in the semi- recumbent position.\\n      \\n (2) The level of the superior strait\\n      above the sensitized film is established.\\n      \\n (3) The tube target is centered about\\n      five centimeters posterior to the symphysis, at thirty-two inches from the\\n      sensitized film, The exposure is made.\\n      \\n (4) The patient is removed from the\\n      table, the tube target and sensitized film remaining in situ.\\n      \\n (5) A lead plate, or centimeter grid,\\n      with perforations exactly one centimeter apart, is introduced into the\\n      same plane as that previously occupied by the superior strait and a second\\n      (flash) exposure is made on the same sensitized film as was used used in\\n      the previous exposure.\\n      \\n (6) Development of the film shows the\\n      outline of the superior strait and the shadows of the perforations, the\\n      assistance between which represents centimeters in the plane of the\\n      superior strait. The anteroposterior and transverse diameters of the\\n      superior strait in its use proportions may be drawn on centimeter-square\\n      paper by following the course of the shadow of the superior strait and\\n      transcribing it.\\n      \\n As this time I wish to express my\\n      thanks to Dr. Thoms for his personal advice and instruction which helped\\n      me to master the technic of his method.'\n",
      " 'Tresorie - NOTATU DIGNUM [Test Of A Homoeopath]\\n\\n Complaints are not unfrequently made\\n      that the homoeopathic materia medica is too vast for practical utility;\\n      that the schematised list of symptoms are unprofitable, if not impossible\\n      reading.

      " 'Tresorie - THE EFFICACY OF THE VIBROMETER IN APPLYING VIBRATORY MASSAGE\\nIN AURAL DISEASES [Efficacy Of Vibrometer In Applying Vibratory Message In Aural\\nDisease]\\n\\n SINCE presenting my paper before the\\n      American Institute, in June of last year on \"Vibratory Motion as a\\n      Method of Massage in Aural Diseases,\" I have been using an instrument\\n      specially devised for that purpose called the \"vibrometer.\" This\\n      instrument is in shape like a banjo, and has four strings stretched across\\n      its length resting on a bridge, which sets upon a diaphragm. On each side,\\n      elevated above the diaphragm and supported by posts, are two horizontal\\n      bars, which support the mechanical appliances used for producing the\\n      various vibratory motions. This consists in what is called a yoke, in\\n      which revolves a shaft connected with the electro-motor by pulley-wheels\\n      and a belt. Behind the diaphragm is a shallow air-tight compartment,\\n      leading from which are rubber tubes that are inserted in the external\\n      auditory canal during treatment, consequently any vibratory motion of the\\n      diaphragm, which must necessarily be an inward and a corresponding outward\\n      movement, would be exactly reproduced upon the membrana tympani, as the\\n      confined air, not being able to escape, will undergo an alternate\\n      condensation and rarefication in the external auditory canal.\\n      \\n Every vibratory movement of the strings\\n      of the instrument is communicated to the diaphragm by means of the bridge\\n      upon which it rests. These strings by varying their tension and length can\\n      be regulated to give a high or low rate of vibration as desired, for\\n      instance, the heaviest string left at its original length adjusted to a\\n      slight tension may make about fifty vibratory motions to the second, while\\n      the highest string on the instrument adjusted to a high tension and\\n      clamped down to one-fourth its original length would probably make three\\n      thousand vibratory motions to the second.\\n      \\n In the centre of the diaphragm is an\\n      attachment which works on a lever, and when hit by the cam on the\\n      revolving shaft lifts the diaphragm to a considerable extent, causing a\\n      powerful effect on the membrana tympani. This attachment can be adjusted\\n      at four different leverages, which causes a modification or increase of\\n      its intensity and can be regulated at from one to twenty-five vibratory\\n      movements to the second. This is only used in very bad cases and for not\\n      more than five minutes continuously.\\n      \\n The instrument which I have been\\n      describing in an improvement on the first manufactured, and as far as I\\n      know, is the only one which offers the same facilities for applying this\\n      method of massage. The class of patients in my experience who are\\n      generally benefited from the first, are those in which the mucous membrane\\n      lining the tympanic cavity and Eustachian tubes is in a hypertrophic\\n      condition. The membrana tympani are depressed, opaque, and thickened. They\\n      usually complain of a stiffed sensation in the ears, with a great deal of\\n      tinnitus aurium, and that their hearing is worse during a cold. In cases\\n      where the mucous membranes are atrophied with a large external auditory\\n      canal perfectly dry and Eustachian tubes patulous, and generally very\\n      little tinnitus, this or no other treatment has done very much good in the\\n      majority of cases, and in looking ever my records I find that only about\\n      five per cent. have been relieved, while in the before-mentioned cases the\\n      good results reach at least seventy-five per cent. In treating persons, I\\n      always select the rate of vibration which corresponds in pitch, if\\n      possible, to that caused by the diseased condition of the ears. If there\\n      is no tinnitus to guide me, I find whether the patient can hear a high or\\n      low sound better; if it is a low sound, a high rate of vibration is used\\n      in treatment, and vice versa, A point which I would like to explain here\\n      is this: It is not necessary that the sound from the instrument should be\\n      of the same quality of the tinnitus experienced by the patient, but merely\\n      the same pitch. for instance, if a banjo, where one of the strings was\\n      adjusted when sounded to produce a certain note, and a musical instrument\\n      of any other kind, whose quality of tone was entirely different, was made\\n      to sound the same note in a room, the string on the banjo would vibrate in\\n      sympathy, which has been proven by experiment, any other note, no matter\\n      how loud, would have no effect. Another point is in the way the strings of\\n      the vibrometer are set in motion. On the revolving shaft is a wheel\\n      projecting from which are metallic picks which hit the string it is\\n      adjusted over. It does not make any difference in the number of vibratory\\n      motions per second, whether the string is hit fast or slow, but at the\\n      time the string is first hit the intensity is greater than it is just\\n      before being hit again, and as the motion of the wheel is perfectly\\n      rhythmic, revolving so many times to the second, it has just as good an\\n      effect as if the intensity during the fraction of a second did not vary at\\n      all. The idea of using vibratory motion, as I have said before, originated\\n      within my mind some years ago, and later put into practical operation, and\\n      as far as I know, was the first to lay before the profession in a\\n      scientific manner, this method of massage.\\n      \\n I have found that when two of the\\n      strings upon the vibrometer were regulated in such a way that when both\\n      were set in vibration at the same time, producing the sensation of a\\n      harmonious sound, the effect in some cases on the tinnitus was especially\\n      beneficial, relieving, where the various kinds of vibrations produced by a\\n      single string failed. Sub-acute cases of deafness, accompanied by tinnitus\\n      aurium, are quickly relieved, as the following case will illustrate:.\\n      \\n Mrs. M. Young, married lady, aet. 26,\\n      called at my office, April 1, 1893, complaining of partial deafness and\\n      tinnitus aurium. She had a stuffed sensation, or as if cotton had been\\n      packed in the external auditory canal. She says the tinnitus was so\\n      annoying as to prevent sleep. On examination, found considerable\\n      retraction of the membrana tympani, and hearing for the watch, on the\\n      right side five inches, on the left, seven inches. The Eustachian tube\\n      were partially closed, which made inflation somewhat difficult, giving\\n      slight relief. I used several of the vibrations on the different strings\\n      without immediate benefit.\\n      \\n April 4th.-She came again, and reported\\n      that no improvement had taken place. I again inflated her ears, after\\n      which she sat down to the vibrometer. The central attachment was used with\\n      considerable force continuously for four minutes, after which she declared\\n      that the tinnitus had entirely ceased in the right ear, and greatly\\n      modified in the left; the hearing for the watch had increased for both\\n      ears to fourteen inches, and the stuffed sensation had almost entirely\\n      disappeared. On inspection of the membrana tympani, found them\\n      comparatively very slightly retracted. On April 8th, found improvement had\\n      continued, when the same treatment was used for three minutes; after which\\n      she declared herself completely relieved of the tinnitus and stuffed\\n      sensation, with hearing powerfully restored. Saw her again on April 13th,\\n      when she declared the good results from last treatment to have still\\n      continued.\\n      \\n I find that in the majority of cases,\\n      when the strings of the instrument are used it is only necessary to strike\\n      them lightly with the friction wheel. In vibrating the heavy string, I\\n      generally set the bridge back behind the central attachment, and adjusting\\n      the motor in such way that the belt is at a considerable tension, so that\\n      the pulley-wheel revolves slowly. I also generally use this adjustment\\n      when setting in motion two strings at one time. The principle of this\\n      method of treatment embraces two essential features which to my mind makes\\n      this system of massage the only scientific one applicable to the membrana\\n      tympani and its associate sound-conducting parts. Message is the\\n      application of motion to disease, and its scientific administration\\n      consists of its application in a systematic manner. In applying massage in\\n      aural diseases, it is necessary to produce a to-and-fro movement of the\\n      membrana tympani, and, if possible, by a force which is harmless and at\\n      the same time effective. The vibrometer fulfils these conditions. Any of\\n      the strings on the instrument that may be set in motion by the\\n      friction-wheel, will produce a certain number of vibratory movements to\\n      the second of time, and the movements of the central attachment are also\\n      measured. What could be more systematic than this? The motions of the\\n      membrana tympani were intended by nature to its vibratory, and as the\\n      vibrometer generates measured motion, and these motions are vibratory,\\n      theoretically we have a scientific and effective method of massage in\\n      aural diseases; and, as demonstrated practically by the use of the\\n      vibrometer, we have in fact a great scientific advance over all previous\\n      methods. Since the introduction of this treatment in aural diseases, it\\n      makes possible a more or less benefit in cases of deafness heretofore\\n      considered hopeless, and has opened up the field for the treatment of\\n      aural diseases to such an extent that the number of deaf patients seeking\\n      relief at the aurist\\'s hands will at least double itself.\\n      \\n DISCUSSION.\\n      \\n H.C. HOUGHTON, M.D.: Dr. Garey\\'s\\n      admirable paper gives us the description of the vibrometer, an instrument\\n      devised under his personal direction and inspection, for the purpose of\\n      applying massage to the ear. It is the only instrument of the kind on the\\n      market, so far as I am aware, and after a somewhat prolonged use of it, I\\n      am prepared to recommend the latest production of the vibrometer company.\\n      \\n This instrument is a decided\\n      improvement over the instrument first sent out, and is capable of\\n      producing a most profound effect upon the drum-head and ossicula; indeed,\\n      upon the entire auditory apparatus. I am able to confirm Dr. Garey\\'s\\n      statement of the effect of high and low vibrations us regards treatment.\\n      \\n I have also been very much interested\\n      in the use of stringed or reed instruments for diagnosis, and find that we\\n      can detect any abnormal sensitiveness of the auditory nerve to high or low\\n      tones. Some patients are extremely sensitive to all tones, high or low;\\n      others to high tones and not to low tones; others, conversely. Again, in\\n      some instances, there is a peculiar sensitiveness to single tones or to\\n      discords produced by sounding the note and half-note at the same time.\\n      Under the action of the central attachment of the vibrometer this\\n      sensitiveness is modified, the sensitiveness to high tones disappearing\\n      and being replaced by a low tone or, conversely, under treatment, a low\\n      tone disappears and a high tone is established, temporarily, at least.\\n      Again, in cases of recent origin, treatment will substitute an undefined\\n      rushing sound for a definite musical tone, either high or low, and later,\\n      the treatment will abolish this, the patient being relieved of this\\n      intensely annoying symptom. In some cases, with this relief, there is an\\n      improvement in the audition; in other cases, no improvement follows.\\n      \\n I confess to the domination of the\\n      material over my mind in my earlier experience with massage, and I think\\n      the inclination of operators will be to use a far greater degree of power\\n      than is necessary. I therefore notice with great satisfaction Professor\\n      Garey\\'s remark that \"the object should be to produce a to-and-fro\\n      motion to the membrana tympani, and, if possible, by a force which is\\n      harmless and at the same time effective.\" I would hardly say\\n      \"to-and-fro motion of the drum-head,\" because I think that the\\n      expression is liable to perpetuate the motion which is fixed in the minds\\n      of most physiologists, that the drum-head moves as a whole, with a\\n      to-and-fro motion.\" That is true under the influence of the Politzer,\\n      Siegle\\'s otoscope and similar instruments; but it certainly does not so\\n      move in the ordinary function of audition, but stands as the iris does in\\n      the eye, as an adjustor, a regulator of sound-force; in some sense as the\\n      iris does in its relation with the lens, to adjust, regulate and direct\\n      the essential force, and the vibration of the drum-head is at every node;\\n      every portion receives impressions that are converted into molecular\\n      disturbances of varying lengths, according as they are produced upon the\\n      stiff and unyielding portions of the drum-head at the periphery, along the\\n      manubrium, or in the more attenuated and easily-yielding portions which\\n      the between these two areas. Not only so, but these impulses are\\n      communicated to the contained air of the tympanum, and make their\\n      impression upon the acoustic nerve through the round window synchronously\\n      with the impression made through the ossicula.\\n      \\n This whole subject widens before my\\n      mind in such a way that one might wish himself twenty years and at liberty\\n      to devote himself to a term of research in acoustics, such as is offered\\n      only in the technical schools of the continent of Europe.\\n      \\n WM. R. KING, M.D.: In discussing Dr.\\n      Garey\\'s paper I shall begin by saying that his methods have been closely\\n      followed by me since the beginning of his experiments, owing to the fact\\n      that I have been greatly interested in the treatment of deafness and\\n      tinnitus by means of sound waves or by aural massage since 1887, and have\\n      experimented and treated many cases by this method since then, though with\\n      crude and unsatisfactory instruments. Since using the vibrometer-which,\\n      after much study and experimentation, is now presented to the profession\\n      in practical shape-I have undoubtedly increased my percentage of good\\n      results.\\n      \\n I don\\'t believe I am over-sanguine or\\n      carried away by interest in this method, and believe I can rightly\\n      appreciate that this does not offer us a panacea or cure-all for auditory\\n      ailments, and hope I may always be ready to see the failures and to strive\\n      to find methods or remedies to reach some of them.\\n      \\n In speaking of the application of the\\n      instrument, I wish to call attention to the central attachment or post foe\\n      vibrations. Dr. Garey has not given it as much attention in the paper as\\n      it deserves. It is very useful as a general means of aural massage,\\n      rougher in nature and more general in application than the strings which\\n      help to make up the instrument. I often use it before applying the\\n      \"similar found\" to a given case, as a species of gymnastics, to\\n      stimulate secretion and motion in the conducting apparatus of the ear,\\n      viz., membrana tympani and ossicles. In most cases-in fact, in all-where\\n      tinnitus is present, I follow this up immediately by the nearest approach\\n      to the similar pitch obtainable.\\n      \\n I agree thoroughly with Dr. Garey, that\\n      the best results are achieved in cases accompanying hypertrophic catarrh,\\n      and that the least benefit is apparent in cases of atrophic nature.\\n      \\n Regarding the method of treatment in\\n      the absence of tinnitus, my experience the does not coincide with that of\\n      the author of the paper entirely; I do not feel that as yet we have any\\n      safe rule to guide us. My method has been to try the numerous sounds and\\n      variations the of until I find the one that seems to give the best\\n      immediate results, or that the patient himself will speak of as very\\n      penetrating and powerful )though not necessarily loud and heavy).\\n      \\n It seems almost impossible at present\\n      to simulate all the qualities of tone as they occur in the ears of those\\n      suffering with tinnitus; in fact, it would appear to be unnecessary.\\n      However, it seems advantageous and quite necessary to secure the closest\\n      simulation of pitch, thus in many cases soon obliterating annoying\\n      tinnitus and improving hearing powers.\\n      \\n The arrangement permitting of the\\n      picking of two strings simultaneously adds decidedly the usefulness of the\\n      instrument, as it increases the range of pitch as well as varying the\\n      quality of tones procurable, thereby decidedly enlarging our field of\\n      application.\\n      \\n The force used for creating the message\\n      or gymnastics of the membrana tympani and the ossicles-viz, vibratory\\n      force or sound- carefully and scientifically applied, is nature\\'s remedy,\\n      because it is adapted by nature, and is the only force which can rightly\\n      or safely be applied to these delicate portions of this complex organ of\\n      hearing.\\n      \\n A startling commentary on this subject\\n      is the array of cases benefited who have been relegated to the shelf by\\n      ancient and modern otology; cases declared unhelpable have been vastly\\n      improved. Pray, make no mistake; I did not say all cases.\\n      \\n It may be interesting to hear the\\n      latest regarding the instrument which was first invented for the\\n      application of this method of aural massage Mr. E.J. Godman, the inventor\\n      and patentee, is constantly on the lookout, and always striving for\\n      improvements to his machine. He has made many that you all know of. Permit\\n      me to report a few so recent they have not yet left the factory.\\n      \\n First.-The machine has been taken from\\n      its case, and is now mounted on a solid stand or table of oak, being set\\n      below the level, or so that the face of the instrument is just level with\\n      the face of the table. This is all supported by rigid, solid metal legs,\\n      which absolutely prevent foreign vibrations.\\n      \\n Second.-The motor has been removed from\\n      its little shelf and relegated below the table. I t can be placed upon a\\n      box on the floor, a shelf against the wall, or, better yet, a shelf\\n      solidly attached to the metal supports of the table. A belt goes up\\n      through an aperture to a wheel on a shaft, the other extremity of which\\n      carries a wheel with a rubber tire (a friction wheel), which in its\\n      revolution, being in contact with a larger flat- surfaced wheel on the\\n      main shaft of the instrument, turns this in harmony with itself. This\\n      arrangement does away with the necessity of shifting the motor each time\\n      you wish to shift the carriage from one string to another- a consummation\\n      to be devoutly thankful for. The removal of the motor from the instrument\\n      as at present attached will recommend itself to all who have used the\\n      vibrometer, a great amount of undesirable jar being thus avoided.\\n      \\n Third.-Ratchet keys capable of very\\n      fine adjustment of tension of strings are now provided for the instrument.\\n      \\n Fourth.-A rheostadt or resistance-coil\\n      is now to be placed beneath the table between the storage battery and the\\n      switch, by this means enabling us to control the speed and number of\\n      revolutions to a nicety.\\n      \\n Other, though comparatively minor,\\n      improvements are being made, and others are contemplated, as, for\\n      instance, the substitution of a roughly corrugated rubber band for the\\n      picker on the wheel, thereby getting rid of the metallic sound of the\\n      picker on the wire strings.\\n      \\n I have experimented with a number of\\n      appliance for the production of the sounds and pitches that I have\\n      required, but I always fall back on the vibrometer, especially as at\\n      present constructed, for satisfactory work and results.\\n      \\n This instrument may be, and probably\\n      is, as yet, in its infancy. It, and the method it applies, can only be\\n      perfected by constant work and experimentation both on the part of the\\n      profession and of the manufacturers. Each improvement we can suggest, if\\n      it only should serve as a means of helping one solitary case, would be\\n      well worth our while.\\n      \\n The experiments being made by different\\n      methods for treating deafness by sound waves is indicative of the interest\\n      the profession has taken in the matter. It is indicative of a lack of\\n      something in our usual armamentarium which is greatly longed for by\\n      patient and doctor; that is, the means for making the deaf hear and for\\n      relieving distressing tinnitus. There has been a dearth in this direction,\\n      and perhaps there still is, but I believe fully that we have in aural\\n      massage by vibratory force a decided acquisition at our hands.\\n      \\n E. H. LINNELL., M.D.: I would simply\\n      like to ask Dr. King how long he uses the instrument, and whether he uses\\n      it according to the deafness.\\n      \\n DR. KING: Yes, decidedly. In an intense\\n      case of deafness I would have to use it a great deal longer. The central\\n      attachment I never carry over three or five minutes, and the whole\\n      treatment I don\\'t think is over carried over twenty or twenty-five minutes\\n      in one case, and usually averages from ten to fifteen.\\n      \\n HAROLD WILSON, M.D.: I have only to\\n      suggest, what I have elsewhere called attention to, the possibility of\\n      another mechanical device for securing vibratory motion. It is well known\\n      that in the make and break of a current of electricity, in the circuit of\\n      which there is a telephone, we get an influence upon the make and break of\\n      the current in the telephone. Now, it is a simple matter with which these\\n      makes and breaks are made as to obtaining any number of vibration that you\\n      wish. You may, by a mechanical device of some rotary motion, if you\\n      choose, make and break the current as rapidly as you please until you have\\n      reached several thousand vibrations a second, or you may even make the\\n      vibrations so slow us to be easily counted. The application of this\\n      suggestion has been put in force in my own practice, more or less, in the\\n      use of the telephone as connected with the induction-coil ordinary\\n      battery. The more intense the current, the more intense the sound. You can\\n      easily see that it is mere question of mechanics to secure these two\\n      sounds-intensity of vibration and rapidity of vibration. I will say,\\n      furthermore, that it has this advantage. There is no noise in the office,\\n      which I think is not altogether true of the vibrometer. I would suggest\\n      that so far as the vibrometer is concerned, if it could be made to be\\n      noiseless to anybody but the patient, it would be a decided improvement.\\n      In that respect the telephone is a decided improvement, because there is\\n      no noise except to the patient, because the noise is right at the ear of\\n      the patient. If I were seeking for a perfected instrument in this line, I\\n      would go outside of the banjo idea. As we have the most perfect writing\\n      machines, which have no connection with the ordinary method of writing,\\n      and sewing machines, which have no connection with sewing by hand, so it\\n      occurs to me that possibly the securing of he vibratory motion upon the\\n      ears might be obtained in a totally different way from that which you get\\n      when you listen to the drum of the guitar or an ordinary musical\\n      instrument, and I would suggest that the make and break of a telephone\\n      open a very fruitful field for mechanical experimentation.\\n      \\n H.C. HOUGHTON, M.D.: In my study of\\n      this subject I made the acquaintance of Mr. Bernhardt, of New York City,\\n      who is a personal friend of Mr. Emil Berliner, the inventor of the Emil\\n      Berliner Telephone, which is the instrument by which the Bell Telephone\\n      Company maintain their monopoly at present. Mr. Berliner is the inventor\\n      of the graphophone, and has, I think, covered this whole matter which Dr.\\n      Wilson has mentioned. As ordinary Bell telephone receiver is put into the\\n      circuit of an ordinary induction machine, and you can use it just as the\\n      English people use the audiometer, and as you remove the coil you modify\\n      the vibrations, which is covered with another disk and a tube, and that\\n      tube covered with a stethoscope tube, which is the same as we use for the\\n      phonograph or vibrometer, and, as Dr. Wilson has suggested, you can modify\\n      the intensity, and of course the whole matter is adjusted by the\\n      attachment of the cord, so that you can have fine vibrations. The\\n      intensity of the vibrations is regulated by the distance to which you\\n      uncover the cord. The only difficulty in the adjustment is that it has\\n      been so severe that it is really uncomfortable, and the noise of the\\n      instrument is reduced to the minimum for office use.\\n      \\n A.B. NORTON, M.D.: I will also add that\\n      in regard to the objection Dr. Wilson makes to the noise, there is no\\n      doubt it is an annoying thing in the office, and in that line I have some\\n      men at work on my suggestion. We are devising another machine, or\\n      instrument, which is to be entirely enclosed in a cabinet, so there will\\n      be no noise whatever in the room if it is made a success. The idea is a\\n      little crude, and I am quite uncertain whether it will amount to anything\\n      or not. Then, in the line of what Dr. King was speaking in regard to Mr.\\n      Goodwin-he called, at New York, to see me last week. I made two little\\n      suggestion to him, which I think would be in line with his advancement.\\n      One is the number of the picks. The present vibrometer has four picks I\\n      suggest the experiment of trying twelve or sixteen picks, which will make\\n      a more continuous sound; it may be of some value. Then, in regard to\\n      regulating the speed of the machine: you regulate that now by a series of\\n      buttons, so as to get three different speeds. We will have a very slight,\\n      intermediate speed, and a very rapid speed. My experience with the\\n      vibrometer is especially favorable. I think the idea is in the right\\n      direction, and it is simply a matter of instrumentation.']\n",

Dietary sources of vitamin C include fruits and vegetables, particularly citrus fruits such as oranges.Severe deficiency of vitamin C causes scurvy. Although rare, scurvy results in severe symptoms and can cause death. People with scurvy are treated with vitamin C and should be under medical supervision.Many uses for vitamin C have been proposed, but evidence of benefit in scientific studies is lacking. In particular, research on asthma, cancer, and diabetes remains inconclusive, and a lack of benefit has been found for the prevention of cataracts or heart disease.The use of vitamin C in the prevention or treatment of colds remains controversial. Extensive research has been conducted. Overall, vitamin C lacked an effect on the development of colds and on cold symptoms. However, the duration of the cold shortened slightly. Notably, people living in extreme circumstances, including soldiers in the subarctic, skiers, and marathon runners, had a 50% decrease in the risk of developing a cold. This area merits additional research and may be of particular interest to athletes or people in the military.'\n",

Vitamin B12 is frequently used in combination with other B vitamins in a vitamin B complex formulation. Vitamin B12 is important in DNA synthesis. Vitamin B12 is bound to the protein in food. Acid in the stomach releases B12 from protein during digestion. Once released, B12 combines with a substance called intrinsic factor (IF) before it is absorbed into the bloodstream.The human body stores several years\\' worth of vitamin B12 in the liver, so low levels in the body are rare. Decreases in vitamin B12 levels are more common in the elderly, HIV-infected persons, and vegetarians.

First of all, radium and x-rays are no\\n      longer looked on a last resort.\".\\n      \\n The foregoing bears witness to the\\n      progress made in the field radiation therapy. The manufacture of more\\n      adequate apparatus and the improved technic in its use reflect this\\n      improvement. Machines are used generally delivering twenty to thirty\\n      milliamperes of current at 200 K.V., while machines operating at 750 to\\n      1,000 200 K.V., using lower milliamperes, have been installed in several\\n      places in this country. Since the question of increased voltages began to\\n      dominate the field, machines operating at 400 to 600 K.V., using sealed\\n      tubes, have been manufactured in this country as well as on the been\\n      manufactured in this country as well as on the continent. This higher\\n      powered machines occupy little more space than the usual 200 K.V. machine.\\n      \\n The effectiveness of these stronger\\n      radiations is thought to be due to (1) the increased penetration and its\\n      consequently larger percentage depth doses, (2) the supposed higher\\n      selective action of short have length radiation on malignant cells, and\\n      (3) greatly increased x-ray output. Clinics using super-voltages report\\n      that clinical results are somewhat better than those secured through the\\n      use of the lesser voltage machine.\\n      \\n Experimental effort, from the physical\\n      and biologic point of view, has been exerted to establish to standard\\n      basis for radiotherapy since Roentgens discovery thirtyfive years ago, and\\n      its application five years later. Radiotherapists have only recently begun\\n      to understand the principles of clinical application or radiotherapy in\\n      the treatment of malignant conditions.\\n      \\n Regaud selected the rabbits testicle\\n      for his experiments because its histologic cellular structure was highly\\n      sensitive to radiation, containing cells which are in a state of active\\n      mitosis resembling that of malignant tissue. In 1922, Regaud reported that\\n      of malignant, tissue. In 1922, Regaud reported that it was impossible to\\n      sterilize the testicle by a single dose of radiation without causing\\n      serious damage to the overlying skin. The dose required to produced such\\n      radio necrosis was equivalent to about three radionecrosis was equivalent\\n      to about three erythemas when administered in one dose. However, by\\n      dividing the dose in such a manner as to prolong the treatment over a\\n      period of fourteen days, a total dose of about five erythemas could be\\n      given causing complete sterilizations without damage to the skin. Thus it\\n      is seen that by prolonging the time of treatment the cutaneous dose could\\n      be increased nearly 50 per cent without causing necrosis.\\n      \\n The above experiments were reported,\\n      and the same results determined, by Schinz and Slotopolsky in 1926, and\\n      again by Regaud and Ferroux in 1927. These experiments formed the\\n      foundation for the clinical studies of Pfahler (America), Hohlfelder\\n      (Germany) and Coutard (France), who have swung the pendulum from massive\\n      radiation, as advocated by the German school, to that of the protected\\n      fractional dose method. Results have been achieved by this method which\\n      are superior to previously reported; these are obtained by the improved\\n      method of administering a large dose to the (3 days) without causing\\n      destructive effects to the surroundings normal structure (or cancer bed);\\n      its effect are rather biologic than physical. The clinical application of\\n      the method of radiation by Pfahler, Countard, and Berven (Sweden) in the\\n      treatment of cancer of the tonsil, pharynx and larynx and have proved the\\n      radio-sensitive properties of squamous carcinoma, previously considered\\n      incapable of of responding to radiation.\\n      \\n According to Coutard, the neoplasm is\\n      exposed to x-rays twice daily, giving a total dose of 350 r to400 r to two\\n      areas, using 190 to 200 k.v., four milliamperes, two millimeters of copper\\n      and three millimeters of aluminum filtration at a distance of fifty of\\n      sixty centimeters, for lesion of the head and neck. For deeply situated\\n      lesions, such as cancer of the uterus, the focal distance varies from 80\\n      to 100 centimeters, the area of the field for the head and neck conditions\\n      being only 50 to 100 square centimeters, while those of the lower abdomen\\n      require on an average of 250 to 300 square centimeters. For the\\n      sterilization of the radio-sensitive squamous carcinomatous growth, a\\n      depth dose of 3,000 r to 4,000 r is given, while stronger dose is\\n      necessary for the radio-resistant tumors.\\n      \\n In the course of treatment of principle\\n      guides a radio reaction of the covering epithelium and the radio reaction\\n      of the cancer cells. The radio reaction of the cutaneous epithelium is\\n      called \"radio epidermitis.\"characterized by loss of epithelial\\n      layers and denudation of the dermis. The reaction of the mucous membrane ,\\n      called \"radio epithelitis,\" manifests itself by loss of the\\n      epithelial layer sand denudation of the mucous membrane, epithelial layers\\n      and denudation of the corium which becomes covered by a fibrinous and\\n      false membrane; of clear. The duration of both describe radio reactions is\\n      six weeks. Each appears at the beginning of three weeks and disappears at\\n      the beginning of the ninth week.\\n      \\n Should the total or daily dose or the\\n      intensity per minute be too high, or the filtration or the tension too\\n      low, the cancer bed would be modified. the nutrition of the malignant\\n      cells becomes impaired The cellular radio- sensitivity, which seems to be\\n      linked up not only with the mitosis of the cell but above all with the\\n      activity of their interchange with the cell but above all with the\\n      activity of their interchange with the surrounding normal structures,\\n      becomes diminished and at times suppressed. The cancer cells become\\n      incentive to radiation. This phenomenon is called \"radio-\\n      vaccination\" by Regaud.\\n      \\n Observation of clinical facts shows\\n      that changes in the surrounding normal tissue result from excessive daily\\n      doses and intensity per minute per minute causing radio resistance of the\\n      tissue. Conversely, radio- sensitivity would be prolonged with a smaller\\n      daily dosage and the resultant extended period.\\n      \\n Realizing that better results may be\\n      obtained by prolonged treatment, Coutard and his collaborators in the last\\n      few years have begun to extend the duration of treatment of certain\\n      so-called radio-resistant cancers from thirty to ninety days, giving weak\\n      daily doses in order of about 175, 220, 225 and 250 r per day, dividing\\n      the dose in two treatments. By this method he was able to cure a certain\\n      number of lesions on which he had not been able previously to obtain the\\n      same results, such as very differentiated epidermoid epithelioma invading\\n      the muscles and cartilages, glandular epithelioma of the breast ad the\\n      thyroid body, and special round celled epitheliomas of the upper part of\\n      the ethmoid and the adjacent sinuses. This mode of prolonged treatment not\\n      only controlled the condition locally but it lessened the frequency of\\n      metastasis.\\n      \\n When radiating a cancer of very\\n      embryonic, very radio-sensitive growths, the energy factor is predominant.\\n      The action of the x-rays seems to be direct and rapid; the treatment can\\n      be accomplished within fifteen to twenty days. The cells are destroyed and\\n      generally normal structures are affected very little. When radiating the\\n      less embryonic type of growths, the time of treatment should be longer.\\n      \\n Pursuing these general principles, I\\n      have adopted the Countard method with some slight modifications. The cures\\n      which I shall illustrate will show that the percentage of cures in a\\n      number of most dangerous epidermoid carcinomas has markedly increased and\\n      that some conditions formerly considered hopeless have been temporarily\\n      cured. In conclusion I wish to emphasize the following facts:.\\n      \\n (1) Cure of cancer by x-rays is still\\n      difficult and must not be entered into lightly and causally.\\n      \\n (2) Radiotherapy is just as radical in\\n      method as surgery, and requires great skill, judgment and experience.\\n      \\n (3) The cooperation of the pathologist\\n      and the radiotherapist is imperative for a proper estimate of the\\n      radio-sensitivity in relation to treatment of the lesion.\\n      \\n (4) Daily examination of the patient is\\n      necessary; modification of the normal structure and general reaction by\\n      the x-ray treatment sometimes appears to quickly that it is often\\n      necessary to diminish the daily dose or the size of the field in the\\n      course of treatment.\\n      \\n (5) There exists no fixed method of\\n      treatment, only a simple clinical treatment for each individual patient\\n      and for the special type of tumor..\\n      \\n (6) Improvement in roentgen apparatus\\n      of higher voltages, producing more penetrating rays, will permit a better\\n      relation between destruction of malignant cells and preservation of the\\n      supporting, and the radio sensitivity of the tumor may be prolonged.'\n",
      " 'Tresorie - ALL INDIA HOMOEOPATHIC CONVENTION WELCOME ADDRESS [All India\\nHomoeopathic Convention Welcome Address]\\n\\n Mr. President, Friends and Colleagues.\\n      \\n It fills my heart with joy unspeakable\\n      to extend a hearty welcome to you all to this city at this All India\\n      Homoeopathic Convention held on the occasion of Bi-centennial Birth-day\\n      Anniversary of our great Master Hahnemann. This is the city where\\n      Homoeopathy was first introduced by Rajendra Lal Dutta of hallowed memory,\\n      who spent a princely fortune for dissemination of its principles and\\n      practice among his countrymen. This is the city where took place the\\n      dramatic conversion of one of the then medical luminaries of the first\\n      magnitude, to the practice of Homoeopathy under the influence of Rajendra\\n      Lal. I mean Dr. Mahendra Lal Sircar who became the high priest of\\n      Homoeopathy, spread its glory far and wide and gained thereby an\\n      international reputation for himself. This is the city where the\\n      celebrities of Homoeopathy like Dr. Berigny, Dr. Salzar, Dr. P.C.\\n      Majumdar, Dr. D. N. Roy. Dr. Younan, Dr. J.N. Majumdar, Dr. Baridbaran\\n      Mukherji, Dr. S.K. Nag, Dr. A.N. Mukherji, Dr. T.N. Palit, Dr. G.\\n      Dirghangi and a host of other talented physicians practised their\\n      profession with credit and success and held aloft the banner of\\n      Homoeopathy. This is the city where exist pioneer institutions for the\\n      teaching of Homoeopathy. This is the city wherefrom Homoeopathy has spread\\n      to all parts of India and its votaries are doing yeomans service for the\\n      good of the suffering humanity.\\n      \\n We are meeting this evening on a\\n      historic occasion and we have to arrive at decisions which might make or\\n      mar the future history of Homoeopathy in India. It may be that forces of\\n      disruption, destruction and obstruction are at work; it may be that self\\n      and vested interests seem to thwart the smooth progress of Homoeopathy; it\\n      may be that some may seem to play in the hands of the Powers that are not\\n      too sympathetic to the cause of Homoeopathy; it may be that the present\\n      seems to be chaotic and future of Homoeopathy dubious but great is truth\\n      indeed and will prevail. We should not lose heart or throw up the sponge.\\n      Tradition, authority, sectarianism, dogmatism are great obstacles on the\\n      way. But obstacles and difficulties are meant to be fought out and\\n      overcome. Strifes and dissensions, discords and disunities may hamper our\\n      progress but they are nonetheless signs of lifes activities. It is a good\\n      augury that the Homoeopathic profession is shaking off its age - long\\n      slumber and getting more and more conscious of its duties and obligation,\\n      its rights and privileges and of its short - comings and practical\\n      difficulties. The life of Hahnemann is there to encourage us; the\\n      masterful will of his dynamic spirit is there to inspire us to intensify\\n      our activities; his achievements are there to goad us to realise greater\\n      success; and his personality is always before us to take lessons from, in\\n      our life which as Swami Vivekananda puts it, is \"a process of\\n      unfolding and development of a being under circumstances tending to press\\n      it down.\"\\n      \\n That Homoeopathy is a scientific system\\n      of treatment, philosophically sound, logically unimpeachable, practically\\n      highly efficacious in curing the sick and cheap enough to suit the poor\\n      economic condition of the Indian masses - has become a much talked - of\\n      subject in the country. But why is it not spreading sufficiently and\\n      adequately in our motherland or in fact anywhere in the world? Why is our\\n      National Government not still keen on according official recognition to\\n      this superb system of healing art or providing ways and means for its\\n      development and diffusion? Why the public opinion is not gaining strength\\n      enough to put sufficient pressure on our Government to take interest in\\n      it? Why sufficient number of fully equipped Homoeopathic teaching\\n      institutions and hospitals are not growing to turn out adequate number of\\n      fully qualified Homoeopathic physicians in the country?\\n      \\n It is high time that we should draw the\\n      attention of the profession and the laity to provide answers to so many\\n      \"whys\" and to solve the pressing problems in the matter\\n      concerned. On a cursory view it becomes evident that the Homoeopathic\\n      profession, the people and the Government are each individually and\\n      collectively responsible for this impasse.\\n      \\n The so - called Allopathy still\\n      occupies the dominant place in any country, even in the land of birth of\\n      Homoeopathy. It is no wonder that Homoeopathy, being a discovery of merely\\n      a century and a half still lags behind its rival shool. But it is a wonder\\n      of wonders that Homoeopathy has already encompassed the whole world within\\n      such a short period since it was ushered into existence by Hahnemann.\\n      History of man reveals that nowhere a new truth was accepted by him easily\\n      and readily, obsessed as he is with conservatism, tradition, authority and\\n      vested interests. Nonetheless the triumphant march of Homoeopathy with a\\n      such a meteoric speed throughout the length and breadth of the world is a\\n      proof positive of the truth inherent in the system and phenomenal\\n      therapeutic efficacy of this healing art. It is one more glaring instance\\n      of mans love of truth against heavy odds that impede his progress at every\\n      step.\\n      \\n For the propagation of any new truth\\n      and its acceptance by man, in general, the first and foremost condition is\\n      the turning out of sufficient number of persons who have realised the\\n      truth and are adept in the practice of it. This involves establishment of\\n      a sufficient number of teaching institutions which will turn out experts\\n      in the science and art of Homoeopathy; and a sufficient number of\\n      Homoeopathic Hospital where, the efficacy of this system of treatment will\\n      be put to test.\\n      \\n Human knowledge is becoming\\n      unmanageably vast. The appearance of specialists has become indispensable.\\n      So special Hospitals for the treatment of specific types of diseases have\\n      sprung forth elsewhere, e.g. Tuberculosis Hospitals, Cancer Hospitals,\\n      Hospital for Tropical Diseases etc. Because of organisation of these\\n      hospitals people generally think of getting themselves treated in these\\n      institutions. As there are no fully - equipped general Homoeopathic\\n      Hospitals and not to speak of special Homoeopathic Hospitals and not to\\n      speak of special Homoeopathic Hospitals the result is Homoeopathy is not\\n      getting a fair chance of treating those diseases like tuberculosis,\\n      cancer, acute infectious diseases of epidemic type e.g., Small-pox,\\n      Cholera etc. on a large and organised scale. Consequently the general\\n      public cannot keep much faith in this treatment and mostly take recourse\\n      to homoeopathic treatment when the case is \"past all hope and past\\n      all surgery\". Hence the establishment of fully - equipped\\n      Homoeopathic institutions (College - cum - Hospitals) is an imperative\\n      necessity for enhancing the prestige of the Homoeopathic profession and\\n      for convincing the people about the therapeutic efficacy of this system of\\n      treatment. Is it not a pity that Homoeopathy once established its\\n      reputation by treating Cholera cases in this city and now nobody thinks of\\n      this treatment in Cholera cases and rushes the patient to the Allopathic\\n      Hospitals which are especially meant for these types of patients? How can\\n      we hope to gain ground under these circumstances?\\n      \\n The next great obstacle is the apathy\\n      and in many cases active antagonism of our Government, both at the Centre\\n      and at least in some of the State, towards Homoeopathy. The Government is\\n      under the thumb of its medical directorates which are solely manned by\\n      Allopathic doctors. The main reasons for the non - acceptance of the\\n      Homoeopathic system of treatment may be summed up in three words:\\n      tradition, authority and professionalism. Their psychology is easily\\n      understood if it is borne in mind that the conservative inertia of human\\n      mind attempts to reject any new thought will all the means at its\\n      disposal. Another reason is due to vested interests. Even a cursory glance\\n      at the history of origin and spread of Homoeopathy, enables one to find\\n      out that the opposition to this system from the start, was not scientific\\n      but rather of commercial nature on the part of the apothecaries who were\\n      afraid of losing their trade - profits. We regret to note that the Central\\n      Government have not yet implemented a single recommendation put forward by\\n      the Homoeopathic Enquiry Committee, Planning Commission. Third Health\\n      Ministers Conference, Ad Hoc Committee etc. though Homoeopathic Acts have\\n      been passed in the States of Bombay, U.P., Madhya Pradesh, Travancore -\\n      Cochin, Bihar etc. I is curious to note that W. Bengal is the only State\\n      where a Homoeopathic Bill has recently been thrown out by the State\\n      Government.\\n      \\n Another great obstacle is the\\n      psychology of the general mass of population who fail to adopt a proper\\n      philosophical attitude towards Homoeopathy and takes the Homoeopathic\\n      Therapeutic Law as great paradox contrary to common sense. Unless we can\\n      educate the public in the matter, we cannot hope to secure their whole -\\n      hearted support for this system of treatment.\\n      \\n Lack of enthusiasm for constructive\\n      works on the part of the Homoeopathic profession, the apathy of our\\n      Government and hesitancy on the part of the public to accept Homoeopathy\\n      are great obstacles to the spread of this system of treatment in the\\n      country. Unless this vicious circles is broken the progress of Homoeopathy\\n      is bound to be impeded. We have to fight on all fronts if we aspire to\\n      achieve victory in our battle for the cause of Homoeopathy and the\\n      suffering humanity.\\n      \\n But our first necessity as pointed out\\n      by the Soul of India expressing itself through Sri Aurobindo, is: If India\\n      is to survive and do her appointed work in the world, the youth of India\\n      should learn to think, to think on all subjects, to think independently,\\n      fruitfully, going to the heart of things, not stopped by their surface,\\n      free of pre - judgements, shearing sophism and prejudice asunder as with a\\n      sharp sword smiting down obscurantism of all kinds as with a mace of\\n      Bhima.\\n      \\n \"Let our brains no longer, like\\n      European infants, be swathed with swaddling clothes; let it have recover\\n      the free and unbound motion of the Gods, let it have not only the\\n      minuteness but the wide mastery and sovereignty natural to the intellect\\n      of Bharata and easily recoverable by it if it once accustomes itself to\\n      feel its own power and be convinced of its own worth.\\n      \\n \"The old fixed foundations have\\n      been broken up, we are tossing in the waters of a great upheaval and\\n      change. It is no use clinging to the old ice - floes of the past, they\\n      will soon melt and leave their refugees struggling in perilous waters. It\\n      is no use landing ourselves in the infirm bog, neither sea nor good, dry\\n      land of a second - hand Europeanism. We shall only die there a miserable\\n      and unclean death.\\n      \\n \"No we must learn to swim and use\\n      that power to reach the good vessel of unchanging truth; we must land\\n      again on the eternal rock of ages.\"\\n      \\n Yes, we must expand, we must assimilate\\n      whatever is assimilable for our growth. Stagnation and contraction are the\\n      signs of Death. Our knowledge must be aggressive, must diffuse through the\\n      rank and file of the whole Homoeopathic profession if we wish to survive\\n      and perpetuate ourselves; to leave an extensive ignorance either below or\\n      around us is to expose ourselves to the perpetual danger of being\\n      exterminated as a professional entity.\\n      \\n In fine, I welcome you, once again, on\\n      this historic occasion to this historic city to deliberate, to exchange\\n      view points and to come to agreed decisions with regard to our future line\\n      of action in respect of Homoeopathy in all its aspects.'\n",
      " 'Tresorie - SOME OBSERVATIONS ON NEURASTHENIA AND ITS TREATMENT\\n[Neurasthenia & Treatment]\\n\\n WHEN, thirty-five years ago, the writer\\n      first made the acquaintance of what is now called neurasthenia, it was\\n      known as spinal irritation, and the best of modern researches have been\\n      unable to give a better definition beyond a functional disturbance of the\\n      spinal and cerebral nerves, dependent on a morbid process, for which\\n      \"irritation\" is as proper a term as any. As deaths do not occur,\\n      autopsies throw no light on the subject. Briefly stated, neurasthenia,\\n      when observed from the beginning through its chronic course, has a period\\n      of prodromal symptoms followed by a protracted acute, and succeeded by a\\n      still more protracted chronic, state, between the end of which and the\\n      beginning of convalescence there is a very vague, often indiscernible,\\n      boundary line.\\n      \\n The prodromal symptoms are quite\\n      indefinite and very variable, pointing to nothing in particular. Loss of\\n      appetite, irregular sleep, excitability alternating with lassitude, etc.,\\n      are often overlooked, especially when the second stage-display of unusual\\n      mental and physical energy without subsequent fatigue- becomes apparent.\\n      This is often mistaken for a sign of unusually good health. When a young\\n      girl or mature woman, married or unmarried, feels that she can study ten\\n      hours a day and devote half of her night to pleasure or business; when\\n      besides much mental occupation she begins to rejoice in long walks without\\n      fatigue, that is the time when the mischief is going on without exciting\\n      timely suspicion. Relief is at last sought when the functional disorder of\\n      the nerves has gone to the opposite extreme, and becomes manifest in what\\n      is properly and popularly termed \"nervous prostration,\" when\\n      instead of having no sense of fatigue, the best bodily or mental effort\\n      seems intolerable, in grave cases rendering the patient a helpless being,\\n      completely dependent on the unremitting assistance of others whom she )it\\n      is usually a woman) rules with the inexorable power of the vis inertiae.\\n      \\n During this usually very protracted\\n      period of the disease convalescence usually sets in, but so imperceptibly\\n      that the physician alone can sometimes estimate its progress, which is\\n      unnoticeable to others towards whom the patient acts as she has for months\\n      or years. This is the time for action, too often delayed from motives of\\n      misplaced sympathy on the part of relatives and friends.\\n      \\n The affections is in many instances\\n      limited to the spine, the mind becoming only secondarily tired. In other\\n      cases it is spinal and cerebral; in others again chiefly cerebral. The\\n      line between this and insanity is always clearly definable. Though a\\n      neurasthenic patient may become insane, and probably the reverse, yet both\\n      are distinct conditions.\\n      \\n Books speak of this disease at common\\n      to men and women. Yet in this region in small towns as well as in large\\n      cities the cases of neurasthenia in women are preponderatingly great.\\n      \\n Hypochondriacs and hysteria stand in\\n      peculiar relation to neurasthenia. They maybe regarded as different\\n      species of the same genus; that is, more or less deeply seated\\n      disturbances of the cerebro-spinal system in which the sympathetic system\\n      is probably indirectly involved, as many functional disturbances presided\\n      over by the great sympathetic system often testify. Hypochondriasis, pure\\n      and simple as occurring in men, is easily distinguishable by its striking\\n      characteristic of introspection and despondency, occasioned by abnormal\\n      sensations, without marked physical weakness and tiredness. Pure\\n      hypochondriacs are often energetic, conscientious workers. In hysteria\\n      there is neither great tiredness nor tendency to introspection, but a\\n      paroxysmal or prolonged absence of the power of self control, in grave\\n      cases associated with tonic or clonic muscular spasm and loss of\\n      consciousness. While neurasthenia in its uncomplicated forms is free from\\n      these symptoms, but, as ample experience teaches, often complicated with\\n      both of the preceding forms to such an extent that it is often very\\n      difficult to tell which is primary and which secondary. The symptoms known\\n      as introspection, hysterical aberrations of the emotions, and neurasthenic\\n      sense of exhaustion are in their distinctive manifestations most important\\n      and constitute indications in the selection of remedial and dietetic\\n      measures.\\n      \\n The following are some observation of\\n      peculiarities observed in a large number of cases and peculiar to all:.\\n      \\n Introspection.-The neurasthenic patient\\n      in variably expresses her desire for relief, not so much in a direct\\n      appeal as in a supplicating, subdued tone of voice and manner. She rarely\\n      asks, \"What can you do to relieve me?\" but almost invariably,\\n      \"What is the cause of\" this or that sensation? If she is\\n      introspective, that is, hypochondriacal, she becomes a nosomaniac,\\n      watching acutely every one of her numerous distressing sensation, on the\\n      unremitting analysis of which her mind dwells. In marked cases she is\\n      quite unable to think of anything outside of herself, and in many cases\\n      dislikes to do so, preferring to river her attention on herself. Attempts\\n      to divert her annoy or anger her. Friends and relatives implore the\\n      physician to divert the patient, but all their attempts are in vain\\n      because quite misdirected.\\n      \\n Positive and Negative Will.-It seems\\n      sometimes as if the patient delights in her self-inspection, and that she\\n      prefers her condition to speedy recovery. This is not the case, for the\\n      patient will always assure the physician of her wish to get well. During\\n      the acute stage-a long yet definable period-this wish and longing cannot\\n      well be utilized, but the long and ill-defined period of convalescence\\n      must first be awaited. Here we shall always discover that the wish and the\\n      will of the patient are two very different mental conditions. The desire\\n      or wish for recovery is entirely unattended by any will effort to\\n      accomplish the desired end. The injunctions and directions of the\\n      physician are resisted by the same unconquerable power of negative power,\\n      or vis inertiae. The patient having been unable to exert her will, now\\n      thinks herself unable to use it.\\n      \\n Numerous Symptoms of Patients.-To\\n      physicians in search of indications for medicines each statement of\\n      patient concerning a sensation is apt to be considered as a symptom. Many\\n      years ago, when resolved to get at the keynote of a patient\\'s case, the\\n      writer determined to allow the patient to detail all her symptoms as long\\n      as she chose and to take accurate notes of each one till the right one\\n      should be disclosed; and this was to be done regardless of time and\\n      exertion. The patient, one who needed no urging to describe her\\n      \"symptoms,\" began in an almost inaudible voice, detailing one\\n      sensation after another with an unrivalled degree of clearness and\\n      vividness of expression; as she proceeded the voice became stronger, her\\n      face slightly flushed, and the most perfect descriptive language flowed in\\n      an endless stream. Each word was written down, page after page was filled;\\n      still she went on with unmistakable signs of satisfaction at being able to\\n      pour her pent-up emotions into willing and sympathetic ears. If, for a\\n      moment, the flow of language was interrupted, a simple question would\\n      re-animate her to proceed with renewed energy. Feelings seemed to beget\\n      feelings; their complexity gave the patient no trouble; her intellect was\\n      equal to the action of unraveling the most complicated sensation,\\n      separating them into their component parts and spreading them out before\\n      the mind of the listener. A glance at the watch showed that nearly two\\n      hours had passed, during which the feeblest of neurasthenic patients had\\n      talked incessantly. The note-book was full, the keynote was found. It was\\n      this: neurasthenic patients have innumerable sensation and exhibit no\\n      sings of fatigue after talking incessantly for nearly two hours.\\n      \\n Great Endurance of Neurasthenics.-The\\n      instance just related, which is one of many, illustrates two things. One\\n      is, that it is not the kind of sensation described but the fact that\\n      neurasthenics have innumerable sensations, that constitute the symptoms.\\n      The other thing is that many neurasthenics are capable of great exertion\\n      without suffering disagreeable after- effects from fatigue. This is\\n      illustrated by other cases of which I have notes. A highly neurasthenic\\n      young lady consented to camp out for her health near a lake. She was\\n      induced to join a party for a short walk along the lake. By trying what\\n      they thought a shorter road the party lost their way and took a very long\\n      walk of about four hours, through bogs and over forces. The neurasthenic\\n      was less fatigued than some of the others. The interesting observation was\\n      subsequently made that the patient had become interested in a young man of\\n      the party. She recovered her health within a year from that time. Other\\n      cases of this kind will appear under the head of therapeutic suggestions.\\n      \\n Neurasthenic Patients Crave\\n      Sympathy.-This is one of the most formidable obstacles to the curative\\n      management of such cases, for the kind of sympathy such patients crave is\\n      expressions of condolence and more or less deep affliction at so much\\n      suffering as the patient expresses. Such sympathy is most natural and does\\n      honor to the feelings of parents, sisters, brothers and husbands, but it\\n      is unfortunate that the deeper their expression of affliction so much the\\n      more profound will be the mental dejection and weakness of the patient.\\n      Almost every case which has come under the writer\\'s observation has been\\n      much hampered if not made hopeless by this condition of things, against\\n      which no remedy suggests itself that would not be construed as\\n      \"unkind\".\\n      \\n The origin of this very formidable and\\n      refractory nervous disease, like that of most diseases usually termed\\n      chronic, is either hereditary or acquired, as the histories of every\\n      observed case plainly testify. Either the father was a hypochondriac or\\n      the mother neurasthenic, or both parents were of unsound nervous\\n      constitution. Dipsomania on the part of parents produces neurasthenia in\\n      the children, as readily as it will be followed by any other form of\\n      nervous disease, according to the individual predisposition of the\\n      offspring. The excessive use of tea and coffee is another very active\\n      factor in the history of neurasthenics. Where fathers inclined to alcohol,\\n      mothers are addicted to tea and coffee, which, while its immediate effects\\n      do not obtrude themselves upon our notice, are none the less insidious in\\n      their more remote consequences.\\n      \\n The acquired forms of neurasthenia are\\n      of utmost interest to the therapeutist, and the sources of acquisition are\\n      readily stated. They are much brain-work with insufficient food and sleep.\\n      Such conditions obtain chiefly in women (less frequently in men) of fine\\n      intellectual ability, conscientiousness and ambition. Physical overwork\\n      with unintellectual women has no such effect. Quite analogous to the above\\n      are the conditions of care and sorrow, especially in women who are able\\n      for a long time to conceal and control their emotions. The usual\\n      consequence of such states of mind is disregard of food and insufficient\\n      sleep. Instances of acquired neurasthenia are presented in families of\\n      several girls and boys, where one or more of the former are Neurasthenic\\n      while the latter are vigorous and athletic. Boys delighting in vigorous\\n      exercise do not, as is the case with girls, lose appetite and sleep.\\n      \\n The effects of nervous exhaustion in\\n      boys are usually much less grave than in girls; as a rule such effects are\\n      manifested in mental, not muscular, tiredness, and they are relieved by\\n      air and exercise, while in girls and women those influences are shunned\\n      because they seem to increase the tiredness.\\n      \\n Predisposition-The temperament, or what\\n      in modern pharaseology is called the personal equation, plays a visible\\n      but uncontrollable part in the progress of neurasthenia, as temperament\\n      greatly determines the other imperfectly known condition known as\\n      predisposition. Where the disease is hereditary, it is easy to say that\\n      the predisposition is due to that source; where there is no history of\\n      heredity and where neurasthenia exists in the last members of a\\n      generation, it may be attributed to acquired predisposition which needed\\n      only the exciting cause to establish the disease in its most typical form.\\n      \\n One of the most common forms of\\n      neurasthenia, often quite intractable, results from a serious defect in\\n      our public school system, one which affects chiefly girls from twelve to\\n      fourteen years of age. The following is a brief example: The child rises\\n      late with no appetite for breakfast and no time to eat it if so inclined.\\n      The lessons, however, have been learned the evening before, and the school\\n      work is begun with an ambitions will and a crammed mind, and continues\\n      with one intermission of often not more than ten minutes or three of four\\n      hours. The pupil arrives at home ravenously hungry, eats too fast, and too\\n      much of injudiciously prepared food, too long in digesting to leave room\\n      for an appetite for even a light evening meal, or even for a breakfast the\\n      next morning.\\n      \\n In another case the girl or boy grows\\n      desperately hungry while at school, but being unprovided with food\\n      (lunch), goes on with the school exercises, at the end of which the sense\\n      of hunger has vanished and has been replaced by an aversion to normal\\n      food, with a possible craving for something pungent and indigestible. This\\n      observation can easily be made in many instances, and will, in as many\\n      cases, be seen to lead to nervous prostration, which is then treated by\\n      vile, patented concoctions consisting largely of whiskey, under the name\\n      of \"tonics,\" while the patient needs only the best that a\\n      legitimate market affords prepared in a sensible manner.\\n      \\n Typical Cases Ending in Rapid\\n      Recovery.-Curative results have already been indicated in what has been\\n      said above, and further indications for treatment may be gathered from a\\n      few cases of extremely rapid recovery of apparently incurable cases, to\\n      which brief allusion will here be made. A woman of forty had been a victim\\n      of grave neurasthenia for five years. In the absence of an inclination to\\n      exert himself, she had, during that period, been mostly confined to her\\n      bed or lounge, in the meantime giving birth to two children, going through\\n      gestation and confinement normally, without recovering from neurasthenic\\n      prostration which, in the course of some years more, rendered her entirely\\n      helpless. Her condition was associated with a feeling of dropping to\\n      pieces unless supported and braced by a harness of wood, iron and leather,\\n      in which she \"sat up\" for several hours each day, spending the\\n      rest of the time in bed. Having left the patient in this condition, it was\\n      reported before the writer\\'s next professional visit that Mrs.-had been\\n      cured, and that she was able to go out like other people. A visit to the\\n      house confirmed the report. The patient came to the door herself, and in a\\n      quiet manner, entirely without the least expression of joy or wonder at\\n      her release, stated, that having heard of a famous \"magnetic\\n      physician,\" she summoned him, was ordered by him to arise and stand;\\n      protesting that it was impossible, she was raised to her feet and again\\n      ordered to stand, then to walk. Fearing that she would fall, she begged\\n      the magnetic doctor to support her, which he peremptorily refused, saying\\n      she might fall if she liked. Instead of falling, she had to walk about the\\n      room, was then placed upon a lounge and subjected to a severe treatment of\\n      rolling and pummelling, and then ordered to dress and sit up until tired,\\n      to remain up and about like other people, and to call on the doctor in\\n      future, as he would not come so far to the patient again. This happened\\n      about twenty-five years ago, and the patient has been in very fair health\\n      arrested by insisting that all professional visits by the writer or any\\n      other physician to whose sympathy the patient could appeal must cease.\\n      This injunction was carried out conscientiously with the best results by\\n      the husband of the patient. Perhaps we may learn from this that sometimes,\\n      at least, the familiar motto is reversed, and angels rush in where fools\\n      fear to tread.\\n      \\n Profiting by this experience, another\\n      neurasthenic woman, unmarried, but of most intractable, antagonistic\\n      temperament, confined to her bed, in and out of hospitals, for years,\\n      wearing out the strength and means of her relatives and the patience of\\n      many physicians, was at length abandoned by them. It was a case of spinal\\n      and cerebral neurasthenia complicated with hypochondriasis in its most\\n      trying form of introspective maunderings and endless description of\\n      symptoms. She tormented her advisers by her endless tirades, the\\n      indulgence of which invariably aggravated her condition, and were there\\n      fore avoided, until once her physician yielded to the patient\\'s\\n      importunities for a visit, when be found her in her usual abject state of\\n      prostration. Guided by experience derived from cases like the one first\\n      described, he assisted the patient to her feet and marched her, will you\\n      nil you, up and down the room until he, at least, was thoroughly tired,\\n      and then departed with the promise never to do so again. The patient, on\\n      her part, made a number of her unnameable promises, but kept on her feet\\n      and let the doctors alone. Though not cured of deeply-rooted morbid mental\\n      faults, the neurasthenic phase of her condition had yielded to the change\\n      of the antagonistic element of her character from passive to very\\n      practical activity. A third very serious case of this kind occurred in the\\n      person of a girl of fifteen, of selfish character, who gradually became\\n      bed-ridden with spinal and cerebral neurasthenia, and tormented with the\\n      usual multifarious painful sensations, none of which, on the most\\n      pains-taking physical examination, resulted from demonstrable organic\\n      disease of genital or abdominal organs. The patient was most tenderly\\n      cared for by her mother, who, in the course of years, became so imbued\\n      with the idea of yielding to every wish and whim of the patient, that at\\n      length remonstrance became useless. The mother, though recognizing the\\n      importance of persuading or urging her daughter to depend more on herself,\\n      admitted that she had yielded so long that now she must continue to feed,\\n      dress and assist her charge in the most trivial things. Her food had to be\\n      placed in her mouth, the position of a hand or foot changed by some one\\n      else, although patient did so spontaneously when she chose. This went on\\n      for fifteen years, when the mother, growing old and feeble, died. Her\\n      maternal support being gone, the patient at once proved her ability to\\n      walk, to dress, to feed herself, and to seek light employment. Though far\\n      from well, she is equally far fro being a helpless, bed-ridden invalid.\\n      \\n A fourth case, still very vividly\\n      impressed on the writer\\'s mind, was one of a healthy, romping girl of 14,\\n      who, as happen in this remarkably capricious disease, in the midst of\\n      perfect health, one day took to her bed and remained there with all the\\n      symptoms of neurasthenia, involving first the spinal and finally the\\n      cerebral nerves. This patient was very amiable, conscientious, and\\n      sensible, never loquacious, and not troubled with hypochondriacal thoughts\\n      or sensations. Tiredness was the only expression she used in describing\\n      her feelings. There was literally no variation from this condition, which\\n      confined her to her bed for years, till she grew from a girl to a woman.\\n      Eating and sleeping well, and improving perceptibly in personal appearance\\n      and character, yet she lay on her couch tired and watched over with\\n      unremitting care by a most anxious mother, showing her solicitude and\\n      sympathy in every feature. Once, in the second year of the disease, a\\n      favorable interruption occurred. The mother, still a young woman, gave\\n      birth to another child. During her confinement the neurasthenic patient\\n      was in charge of her mother\\'s nurse, assisted by other servants. The\\n      nurse, while devoted to the daughter, agreed with the writer that excess\\n      of sympathy was injurious, and used her best and judicious endeavors\\n      gradually to persuade the patient to make some physical effort at walking\\n      and standing. In this she was so successful that in two weeks she\\n      accompanied the girl on half-mile walks up and down hill, finally without\\n      assistance. Thus, recovery seemed assured, and everything was favorable\\n      progressing towards it when the mother, having fully recovered, again took\\n      charge of her daughter, with the result that she at once took to her\\n      lounge and remained there two years longer. About that time other advice\\n      was urged and gladly acceded to, with the result that the case was\\n      diagnosed by an eminent surgeon as spinal paralysis in consequence of\\n      concussion, though it could never be shown when and where it occurred.\\n      Salves, plasters, anodynes, nervines, and electricity did no good, but\\n      effectually destroyed appetite and digestion, which higher to had been\\n      normal. So this adviser resigned in favor of a third, who, being a younger\\n      and less prejudiced man, agreed perfectly with the writer\\'s original\\n      opinion. He advised return to moderate exercise, avoidance of drugs, and\\n      less display of sympathy. This, though formerly rejected as\\n      \"unkind,\" was now acceded to as coming from a nerve- specialist,\\n      fresh from Europe, at that time very rare. Still attending the other\\n      members of the family, the writer had sample opportunity of observing the\\n      course of the case. Improvement was very slow and uncertain till financial\\n      misfortune overtook the family. Almost with a bound our patient left her\\n      cough, and, organizing a kindergarten, strove energetically in supporting\\n      herself and assisting her mother. The change came about in less than three\\n      weeks, and resulted in perfect recovery.\\n      \\n At this point another very instructive\\n      case of very speedy recovery, after six or seven years of neurasthenic\\n      prostration, deserves to be mentioned. A woman of 35 had been in bed and\\n      on the lounge most of the time for nearly seven years, at the end of which\\n      time she became my patient, her regular medical attendant having gone to\\n      Europe. She was of very amiable disposition and as sensitive as she was\\n      weak. Her symptoms, as in the other cases, were instantaneous exhaustion\\n      on the least physical exertion. She could give herself up to no mental\\n      occupation beyond directing her house-hold affairs, the education of her\\n      son, and the rehearsal of her numerous sensations. She had not been my\\n      patient long when her husband failed in business, so that the family was\\n      reduced from very comfortable circumstances to a condition which made it\\n      necessary for the patient to make her own living and that of the family.\\n      This she almost at once proceeded to do, setting aside all other\\n      considerations and establishing a boarding-house, where she did most of\\n      the work herself. This she has done now for ten or twelve years without a\\n      serious relapse. The time involved in the period of convalescence was\\n      scarcely more than three weeks, a although her work maybe said to have\\n      begun at the moment her resolution was taken.\\n      \\n Prognostics.-From these and other cases\\n      in and outside of the writer\\'s practice, it is safe to say that the\\n      majority of cases of neurasthenia recover, though years may elapse before\\n      that period. We learn, furthermore, that recoveries, especially of very\\n      inveterate cases, depend on conditions beyond the control of the\\n      physician, as was the case in the above-recorded instances, where\\n      circumstances forced the patient to cases to wish for recovery and to make\\n      an effort of the will. This having been once accomplished self-confidence,\\n      for a long time in abeyance, was permanently restored.\\n      \\n Curability, further, depends very much\\n      on the temperament of the patient, whether amiable, tractable and\\n      confiding in the honest endeavors of the physician, or whether refractory,\\n      suspicious, untruthful, selfish and antagonistic, of a disposition\\n      impossible to win over on account of unnatural distrust of every\\n      well-meaning person. The degree of intelligence of patients also has a\\n      pronounced influence on the result. The most readily curable cases are\\n      those acquired without hereditary predisposition, where the cause is found\\n      in the absence of food and sleep, also where sorrow and anxiety can be\\n      averted or counteracted by judicious conduct of near relatives and\\n      friends.\\n      \\n Dietetic Treatment.-This, as medicinal\\n      treatment, must be governed by the stage at which the case comes into the\\n      physician\\'s hands-whether yet in its prodromal, its acute or its chronic\\n      phase. The prodromal stage of the disease has no very decided\\n      pathognomonic signs. The most that can be recognized in this stage is that\\n      the patient\\'s habits or duties are of a kind which will eventually lead to\\n      obdurate neurasthenia if not arrested in time by removing the exciting\\n      causes. Too much pleasure, as well as too much care, especially in girls\\n      and woman, tends to neglect of food and rest, in the absence of which,\\n      excitements, whether of pleasure or care, begets a state of unrest in\\n      which repose is disagreeable. With such a condition comes a list of\\n      incipient casual complaints of headache, imperfect sleep, notional ways of\\n      eating, working or playing. A few questions will determine whether the\\n      patient is living according to normal or abnormal habits with regard to\\n      appetite, sleep and occupation. Where these are found, their alteration to\\n      normal ways must be instead on. It is unnecessary to say that this is\\n      easier said than done, for it will probably meet with serious objections\\n      on the part of the patient, if not on that of her relatives; for most\\n      likely she has examinations for college to prepare for, involving several\\n      months of dose and careful study at night, and the patient cannot waste\\n      time in sleeping and eating while cramming that little excited and\\n      ambitions brain. A failure in the examinations would be as much of a\\n      disappointment to parents as to patient, who proves, as usual, that this\\n      appellation is a misnomer. She accordingly goes in as she please, lied by\\n      an increasing morbidly ambitions impulse, and the result is likely to be\\n      the mournful satisfaction on the part of the physician of being obliged to\\n      say, \"I told you before what would happen.\" Of course, all\\n      regret the now evident nerve-prostration, while, if the doctor had\\n      succeeded in enforcing his rules, he would in many cases experience the\\n      still more painful reproach of having been too severe. Nevertheless,\\n      absolute firmness and a kindly but unflinching exertion of his will,\\n      without the least compromise, reward the physician with the best results\\n      in such cases.\\n      \\n When the case, after the stage of\\n      excitement and untiring restlessness (at which it would still be speedily\\n      curable by simple dietetic rules) has, after weeks or months, entered upon\\n      the phase of painful prostration, here we encounter backache, oppressive\\n      headache, and absolute loss of mental or bodily endurance, measures of\\n      dietetic management are much less effective and much more difficult to\\n      find. it is at this stage that slight rise of temperature will occur,\\n      especially towards evening; then the backache and headache disappear, the\\n      pallor is replaced by a flush of color, the eyes lose their listless look,\\n      and the patient is inclined to enter upon some diversion or excitement,\\n      followed by a restless night and a morning of exhaustion and a renewal of\\n      all painful sensations. Most of such patients feel much better in the\\n      evening when they are ready for some entertainment, while in a normal\\n      state this would be the time for relaxation and repose.\\n      \\n The dietetic treatment of this stage is\\n      methodical rest. In severe cases the patient will do well to remain in bed\\n      for several days or even for weeks. It is well to shorten this period as\\n      much as possible and to insist on walking about, or, at least. sitting for\\n      a specified time every day. This may be varied b equally specified periods\\n      of rest in the recumbent position.\\n      \\n Irregularities of eating are at this\\n      and at all times to be superseded by the most rigid regularity of meals.\\n      The traditional and conventional three-meal system, however well adapted\\n      to the needs of a vigorous man or woman, does not agree with the\\n      neurasthenic patient. It is much better that these should eat oftener;\\n      four times a day is best in most cases, for the simple reason that in this\\n      way a patient, while eating less at a time, consumes more food in the\\n      aggregate.\\n      \\n As neurasthenic patients are rarely\\n      troubled with absolute aversion to wholesome food, they are generally able\\n      to consume a liberal quantity, about which it is only needful to remark\\n      here that the food should be selected from among the articles and dishes\\n      which the patient likes, provided they belong to the order of good, normal\\n      articles of food, to the exclusion of those which simply please the taste\\n      without being digestible. A dish entirely of meat or \"animal\\n      food\" is as far from being a good diet for neurasthenics as one\\n      consisting entirely of \"vegetable\" food. As a rule, the diet\\n      list should comprise one-third of nitrogenous material and two-thirds of\\n      carbohydrates. Together with these, it is a great mistake to neglect the\\n      fats, such as good butter and the fats of meats. And, lastly, every\\n      patient of this kind should be made to drink some water often, a dietetic\\n      feature too often neglected.\\n      \\n During this stage, actually fatiguing\\n      exercise of body and mind should be avoided, while, on the other hand, the\\n      patient\\'s mind should be directed away from herself, in which she is much\\n      assisted by withholding a certain kind of emotional sympathy, quite as\\n      natural as it is difficult to repress on the part of affectionate persons.\\n      Of this, a few words further on.\\n      \\n There is no definite time for the\\n      duration of this stage, which, however, depends largely on the time during\\n      which the exciting causes have acted, either aided by or without a\\n      predisposition. It is certain, however, that the sooner it is recognized\\n      and the exciting causes eliminated, so much the sooner recovery will\\n      begin. But there is a stage at which the best of experience and judgment\\n      often fail, especially in very inveterate cases. If the case is one of a\\n      patient whom the physician has had opportunity of watching at least since\\n      the earlier stages, the difficulty is not so great as it is in old cases\\n      months or even of several years\\' duration which come to treatment late. In\\n      these, the line between the intermediate stage and incipient convalescence\\n      cannot be drawn. The patient is as neurasthenic and hypochondriacal as\\n      ever; cannot bear the slightest mental or bodily exertion, not even a word\\n      or a look, without sings of apparent exhaustion, while nearly the whole\\n      time is spent in bed under anxious care of sympathetic attendants. In such\\n      cases, having become assured, by careful physical examination, of the\\n      absence of organic disease, seeing the patient generally well nourished\\n      and in fair muscular condition, the physician is warranted in assuming\\n      that the disease has run its course, that whatever morbid (pathological)\\n      process there may have been progressing in the nervous system, this\\n      process has now come to and end, but it has left the patient\\'s mental\\n      condition habituated to the moods of the past months or years, and fixed,\\n      as it were, indelibly in the memory. It is the habit that now remains, not\\n      the disease.\\n      \\n If reasonably sure of this, and calling\\n      to mind the rapid recoveries and the circumstances attending them, as\\n      above detailed, the physician is now safe in ordering a more energetic\\n      treatment, calculated to rouse the self-reliance of the patient. All\\n      visible signs of sympathy must now be set aside; the actins and demeanor\\n      of the attendants should, from this time, if not before, be changed so as\\n      to give the patient the impression that she is no longer an invalid, but\\n      expected to rely on her own exertion. Instead of being fed, the food\\n      should be placed where she must go for and eat it. She should now be\\n      expected to dress and attend, without assistance, to her natural wants.\\n      This, with some temperaments, is almost impossible, with al extremely\\n      difficult. The best course to pursue is to remove such patients from\\n      sympathetic relatives or friends, and to place them in charge of kind,\\n      reliable, but eminently practical nurses.\\n      \\n The first effect of this is either to\\n      throw the patient into a stage of helpless despondency, which, again\\n      appealing powerfully to the sympathies of those nearest to her, often\\n      frustrates the physician\\'s plans which, if firmly but kindly adhered to,\\n      would, ere long, prove of their superiority by signs of returning\\n      self-reliance and absence of complaints on the part of the patient. A\\n      second form of effect is that occurring in patients of obstreperous,\\n      selfish disposition, whose opposition and even anger is aroused by being\\n      thrown on their own resources after the removal of depressing and\\n      unpractical sympathy. This opposition or temper, often manifested in all\\n      sorts of intrigues and subterfuges on the part of the patient, if not\\n      supinely yielded to by sympathetic persons, will finally be replaced by a\\n      more rational disposition. On the whole, anger or active opposition are\\n      signs of returning energy, which, once coming to the consciousness of the\\n      patient, takes the form of self- reliance. it is this way that the cures\\n      of chronic cases above related can be explained, and physicians should\\n      profit by such experience for the benefit of their patients.\\n      \\n The general dietetic management now\\n      readily follows from what has been said, and needs only a few general\\n      modifications. The first duty of the physician will be to test the degree\\n      of reliance to be placed on the patient and her friends, ad to win them\\n      over if possible to his plans, and his success will be in proportion to\\n      the degree of confidence he is able to inspire. This personal confidence\\n      should not degenerate into a mere personal liking or attachment of a\\n      sympathy-craving neurasthenic who should discover henceforth that all\\n      sentimental expressing of sympathy are about to take a practical form,\\n      aiming at a definite result-the patient\\'s health-which she wishes but\\n      cannot exert her will to attain. The best and often the only way to do\\n      away with sentiment and to reach practical kindness is to remove the\\n      patient from certain home influence, and to place her in a hospital or\\n      elsewhere under the management of competent nurses who, without being\\n      selfish, know how to exert a certain amount of wholesome push as fast as\\n      the patient can bear it. Without the removal of sentimental sympathy, all\\n      efforts at counteracting the purely hypochondriacal side of neurasthenia\\n      are useless.\\n      \\n In these cases of neurasthenia as yet\\n      uncomplicated with the hypochondriacal element of introspective nosomania,\\n      there is only one unconditional rule to be followed, especially in\\n      acquired cases whose evident cause was incessant, conscientious work of\\n      mind and body, together with insufficient food and sleep. Such cases come\\n      on very insidiously, the loss of strength-that is, the actual waste of\\n      nerve-substance-being just a trifle grater than the quantity restored, the\\n      patient unconsciously using up a minute part of her capital every day.\\n      Here the rule should be to reverse matters to insuring a supply of\\n      nourishment and time for its assimilation greater than was the case\\n      heretofore. The case of young school-girls belong in this class. The time\\n      of food and rest should be carefully controlled at home, the duty of the\\n      physician being to educate indifferent and ignorant parents up to an\\n      appreciation of the nature of the case. It is generally not difficult to\\n      open their eyes through the medium of their anxiety concerning their\\n      children\\'s health. Having thus insured sufficient rest and food at home,\\n      the physician\\'s next object of attention should be the regulations of the\\n      school. Here is the point where teachers have an opportunity of exerting\\n      their most practical influence. It should be made obligatory on the part\\n      of teachers to institute inquiry as to whether pupils have had their meals\\n      before coming to school. This they could often ascertain without a\\n      question, by reading the pupil\\'s condition in her emaciated form, pale\\n      face and nervous manner. To guard against neglect at home, it would be an\\n      easy matter to insist that all pupils of public and private schools should\\n      bring with them some proper food. The few who do so generally bring\\n      sweets-an apple, orange or a few dry crackers-when a piece of good bread\\n      and slice of cold meat would be what they actually need. All pupils should\\n      pass inspection, and if remiss in this important particular, the\\n      delinquent should be dismissed with several marks against her. To expect\\n      this of teachers would be a great advance in the place of futile\\n      innovations of endeavoring to send forth from our common schools graduates\\n      in arts and sciences.\\n      \\n Sudden Effects.-A large number of cases\\n      of neurasthenia, especially those complicated with inveterate\\n      Hypochondriasis, are frequently traced to some sudden occurrence, having\\n      the effect of a mental or physical shock. In one patient, a vigorous girl,\\n      used to romping, climbing and running lie a boy, the cause was supposed to\\n      be a slight thump she received during a game of blindman\\'s-buff. She\\n      thought nothing of it at the time, but it was suggested long after the\\n      patient\\'s illness began. In another case some mental shock of joy or\\n      grief, not very severe and such as is often experienced in every person\\'s\\n      life, is the beginning of months of nervous prostration.\\n      \\n There is quite an array of evidence\\n      that neurasthenia which has entered upon a hypochondriacal stage or\\n      complication with or without a strong hysterical admixture, is curable by\\n      sudden impressions in the form of a shock, or more gradually by frequent\\n      repetitions of an impression. Such cases, as I have shown above, occur\\n      most commonly in the stage when what may be considered the essential\\n      pathological disturbances of function have run their course and have left\\n      the patient in a state of mental disturbance which indicated that the\\n      patient\\'s recovery depends entirely upon her volition. But there is none,\\n      and so far nothing has succeeded in arousing it. Persuasion is as useless\\n      and irritating, as argument would be in a case of insanity with a fixed\\n      illusion. The resemblance between this and the state of mind of a\\n      hypochondriacal neurasthenic is very close. She cannot move nor thick.\\n      Exhaustion overcomes her and keeps her its victim for years, when suddenly\\n      the scene changes, and a few days or weeks suffice to restore the patient\\n      to activity. In one instance it is attributed to medical, in another to\\n      \"mind cure,\" in a third to \"Christian science;\" in\\n      still other cases massage has done it, in others again \"magnetic\\n      influence,\" in others the very powerful factor necessity. It is\\n      certain that cases of this kind, produced by sudden effects on the mind of\\n      a predisposed person, are also cured by such effects. Whatever the visible\\n      form of these effects may be -whether that of \"Christian\\n      science,\" joy, grief or absolute inexorable necessity, there is\\n      always to be noticed a certain force and condition involving the modern\\n      idea of suggestion, which comes to the patient in an irresistible degree\\n      and now sets the function of the will in motion again.\\n      \\n Experience teaches that it is by no\\n      means a matter of indifference which of these forms of effect are brought\\n      into action. In one case it is the professional Christian scientist\\'s\\n      method, in another the almost brutal exertion of a person\\'s will combined\\n      with some physical force. In either case the patient is aroused from his\\n      inertia, and discovers his powers of mental and bodily ability to act.\\n      \\n A deplorable result is that recoveries\\n      after such effects are attributed in the popular mind to supernatural\\n      causes. That such is not the case may be gathered form instances occurring\\n      in very sensible and intelligent patients, whose reason is scarcely ever\\n      so far disturbed and weakened that they do not resent the proposition of\\n      trying, e.g., Christian science or mind cure.\\n      \\n Nevertheless, it is the mind cure which\\n      the intelligent patient needs quite as much as the ignorant and\\n      superstitious person; the difference is only the form in which the\\n      influencing force is applied. While in one case it is obedience to the\\n      candidly expressed instructions of the physician, in the other case the\\n      result is the to mystification. In either case it is the powerful stimulus\\n      of hope and aroused confidence that recovery will be realized.\\n      \\n The definition of suggestion does not\\n      fully cover the meaning, because the influence employed is greater than\\n      mere suggestion. The physician\\'s plan of action should be straightforward\\n      assurance of recovery, a direct appeal to hope, and an unceasing endeavor\\n      to arouse the self-reliance of the patient, not so much by verbal\\n      exhortations as by a manner and department from which the patient learns\\n      more readily than from words what is expected. If the attitude of the\\n      physician is appreciated, and seconded by the relatives and attendants, a\\n      favorable result is much more certain to follow.\\n      \\n Hypnotism is not advisable. There are\\n      now existing ancient neurasthenic invalids dating from the times of\\n      spiritualism when they were famous \"mediums.\" Hypnotism weakness\\n      the will and nervous endurance, and produces a predisposition to emotional\\n      nervousness with an intractable erotic admixture. The suggestions sought\\n      to be instilled into a hypnotized patient amount to nothing. The mental\\n      influence of mystical treatment administered while the patients is awake\\n      is much more powerful in awaking hope and confidence than the uncertain\\n      effects of an abnormal state like that of hypnotism. Mystification, again,\\n      though sometimes unavoidable with the best intention, is less powerful\\n      than direct and intelligible encouragement. While resort to mystification\\n      should be shunned by reputable physicians, the question arises as to what\\n      shall be done with the many who, from lack of intelligence or education,\\n      are entirely beyond the reach of honest common sense, and who will persist\\n      in mystifying themselves, who remain neurasthenic invalids in spite of the\\n      best regulations of the physician, and who do not recover unless their\\n      encouragement follows some mystical formalities which alone arouse their\\n      \"faith\" and finally their confidence and will-power. For the\\n      present there is no way out of the dilemma but to submit such patients to\\n      the suggestive methods of what is popularly known as mind cure and\\n      Christian science. In doing so, physicians should use their influence as\\n      far as possible in selecting the most honest persons of this class.\\n      \\n DISCUSSION.\\n      \\n JAMES C. WOOD, M.D.: I have nothing but\\n      words of praise for Dr. Wesselhoeft\\'s excellent paper. It is very evident\\n      that the author\\'s inspiration came not from books but from actual contact\\n      with neurasthenic subjects, for the impress of originality is most\\n      conspicuous. It is a production which could only come from one of\\n      experience and from a reasoner. I consider it a most valuable contribution\\n      to the literature of that now most interesting subject,\\n      \"neurasthenia\".\\n      \\n The doctor, in his paper, has sometimes\\n      used the term \"neurasthenia\" instead of\\n      \"neurasthenia.\" The first of these means, according to Thomas,\\n      great nervous power or excitement; the second, nervous debility. I taken\\n      it from the context that the subject dealt with is neurasthenia. To the\\n      average mind there exists what seems to me a needless confusion regarding\\n      the terms, nervous prostration, hysteria and hystero-neurosis. As I\\n      understand these terms they define distinct conditions, though there is a\\n      frequent blending the one with the other. The term nervous prostration,\\n      which is a synonym of neurasthenia, defines itself; the term hysteria\\n      should be restricted to those general neuroses characterized particularly\\n      by psychical manifestations, though not infrequently by motor, sensory,\\n      secretory, vasomotor and reflex derangements as well; while the term\\n      hysteroneurosis implies the uterine origin of symptoms manifesting\\n      themselves in organs remote from the uterus without structural changes in\\n      such organs, being the direct result of reflex nervous influence starting\\n      from the uterus. The last term does not occur in the paper under\\n      discussion. From the standpoint of a gynecologist I think that this is\\n      misleading.\\n      \\n Let us see why and how it is that these\\n      three conditions (I will not call them diseases) are so frequently\\n      associated. I think that all will admit the frequent occurrence in woman\\n      of reflex symptoms, the result of pelvic lesions. An irritation staring\\n      form the pelvis is conveyed to the genito-spinal centre, thence to any or\\n      all organs with which this centre communicates. The organ oftener involved\\n      than any other is the stomach. This is shown by the frequent occurrence of\\n      nausea and vomiting following conception. The nervous system may have been\\n      previously involved, but oftener it becomes so only after the nutrition is\\n      depraved, which, sooner or later, occurs if the pelvic lesion is not\\n      removed. The depraved blood fails to supply the nerve centres with that\\n      which they need to sustain them, and they become anaemic. Prostration is\\n      but a subjective manifestation of the anaemia, and it varies in degree\\n      from a slight indisposition to the most abject helplessness.\\n      \\n If, then, nervous prostration may have\\n      its beginning in a pelvic lesion, is it possible for a pelvic lesion to be\\n      inaugurated by systemic disturbances? Personally, I believe that it is,\\n      and offer this explanation as the modus operandi by which such a lesion is\\n      induced: Marked circulatory changes nearly always attend nervous\\n      prostration. The circulation is presided over by the vaso-motor system,\\n      and wear and repair depend upon the proper regulation of this system. If\\n      it becomes disturbed, the bloodvessels dilate or contract unduly, with\\n      resulting local hyperaemia or local anaemia, as the case maybe. The\\n      climacteric flushes are the result of such disturbance. The alternate\\n      coldness and heat of the extremities, so often associated with rectal and\\n      uterine lesions, is another familiar illustration. If the brain is\\n      involved, either insomnia or drowsiness occur, depending upon whether the\\n      brain is anaemic or hyperaemic. Flatulence, gastralgia, and nervous\\n      dyspepsia result when the stomach is similarly affected. The womb and the\\n      ovaries, because of the periodical congestion imposed upon them, are\\n      oftener implicated by these unnatural circulatory disturbances than any of\\n      the pelvic organs, and in time also become unduly hyperaemic or anaemic,\\n      as the case may be.\\n      \\n It will thus be seen that nervous\\n      prostration may exist independently of pelvic lesions, or, conversely,\\n      pelvic lesions may exist independently of nervous prostration.\\n      Nevertheless, the two are frequently associated, and this fact ought, I\\n      believe, to be kept in mind in dealing with the affection known as\\n      neurasthenia. Hysterical manifestations nearly always come to the surface\\n      in nervous prostration, and they also frequently attend pelvic lesions.\\n      Indeed, the term \"hystero-psychosis\" has been coined for the\\n      purpose of defining certain psychical disturbances of presumably pelvic\\n      origin, and in the broadest sense neurasthenia is not uncommonly an\\n      hysteroneurosis. It is the frequent association of these three conditions\\n      which, it seems to me, makes it more practicable to study them conjointly.\\n      \\n The special symptoms of nervous\\n      prostration are most variable. Introspection, as Dr. Wesselhoeft has\\n      pointed out, makes of the patient a nosomaniac. The anaemic nerve centres\\n      are unduly impressionable, and a mental shock which would not seriously\\n      affect a stronger and more rugged woman falls with crushing force upon one\\n      whose nutrition is already depraved. In this way are developed disorders\\n      of sensibility, alternations of mobility, circulatory disturbances,\\n      anomalies of secretion and exertion, disorders of the gastro-intestinal\\n      canal, dermatoses, and general and psychical disturbances of all kinds.\\n      Many of these affections start from pelvic lesions, and are nearly always\\n      associated with depravity of nutrition and more or less nervous\\n      prostration.\\n      \\n Some of the worst symptoms of\\n      neurasthenia with which I have had to contend have been hyperaesthesia of\\n      the articulations, giving rise to the so-called \"hysterical\\n      joint.\" Here the prostration is usually not profound, and it is\\n      possible to apply the somewhat energetic treatment recommended by Dr.\\n      Wesselhoeft. I remember one case very distinctly, the detailed history of\\n      which I shall give in another place, which brought me much reputation\\n      because of the \"remarkable\" cure I was fortunate enough to make.\\n      \\n The patient, a beautiful girl of\\n      eighteen, had been bed- ridden for three years with supposed hip-joint\\n      disease. She was in college before assuming the ride of an invalid, and\\n      worried much over her studies and work. She sustained a fall a short time\\n      previously to taking to her bed, and to this fall the injury to the hip\\n      was attributed. She had been from physician to physician and from\\n      sanitarium to sanitarium without receiving benefit. All of the numerous\\n      medical men under whose care she had been, directed their attention to the\\n      hip and applied the classical treatment for morbus coxarius without avail.\\n      The patient had finally reached a point where introspection was her chief\\n      occupation and her mind dwelt almost continually upon a \"diseased\\n      hip.\" She was finally brought to me, coming in an invalid\\'s chair and\\n      looking the very picture of dependency. There was a slight degree of\\n      anaemia, though this was not marked. Notwithstanding the expression\\n      expression of abjectness the girl did not look seriously ill. The hip was\\n      excessively tender upon pressure, but there was no local increase of\\n      temperature, no evidences of fever and suppuration, and forcible\\n      apposition by striking the heel was not very painful. More less spastic\\n      contraction of the flexor muscles of the affected side existed, which gave\\n      to the limb an appearance of actual shortening, which was very deceptive.\\n      Hysterical symptoms were common. On examination I found the left ovary\\n      exquisitely tender. Compression of the ovary increased the pain in the hip\\n      most decidedly and gave rise to much nervous agitation. I did not,\\n      therefore, deem it wise to recommend local treatment other than the daily\\n      use of the hot douche. She had long been a victim of ovarian\\n      dysmenorrhoea. I placed upon the ankle of the affected limb three pounds\\n      of bar-lead, prescribed a pair of crutches and insisted upon her walking.\\n      The lead was used to overcome the spastic contraction as well as for its\\n      moral effect. I did not deem the joint lesion of such a character as to\\n      used extension. In two months\\' time this patient discarded her crutches\\n      for a cane. Six weeks later she put up the cane and is now perfectly well.\\n      \\n This was a case in which somewhat harsh\\n      measures were eminently appropriate.\\n      \\n In marked contrast to the case just\\n      recorded is the following: Mrs.-, aet. 47, widow for twenty years. She is\\n      a devoted church-woman, and for years was a leader in all charitable work\\n      done in the community in which she resided. Through friends she was urged\\n      to consult me, and I think that the call to the neighboring town in which\\n      she lived was countermanded at least four or five times before the finally\\n      mustered up courage and strength enough to see me. Upon reaching the\\n      bedside I found my patient in a room made dark by closed blinds, over\\n      which were hung heavy blankets to shut out every ray of light. The mirror\\n      was turned toward the wall for fear a ray of light might strike it and\\n      flesh throughout the darkened room. Nor did the patient rest under these\\n      extreme precautions, for the eyes were protected with two pairs of colored\\n      glasses with side attachments. Hyperaesthesia of the sense of hearing was\\n      equally marked and the noise was excluded from the room by double doors\\n      whose keyholes were stuffed with cotton. She l so had her ears filled with\\n      cotton, over which she wore ear-mufflers. She was emaciated to an extreme\\n      degree, and had been reduced to her miserable condition by a series of\\n      events which frequently precede profound neurasthenia. Her husband was\\n      killed during the war, and she was left childless. Twelve months previous\\n      to taking to her bed she nursed her mother through a long and fatal\\n      illness. This greatly prostrated her, yet she kept up until a favorite\\n      brother-in-law was thrown from a carriage and killed. This was the last\\n      straw, and the shock compelled her to take to her bed. In due time loss of\\n      appetite with irritability of the stomach developed, which, of course, led\\n      to marked depravity of nutrition. With the anaemia came hyperaesthesia of\\n      the special senses, spinal irritation, headache, hysterical\\n      manifestations, etc. There was no series pelvic lesion, although she had\\n      been much treated for an alleged uterine displacement with congestion.\\n      Unfortunately, she was encouraged, instead of discouraged, in her\\n      invalidism, and she soon became a nosomaniac of the worst type. She had\\n      written down her symptoms one at a time, and the record is such a typical\\n      one that I should like to give it in full, but time forbids.\\n      \\n With great difficulty the patient was\\n      moved on a cough to a private hospital and placed under the Weir Mitchell\\n      treatment. I ignored the pelvic trouble entirely. It is unnecessary to\\n      give in detail the progress of the case from day to day after this\\n      treatment was inaugurated. Suffice it to say that the improvement was of\\n      the most marked character, and in six weeks from the time she entered the\\n      hospital she walked to her carriage with her eyes and ears unprotected.\\n      She soon resumed her church and charitable work, in which she again takes\\n      much delight.\\n      \\n This woman wanted to get well. She was\\n      a woman of pure motives and high ideals. She had, in the language of Dr.\\n      Wesselhoeft, the wish, but, unaided, not the will. She required the aid of\\n      an intelligent, strong-minded, nurse who could bring to her exercise\\n      applied in such a way as to enable her to assimilate food without the\\n      expenditure of nerve force. She co- operated with her physician and nurse\\n      in every possible way, and as soon as the anaemic nerve cells became\\n      flushed with new blood she began to improve. To have commanded this\\n      patient \"to take up her bed and walk\" before improving her\\n      nutrition would have been as unscientific as to have placed the first\\n      patient in bed with extension and counter-extension applied to the limb. I\\n      know of no class of cases requiring for their successful treatment more\\n      tact and discrimination than that under consideration.\\n      \\n I feel confident that I have many times\\n      cut the affection short in its prodromal stage by removing the girl from\\n      college work and insisting upon open-air exercise. Static electricity has,\\n      in my hands, proved exceedingly useful both during the prodromal stage and\\n      that of convalescence.\\n      \\n I will conclude by saying that I have\\n      been impressed with the frequency with which an hereditary history of\\n      epilepsy has been met with in the cases of neurasthenia passing under my\\n      observation.'\n",
      " 'Tresorie - SOME OF THE DISEASES PREVENTING AND COMPLICATION PREGNANCY\\n[Diseases Preventing & Complicating Pregnancy]\\n\\n STERILITY.-DeSinety, Treub, Furbinger,\\n      et al., attribute 50 per cent. of unproductive marriages to the husbands,\\n      saying that sterility in the male is more often the cause of barren\\n      marriages than is generally supposed.\\n      \\n This cause of sterility I pass by, as\\n      also sterility due to mechanical obstruction, incomplete ovulation and the\\n      numerous other causes of this condition, too manifold for mere\\n      enumeration, to consider obesity as a causative agent in this condition. I\\n      need not say that the advocates for surgical interference for the relief\\n      of this condition are legion. Sims makes the assertion that sterility can\\n      be cured by surgical means only. That, of course, is Allopathic arguing\\n      pure and simple. Cases requiring surgical interference do arise, but any\\n      treatment which raises the nutrition of the entire organism, improves the\\n      blood-formation, and favors the resorption of pathological products in the\\n      sexual organs, is to be regarded as the indicated remedy.\\n      \\n Published statements are my authority\\n      for saying that excellent results have followed the administration of\\n      drugs, nevertheless; and in complete defiance of all therapeutic measures,\\n      a certain percentage of women remain barren; for with the more occult\\n      causes of sterility we remain, as yet, unacquainted, consequently they\\n      cannot all be reached with say kind of treatment whatever.\\n      \\n The following case I report somewhat in\\n      detail. Whilst not an exceptional case at all, it bears directly upon the\\n      subject under consideration, and possesses, it seems to me, some decidedly\\n      interesting features. My object in selecting this particular one is to\\n      call attention, if possible, to a condition not sufficiently considered.\\n      Mrs. J., aet. 26, married about two years and a half, appealed to my\\n      knowledge for a reason as to why she remained childless. The lady was\\n      carrying an excess of flesh, being under the medium height, and weighing\\n      186 pounds, but appeared to be in good health; family and previous history\\n      all that could be desired. Examination showed none of the common causes of\\n      sterility; neither, so far as I could ascertain, was the husband\\n      responsible for this unproductive condition of affairs. Some previous\\n      experiences of my own, with the added testimony of other and able men, was\\n      my reason for charging this condition of things to the excess of flesh,\\n      this, by the husband, being laughingly charged to excess of laziness.\\n      \\n We all, undoubtedly, are familiar with\\n      that peculiar disease of the blood-corpuscles which, whilst producing\\n      flesh, relaxes at the same time the muscular force; acting also, I\\n      believe, upon the muscular fibres of the uterus and upon the ovaries,\\n      inducing not only serious menstrual disorders but sterility. McKee,\\n      Philbert, and others give several instances of sterility chargeable to\\n      obesity, the women in question having been married several years without\\n      bearing children, and all became mothers after losing a portion of their\\n      flesh. If any other argument were needed in support of this theory we\\n      might turn to the quadrupeds, where we find the poorest breeders among the\\n      fleshiest animals. Fournel has a very able treatise on \"The Effects\\n      of Obesity on the Menstrual Functions and Parturition.\" Without\\n      having had any actual case of this description to deal with, he inclines\\n      very strongly towards the belief that obesity favors sterility. In the\\n      treatment of the case before mentioned, the patient was subjected to a\\n      daily massage of the entire body, with a special pelvic massage three\\n      times a week. This, in the main, consists in elevating the uterus as high\\n      as possible with the finger in the vagina, ending with a quick and decided\\n      vibratory motion. The diet received particular attention, as at this time\\n      there was a slight gastric ailment. The indicated remedy, Thuja, was given\\n      in the minimum dose. At the end of three months almost thirty pounds of\\n      flesh was gone, a considerable reduction. As an experiment, I recommended\\n      coitus in the knee-elbow position, advising that the lady remain quiet as\\n      long as possible after coition, with thighs well flexed. She became\\n      enciente, but miscarried at eight weeks. There was, comparatively\\n      speaking, but little pain and not much subsequent haemorrhage. She made a\\n      rapid recovery. Since then a living child has been born to them.\\n      \\n I believe I am safe in saying that this\\n      result would hardly have obtained were it not for the prophylactic\\n      measures adopted.\\n      \\n At the end of the first two months the\\n      patient was attacked with haemorrhage. A similar occurrence took place at\\n      irregular intervals during the following five months, the quantity of\\n      blood lost being much greater than that at the normal menstrual period.\\n      \\n For the greater part of the last five\\n      months she kept her bed, at the end of which time the tendency of the\\n      uterus to empty itself could be resisted no longer. A seven months\\' child\\n      was born, and is to-day doing well.\\n      \\n Pseudocyesis cerebral pregnancy,\\n      phantom pregnancy (whatever name we may call it by) is a disease which\\n      must come under the head of those \"complicating pregnancy.\" Mrs.\\n      M., a lady, married two or three years, aet. 29. Previous history good,\\n      always enjoying perfect health. When I first saw the lady in question she\\n      was a perfect picture of health, and, according to appearance and her own\\n      statements, about seven months pregnant. I made no examination. This\\n      appeared to be a thoroughly intelligent woman, and, according to her own\\n      statement, there was cessation of the menses. There certainly was an\\n      enlargement of the abdomen and breasts, a milky secretion, and the lady\\n      was sure that she felt foetal movement. On February 28th of the present\\n      year I was called to attend her in labor. Examination showed that no\\n      pregnancy existed. So far as I could ascertain there was no assignable\\n      origin for this condition other than nervous influences, the phenomena\\n      being purely muscular distension of the abdomen.\\n      \\n Mayham reports a case of a woman 73\\n      years old, claiming to be pregnant; he also claims that subsequently she\\n      was delivered of a child; this is an Allopathic report, however, of which\\n      we will take a Homoeopathic dose. Haultain reports three cases of cerebral\\n      pregnancy. In the first, he says no cause whatever was to be found; in the\\n      second, there was a small fibroid growth in the anterior uterine wall.\\n      Hauck reports a case where the vomiting, peristalsis, and flatus, caused\\n      by alcoholism were supposed to be caused by the pregnant state. Such cases\\n      are uncommon, but they emphasize the importance of making a thorough\\n      examination, in all cases where positive information is desired of the\\n      existence or non-existence of pregnancy.\\n      \\n Hyperemesis Gravidarum.-An animated\\n      discussion, held recently between two celebrated Allopaths of Stuttgart\\n      and Leipsic, has served to awaken a renewed interest in this subject,\\n      without in the least adding anything new to our stock of knowledge\\n      regarding its aetiology. Notwithstanding the frequency of the vomiting of\\n      pregnancy, its very distressing character in many instances, and its\\n      imminent, its very distressing character in many instances, and its\\n      imminent danger, we find but very few contributions of any value, to\\n      either the aetiology of the disorder or its therapeutics. I do not expect\\n      to add anything specially new myself, but it does seem to me that our\\n      knowledge of the vomiting of pregnancy, is to say the least, in a most\\n      contradictory state. Some physicians look upon it as a trifling matter,\\n      others as a thing to be endured, and some-these are in the right too-view\\n      even the mildest cases with gravity. Even in the mildest cases of morning\\n      sickness there is a constant drain upon the nervous system, putting the\\n      sufferer into a condition, in which she is very much less able to endure\\n      parturition than she would otherwise have been.\\n      \\n Dr. Harrison Mettler says: \"After\\n      careful inquiry I find that women who suffer from much morning sickness\\n      have as a rule, tedious or otherwise troublesome labors. I have observed\\n      in multiparae that at one time they will have much nausea and vomiting\\n      followed by a difficult labor, while at another time they will be quite\\n      free from the vomiting, and will pass through the succeeding labor with\\n      comparative ease.\" I must say my observations make me agree with Dr.\\n      Mettler entirely; when one thinks how rapidly the mildest of cases assume\\n      pernicious forms, indifference is certainly no longer to be excused. There\\n      is a voluminous literature upon this subject, and many and varied are the\\n      aetiological reasons given for this very variable affection, a large\\n      majority of writers coinciding in the opinion that \"many causes\\n      operate together,\" to produce what we are pleased to designate the\\n      \"vomiting of pregnancy.\" I believe myself that in a large\\n      percentage of cases, this pernicious vomiting is simply the result of a\\n      reflex neurosis. Undoubtedly uterine displacements frequently cause\\n      vomiting; but when this is so, and the displaced organ is raised by\\n      packing the vagina with aseptic wool, the vomiting ceases.\\n      \\n Lillie reports a number of cases, where\\n      obstinate vomiting was caused by a retroflexed uterus, and restoration of\\n      the organ caused a cessation of the disorder. Bezugloff having a\\n      persistent case of morning sickness, introduced a bougie it no the uterus,\\n      the intention being to produce abortion; the immediate result was a\\n      stoppage of the vomiting, and the pregnancy went on to full term.\\n      \\n In the case just cited, I must say that\\n      I believe it was the fright, caused by the thought of abortion being\\n      performed, more than the effects of introducing the bougie, which operated\\n      so successfully; I say now, as I said before, I believe that the\\n      pre-eminent cause of this kind of sickness must be looked for i the\\n      nervous system. Flint speaks of this form of sickness as being decidedly\\n      neurotic in its origin, and cites a number of cases of a chronic variety\\n      of dyspepsia frequently occurring in young girls. I had one such case come\\n      under my personal care. There was a persistent morning sickness, with this\\n      young lady, and a disagreeable nausea whenever food was taken; this\\n      patient was at some distance from her home, in a boarding school, and she\\n      will probably never know that the lady principal entertained very grave\\n      thoughts at one time in regard to her virtue. It certainly was very\\n      difficult to differentiate between this and the vomiting of pregnancy; it\\n      was, however, simply due to a vitiated nervous system. My theory is\\n      supported by Alt, who records a number of such cases; I cite one only, the\\n      case being that of a highly hysterical woman, six months pregnant,\\n      suffering from the gravest vomiting, and anxious that miscarriage be\\n      induced. She was making preparation for entering the hospital for this\\n      purpose, when one of her children was seized with pneumonia. The anxiety\\n      felt over the child, forced all thought of self from the mother\\'s mind;\\n      from that moment the vomiting ceased and she remained well until the\\n      termination of pregnancy.-Minchener Medicinische Wochenschrift.\\n      \\n Whilst saying that I believe this\\n      disease to be in the majority of cases of purely nervous origin, I would\\n      not imply thereby that it is not to be feared, far from it; if neglected,\\n      we know how likely it is to pass quickly beyond treatment and our patient\\n      succumb from sheer exhaustion.\\n      \\n In the treatment cited such as\\n      insertion of bougies, dilation of the os, pelvic massage, etc., I believe\\n      it is merely the \"doing something,\" no matter much what it is,\\n      so long as you have gained the confidence of your patient, that does good.\\n      We have seen how suddenly Hyperemesis will cease if the patient be\\n      alarmed; it may be, has often been, and will to again, cured by a process\\n      skin to suggestion. Kattenback had a case where the patient, a primipara,\\n      was seized with an incorrigible vomiting. It was suggested to her that her\\n      stomach contained some lumps of unwholesome material and their removal\\n      would cure her. Some milk was given her, and the stomach ceremoniously\\n      washed out. its contents bore no indications of either over-acidity or\\n      abnormal ferment She was informed that she was all right and the vomiting\\n      would not return; neither did if, and she was safely delivered at term.\\n      \\n There is a familiar and now well-know\\n      phenomena, by which these neurotics can be influenced; I speak of\\n      hypnotism; it is due to purely subjective conditions.\\n      \\n There is an identity of the hypnotic\\n      susceptibility with the condition of hysteria, and it is along these lines\\n      that we can work. Just as many times as I have tried this method of\\n      treatment, for these cases of excessive vomiting, just so many times has\\n      it given me gratifying results.\\n      \\n The patient can be to sleep by\\n      bi-ocular pressure, and the idea of cure suggested; the operation may have\\n      to be repeated several times, at intervals of a day or so, but you will be\\n      rewarded by the cessation of the vomiting, often with but one suggestion.\\n      Where the patient is not easily controlled by means of the bi-ocular\\n      pressure, Luy\\'s revolving mirror is a never failing resource.'\n",
      " 'Tresorie - PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS [Presidential Address]\\n\\n THE ROLE OF HOMOEOPATHY IN THE SECOND\\n      \\n By ALVA BENJAMIN, M.B.CH.B., F.F.HOM.\\n      \\n Such a system of medicine must\\n      recognize that it is as much an art as a science, and that healing is a\\n      relationship between two living personalities. It must recognize too, that\\n      the sick individual has to take an active part in his treatment and not be\\n      merely the passive recipient of this or that treatment. For just as it is\\n      rightly said that man does not live by alone, so should it be emphasized\\n      that man cannot be cured by medicine alone. He must see to it himself that\\n      he lives as far as possible a physically and psychically healthy life.\\n      Indeed, each individual has a power within himself to help in his own\\n      cure.\\n      \\n Do the official schools of medicine\\n      teach such an art today? I am afraid not: they are so intent on seeking\\n      the specific treatment for this or that named disease or the antibiotic\\n      that will most effectively put out of action the organism regarded as the\\n      cause of the disease, that they are losing sight of the individual\\n      himself.\\n      \\n But Homoeopathy in its persistent\\n      search for the reactions of the individual to his environment in the\\n      broadest sense, no matter of what the patient is complaining surely\\n      fulfills these requirements, especially when it is recognized that the\\n      homoeopathic potencies do not anything to the patient as do the drugs of\\n      the dominant school, but rather stimulate the patients own recuperative\\n      powers to overcome the infection or re - establish the normal metabolism\\n      which has become deranged by the illness.\\n      \\n When you consider how the homoeopathic\\n      physician diagnoses the individuality of his patient over and above the\\n      name of the disease from which he is suffering, and uses for the purpose\\n      of his prescription rather than the name of the disease this personal\\n      diagnosis of the patients mental and emotional reactions, his responses to\\n      changes in weather conditions, the alternations in his environment which\\n      influence his symptoms, etc., one realize how very individualistic is the\\n      Homoeopathic prescription fitted to that particular patient.\\n      \\n The homoeopathic physician does not\\n      seek for a remedy specific to any named disease and which he can thus\\n      apply almost automatically once he has made his organic diagnosis, which\\n      in quite an appreciable number of instances may ultimately be found to be\\n      wrong and so the treatment based upon it must therefore have been wrong.\\n      He does not, as is so often done, merely suppress the most outstanding\\n      symptom by an appropriate drug; for example giving an anodyne to mask the\\n      pain or removing the skin eruption by some strong local application, in\\n      other words putting the dust under the mat and pretending the room is\\n      clean.\\n      \\n Strangely enough the homoeopathic\\n      physician is often accused by his allopathic critic in his ignorance of\\n      Homoeopathy, of merely treating symptoms, whereas it is the critic himself\\n      who practices this superficial medicine. The homoeopathic physician, on\\n      the other hand, treats his patient as a whole through his symptoms and\\n      their modifications through changes in the environment, which is quite a\\n      different matter.\\n      \\n Homoeopathic therapy, unlike methods of\\n      treatment, is based on a natural law \"Similia Similibus\\n      Curentur\" \"Likes may be cured by likes\" which has been\\n      proved time and time again by experiment and which anyone with the will to\\n      do may prove for himself. It is not subject to constant change brought\\n      about by this or that latest discovery, and which itself will soon have to\\n      give way to the still later idea.\\n      \\n Having now introduced to you our actor,\\n      what of the scene in which he is to play his role?\\n      \\n This is the nineteen hundred and fifty\\n      - fourth year of the Christian era and the second year of the reign of our\\n      much loved and admired young Queen Elizabeth II, who will remember while\\n      in south Africa on her twenty - first birthday, before she had any idea\\n      that she would so soon be called to such an exalted position as she holds\\n      today, broadcast to the commonwealth and Empire her resolve to dedicate\\n      her life to the service of this grand community which dedication she\\n      recently repeated at her Coronation.\\n      \\n Here in Great Britain we have a more or\\n      less complete welfare state, with which idea some of us may very strongly\\n      disagree, whilst others believe such a development is the result of a\\n      natural very desirable social evolution.\\n      \\n As one necessary ingredient of this\\n      welfare state came, in 1948, the initiation of the National Health\\n      Service, through which the great majority of the population receives its\\n      medical attention, although it is rightly available to all.\\n      \\n When we come to consider the role that\\n      homoeo - therapeutics should play in this scheme, I would suggest that we\\n      should regard the problem from the purely medical aspect, forgetting any\\n      political party allegiances or sympathies we may have; or if we cannot\\n      forget them we should remember that the organization of the National\\n      Insurance Scheme of which the National Health Service is but a part, was\\n      first blue printed by the well - known Liberal supporter, Lord Beveridge,\\n      and the Health Service plans developed by the Coalition Government of all\\n      three major political parties.\\n      \\n We are living at present in an age\\n      which may very justifiably be regarded as a violent age in which have been\\n      developed so many appalling instruments of destruction, the use of some of\\n      which we are quite complacently accepting and from the use of others we\\n      are refraining, not because we consider them immoral, but simply through\\n      the fear of the wholesale destruction which would be caused by their use.\\n      We are seeing X-rays used in very high voltages in the treatment of\\n      cancer, we are being constantly remained of the use of dangerous drugs in\\n      medicine, without justification, in my opinion, bearing in mind the\\n      doubtful and evanescent ameliorations they produce and the violent\\n      surgical treatment of mental patients.\\n      \\n One further violence we should not\\n      forget is the way some of our foods are devitalized by the extraction of\\n      this or that portion of the natural product for purposes quite foreign to\\n      the well - being of the people who are to feed on them; or they are\\n      contaminated by the addition of this or that dangerous chemical, either\\n      during the growing of the plant, in the form of sprays, or as so called\\n      improvers in, for instance, the manufacture of white bread. It is very\\n      significant in this regard that quite a lot of attention is paid to the\\n      protection of the man who sprays the crops, but the right of the consumer\\n      to have uncontaminated food is slurred over by the unjustifiable statement\\n      that the amount of these chemicals so consumed is so small that it cannot\\n      have any bad effect on the consumer. We who practice Homoeopathy know how\\n      unwarranted is such a statement.\\n      \\n Can we homoeopathic physicians and\\n      patient hope to be able to do anything to make the still small voice of\\n      Homoeopathy heard in all this tumult, so that we may return to a saner and\\n      more healthful way of life and help our young Queen in her lifes work for\\n      the communitys sake?\\n      \\n Can we expect any help from the leaders\\n      of the medical profession? I am afraid not, because although I believe it\\n      accurate to state that there is a very slowly growing interest in, and\\n      tolerance of our work by individual doctors, the medical authorities are\\n      still, in their prejudice, strongly opposed to us. The London University\\n      still refuses to recognize our Hospital as a post - graduate teaching\\n      Hospital: the British Medical Association prohibits the formation of a\\n      homoeopathic section of its organization, and the Royal College of\\n      Physicians still refuses its membership to any one known as a homoeopathic\\n      physician. Yet in spite of this unfavourable environment, I firmly believe\\n      that there is a future for our method of therapeutics: but it will have to\\n      be pursued with courage, determination, foresight and energy. Surely if we\\n      believe as I do, that we are the guardians of a system of treatment\\n      destined to make our people healthier and therefore more efficient and\\n      happier, we would be failing in our duty to our country if we did not take\\n      every means in our power to acquaint the community at large with the\\n      advantages of this system and the dangers of ignoring it. This is a duty,\\n      not only of the profession, but also of the laity interested in\\n      Homoeopathy and who have experienced its benefits.\\n      \\n Every physician has two professional\\n      obligation to the community, that of preserving its health and that of\\n      endeavouring to restore it to being when it has fallen by the way.\\n      \\n The homoeopathic physician, thorough\\n      his knowledge acquired through the provings of drugs, even in\\n      infinitesimal doses, has, I believe, a very special responsibility as\\n      regards the prophylaxis of disease. It seems to me that a great deal of\\n      chronic ill health may quite conceivably be due to the manipulations of\\n      our foods and to the artificial manuring of the ground in which many of\\n      them are grown. Experiments have been carried our proving that plants\\n      grown in soil enriched by natural manuring, are much less prone to\\n      diseases than those grown with the help of artificial chemical manures. It\\n      seems a fairly justified conclusion that vegetables grown under these\\n      artificial conditions may quite well be deficient in something necessary\\n      for our perfect health. It is therefore incumbent upon the physician to\\n      advocate whenever possible the ingestion of healthily grown foods in the\\n      widest sense of that term.\\n      \\n The same duty applies when we consider\\n      the great amount of drugging in which the community at large indulges by\\n      its excessive smoking, particularly when aggravated by the practice of\\n      inhaling, and by the continued and prolonged use of drugs for this or that\\n      symptom, too often, unfortunately, though not always, on the prescription\\n      of their medical advisors.\\n      \\n There is a great lack throughout the\\n      community of any real enthusiasm for perfect health: we are only too prone\\n      to be content to follow like sheep, the unintelligent and harmful\\n      practices of the majority of our fellows.\\n      \\n Similarly in the curative realm, we\\n      homoeopathic physicians have special obligations.\\n      \\n When considering our position vis-a-vis\\n      the rest of the profession, we must never lose sight of the fact that our\\n      approach to the sick individual is a much broader and more comprehensive\\n      one than that of the dominant school. This latter prides itself on its\\n      scientific approach to its problems. One must, however, always be on ones\\n      guard against being hypnotized by that word scientific. The scientific\\n      aspect of any phenomenon or problem dealing with humanity is only one\\n      limited aspect of that problem. To get a complete picture one must\\n      consider other aspect, such as the aesthetic, emotional, maybe religious,\\n      and above all, perhaps one might say embracing all, the philosophical\\n      approach. This complex approach to his patients problem is the one that\\n      the homoeopathic physician always strives to adopt, and so never loses\\n      sight of the ego of the patient, while at the same time not forgetting his\\n      physical make - up.\\n      \\n Because this approach of ours to our\\n      patients is a much broader and more comprehensive one than the much\\n      vaunted scientific aspect, which the dominant school has come to regard as\\n      the Ultima Thule of medicine, I deplore the oft - repeated request of some\\n      of my colleagues that we should forsake our philosophy and make our work\\n      as scientific as theirs. I do not mean to imply by this that we should\\n      neglect the scientific angle of our patients illness but we should always\\n      remember that is only one facet of our problem. That is why we take such\\n      pains to diagnose our patients personality with his reaction to his\\n      environment in addition to the physical diagnosis of the case in order to\\n      arrive at our prescription for his malady. In other words, we should\\n      endeavour to lead our dominant school colleagues to our way of thinking,\\n      rather than that we should adopt theirs.\\n      \\n At the same time must always remember\\n      that if our philosophy should seem at any time to contradict so - called\\n      scientific laws, we must re - examine our philosophy, and if necessary\\n      modify it, while at the same time remembering that many times in the past\\n      what have been regarded as laws have ultimately been proved not to be so.\\n      Thus it is evident that we must never relax our self - examination.\\n      \\n What shall be the role of the\\n      homoeopathic laity?\\n      \\n The first thing for them to remember is\\n      that we are living in a democratic country whose government is dependent\\n      on the goodwill of the governed, and that, if a sufficient number of\\n      voters desire a certain line of action, that line will be adopted by the\\n      government.\\n      \\n The second thought is that there are\\n      not nearly sufficient doctors practising Homoeopathy in Great Britain to\\n      satisfy the present demand, let alone any further increased demand in the\\n      future, for this line of treatment.\\n      \\n Does not this seem strange, having\\n      regard to the great advantage to humanity that Homoeopathy provides? Not\\n      if one looks below the surface and so finds the reason for this shortage.\\n      \\n Surely the most potent reason is that\\n      Homoeopathy is not taught in the official Medical Schools, either as a pre\\n      - or post - graduate study. The London University when asked to recognize\\n      the Royal London Homoeopathic Hospital as a post - graduate Medical\\n      School, refused on the plea that as Homoeopathy was not taught in the\\n      undergraduate Medical Schools, it could not find a place for it in its\\n      post - graduate curriculum.\\n      \\n It is, of course, nonsense to suggest\\n      that a graduate should pursue his studies only in those subject of which\\n      he had already obtained some knowledge in his undergraduate days and\\n      should not wish to obtain information on any new or extra subject.\\n      \\n The University Medical Shools are\\n      enabled to a great extent through Government grants. We must therefore\\n      find some way of influencing whatever Government be in power to bring\\n      pressure to bear upon the London University to remove this obstacle to the\\n      better health of the community at large. I am quite satisfied that once\\n      this academic recognition is obtained we shave many more post - graduate\\n      students of Homoeopathy.\\n      \\n I believe than in a democratic\\n      community, having a universal State Medical Service, it is the bounden\\n      duty of the Government to remove all obstacles to the peoples obtaining\\n      that form of medical treatment in which they have confidence. So long as\\n      Homoeopathy is denied its legitimate status, so long must be Government be\\n      deemed to b failing in its duty to the country.\\n      \\n If, however, we are to achieve this\\n      desirable object of full recognition, we must all, professional and laity,\\n      be fired with enthusiasm, not only for the abstract cause of Homoeopathy,\\n      but for being partners with our young Queen in delicating our lives to the\\n      community.\\n      \\n When we do this we shall help to make\\n      this second Elizabethan era one to be remembered throughout the ages to\\n      come as surpassing the first Elizabethan era in that it gained not so much\\n      the economic and political leadership of the world - though that is not to\\n      be despised - but showed the way to the most healthful and spiritual way\\n      of life that all the world look notice and followed suit.\\n      \\n To sum up, the Role of Homoeopathy, as\\n      I see it, is to humanize the practice of medicine. By that I mean it must\\n      bring the practice of medicine into line with a reasoned philosophy of\\n      life, restore to it its artistry and rid it of all unnecessary hazards. It\\n      is to do this, not from any abstract academic sense of superiority, but in\\n      order the years to come are not those of merely another reign, but to\\n      ensure a veritable Renaissance, starting with the second Elizabethan era\\n      in which Great Britain will take its rightful place in the comity of\\n      nations as the pathfinder to a way of life for which posterity will be\\n      able to say \"Thank God for Queen Elizabeth the Second and her\\n      peoples.'\n",
      " 'Tresorie - Roentgenometric Pelvimetry [Roentgenometric Pelvimetry]\\n CHARLES W.PERKINS, M.D.\\n      \\n Norwalk, Conn\\n      \\n FOR some time the x-ray has been used\\n      to advantage in diagnosis of multiple pregnancy, position of fetus and\\n      fetal abnormalities. However, it has been only the past four or five years\\n      that any definite information has been obtained by roentgenographic\\n      methods of diagnoses in pelvimetry.\\n      \\n At the present time we are convinced\\n      that only by means of roentgenographs can be true proportions of the\\n      superior strait be determined, and that the ordinary external methods of\\n      Pelvimetry are not only occasionally misleading but proportionately\\n      inaccurate.\\n      \\n The present communication deals with\\n      the method of Herbert Thomas of Yale University. This method was developed\\n      in cooperation with the late Dr. W.A. Lafield, who was Professor of\\n      Roentgenology at the Yale Medical School.\\n      \\n Some of the reasons why roentgen\\n      pelvimetry has not been more universally adopted are probably due to the\\n      following factors.\\n      \\n (1) The majority of women will be\\n      delivered normally, whether or not pelvic measurements are made.\\n      \\n (2) The medical profession does not\\n      readily accept a new method after an established satisfactory routine has\\n      been in use.\\n      \\n (3) A new method of diagnosis incurs\\n      added expense.\\n      \\n (4) The present methods, although\\n      entirely speculative, are satisfactory in most cases.\\n      \\n (5) Roentgen pelvimetry cannot be\\n      performed by the obstetrician himself but requires the aid of a\\n      roentgenologist.\\n      \\n (6) The value of roentgenometric\\n      diagnosis is recent in origin and as yet not universally accepted.\\n      \\n If the knowledge of the size and shape\\n      of the pelvis is necessary to the practice of obstetrics, roentgen\\n      pelvimetry is a sound procedure, particularly in pre-emptors patients, and\\n      should and should be considered as an indispensable aid in these cases.\\n      \\n The method of Herbert Thoms as\\n      developed at Yale Medical School is not the only method. However, it can\\n      be classified as simple, accurate and rapid; being adaptable for use by\\n      other than experts in x-ray and obstetric diagnosis. As a technical\\n      procedure a well trained hospital technician can master its technic alter\\n      sufficient instruction.\\n      \\n Studies of recent years reveal the fact\\n      that external Pelvimetry fails to give uniform and accurate information in\\n      regard to the shape and size of the superior strait. This is often true of\\n      thin undersized individuals. In many patients of this type external\\n      measurements may suggest a contracted pelvis while the x-ray will show a\\n      relatively large pelvis with a subsequent natural labor and normal-sized\\n      child. On the other hand a stocky short person with similar external\\n      measurements will disclose a contracted pelvis which is an obstetric\\n      problem. Because of the apparent relationship between shortening of the\\n      transverse diameter and a secondary persistent occipito-posterior\\n      presentation, accurate information regarding this diameter is of clinical\\n      significance.\\n      \\n The observations of Thomas were made on\\n      twenty consecutive patients whose pelvis showed a relative or real\\n      shortening of the transverse diameter of the superior strait. In every\\n      instance a primary or secondary occipito posterior position was found\\n      after the patient was in labor. (Herbert Thoms, Surgery, Gynecology and\\n      Obstetrics, January, 1933). It therefore has been proved that an actual or\\n      relative shortening of a transverse diameter of the superior strait\\n      results in a limitation of space that is greater in the anterior than in\\n      the posterior half of the superior strait. Under these circumstances, when\\n      the head descends early in labor, the occiput is forced to rotate\\n      posteriorly.\\n      \\n The x-ray offers additional information\\n      in determining the size of the fetal head. It has been noted in x-ray\\n      examination of the unengaged fetal head that it lay with the transverse\\n      diameter of the superior strait, the occiput being either to the right or\\n      left; therefore, if roentgenogram of the patient is taken in the supine\\n      position with the fetus in the uterus, it will cast a shadow which is an\\n      enlarged profile of the head. The measurements of the occipital frontal\\n      diameter of the head can then be made. On numerous occasions this method\\n      of cephalometry, determining the diameter of the unmoulded head before and\\n      after cesarean section, has yielded accurate results. (Thomas, A.M.A.,\\n      February 24, 1934).\\n      \\n As experience increases in roentgen\\n      pelvimetry, the so-called labor test will be employed less. This, however,\\n      does not mean that the physician should not under estimate the importance\\n      of uterine contraction and the ability of the fetal head to mold. It has\\n      always followed that when something could be proved desirable in medicine\\n      for the better protection of the patient, such an advance would be\\n      demanded and eventually become routine. We may concede, therefore, that\\n      roentgen pelvimetry has a distinct place in the examination of every\\n      primiparous woman. In many instances, according to Thomas and others,\\n      external; measurements were normal but the x-ray examination revealed a\\n      contracted pelvis. On the other had, in certain patients whose external\\n      measurements suggested a cesarean section roentgen pelvimetry proved\\n      otherwise and they were subsequently delivered in a normal manner.\\n      \\n CENTIMETER GRID METHOD.\\n      \\n The procedure in this method may be\\n      summarized by stating the following:.\\n      \\n (1) The patient is placed on the\\n      roentgenographic table in the semi- recumbent position.\\n      \\n (2) The level of the superior strait\\n      above the sensitized film is established.\\n      \\n (3) The tube target is centered about\\n      five centimeters posterior to the symphysis, at thirty-two inches from the\\n      sensitized film, The exposure is made.\\n      \\n (4) The patient is removed from the\\n      table, the tube target and sensitized film remaining in situ.\\n      \\n (5) A lead plate, or centimeter grid,\\n      with perforations exactly one centimeter apart, is introduced into the\\n      same plane as that previously occupied by the superior strait and a second\\n      (flash) exposure is made on the same sensitized film as was used used in\\n      the previous exposure.\\n      \\n (6) Development of the film shows the\\n      outline of the superior strait and the shadows of the perforations, the\\n      assistance between which represents centimeters in the plane of the\\n      superior strait. The anteroposterior and transverse diameters of the\\n      superior strait in its use proportions may be drawn on centimeter-square\\n      paper by following the course of the shadow of the superior strait and\\n      transcribing it.\\n      \\n As this time I wish to express my\\n      thanks to Dr. Thoms for his personal advice and instruction which helped\\n      me to master the technic of his method.'\n",

      " 'Tresorie - THE EFFICACY OF THE VIBROMETER IN APPLYING VIBRATORY MASSAGE\\nIN AURAL DISEASES [Efficacy Of Vibrometer In Applying Vibratory Message In Aural\\nDisease]\\n\\n SINCE presenting my paper before the\\n      American Institute, in June of last year on \"Vibratory Motion as a\\n      Method of Massage in Aural Diseases,\" I have been using an instrument\\n      specially devised for that purpose called the \"vibrometer.\" This\\n      instrument is in shape like a banjo, and has four strings stretched across\\n      its length resting on a bridge, which sets upon a diaphragm. On each side,\\n      elevated above the diaphragm and supported by posts, are two horizontal\\n      bars, which support the mechanical appliances used for producing the\\n      various vibratory motions. This consists in what is called a yoke, in\\n      which revolves a shaft connected with the electro-motor by pulley-wheels\\n      and a belt. Behind the diaphragm is a shallow air-tight compartment,\\n      leading from which are rubber tubes that are inserted in the external\\n      auditory canal during treatment, consequently any vibratory motion of the\\n      diaphragm, which must necessarily be an inward and a corresponding outward\\n      movement, would be exactly reproduced upon the membrana tympani, as the\\n      confined air, not being able to escape, will undergo an alternate\\n      condensation and rarefication in the external auditory canal.\\n      \\n Every vibratory movement of the strings\\n      of the instrument is communicated to the diaphragm by means of the bridge\\n      upon which it rests. These strings by varying their tension and length can\\n      be regulated to give a high or low rate of vibration as desired, for\\n      instance, the heaviest string left at its original length adjusted to a\\n      slight tension may make about fifty vibratory motions to the second, while\\n      the highest string on the instrument adjusted to a high tension and\\n      clamped down to one-fourth its original length would probably make three\\n      thousand vibratory motions to the second.\\n      \\n In the centre of the diaphragm is an\\n      attachment which works on a lever, and when hit by the cam on the\\n      revolving shaft lifts the diaphragm to a considerable extent, causing a\\n      powerful effect on the membrana tympani. This attachment can be adjusted\\n      at four different leverages, which causes a modification or increase of\\n      its intensity and can be regulated at from one to twenty-five vibratory\\n      movements to the second. This is only used in very bad cases and for not\\n      more than five minutes continuously.\\n      \\n The instrument which I have been\\n      describing in an improvement on the first manufactured, and as far as I\\n      know, is the only one which offers the same facilities for applying this\\n      method of massage. The class of patients in my experience who are\\n      generally benefited from the first, are those in which the mucous membrane\\n      lining the tympanic cavity and Eustachian tubes is in a hypertrophic\\n      condition. The membrana tympani are depressed, opaque, and thickened. They\\n      usually complain of a stiffed sensation in the ears, with a great deal of\\n      tinnitus aurium, and that their hearing is worse during a cold. In cases\\n      where the mucous membranes are atrophied with a large external auditory\\n      canal perfectly dry and Eustachian tubes patulous, and generally very\\n      little tinnitus, this or no other treatment has done very much good in the\\n      majority of cases, and in looking ever my records I find that only about\\n      five per cent. have been relieved, while in the before-mentioned cases the\\n      good results reach at least seventy-five per cent. In treating persons, I\\n      always select the rate of vibration which corresponds in pitch, if\\n      possible, to that caused by the diseased condition of the ears. If there\\n      is no tinnitus to guide me, I find whether the patient can hear a high or\\n      low sound better; if it is a low sound, a high rate of vibration is used\\n      in treatment, and vice versa, A point which I would like to explain here\\n      is this: It is not necessary that the sound from the instrument should be\\n      of the same quality of the tinnitus experienced by the patient, but merely\\n      the same pitch. for instance, if a banjo, where one of the strings was\\n      adjusted when sounded to produce a certain note, and a musical instrument\\n      of any other kind, whose quality of tone was entirely different, was made\\n      to sound the same note in a room, the string on the banjo would vibrate in\\n      sympathy, which has been proven by experiment, any other note, no matter\\n      how loud, would have no effect. Another point is in the way the strings of\\n      the vibrometer are set in motion. On the revolving shaft is a wheel\\n      projecting from which are metallic picks which hit the string it is\\n      adjusted over. It does not make any difference in the number of vibratory\\n      motions per second, whether the string is hit fast or slow, but at the\\n      time the string is first hit the intensity is greater than it is just\\n      before being hit again, and as the motion of the wheel is perfectly\\n      rhythmic, revolving so many times to the second, it has just as good an\\n      effect as if the intensity during the fraction of a second did not vary at\\n      all. The idea of using vibratory motion, as I have said before, originated\\n      within my mind some years ago, and later put into practical operation, and\\n      as far as I know, was the first to lay before the profession in a\\n      scientific manner, this method of massage.\\n      \\n I have found that when two of the\\n      strings upon the vibrometer were regulated in such a way that when both\\n      were set in vibration at the same time, producing the sensation of a\\n      harmonious sound, the effect in some cases on the tinnitus was especially\\n      beneficial, relieving, where the various kinds of vibrations produced by a\\n      single string failed. Sub-acute cases of deafness, accompanied by tinnitus\\n      aurium, are quickly relieved, as the following case will illustrate:.\\n      \\n Mrs. M. Young, married lady, aet. 26,\\n      called at my office, April 1, 1893, complaining of partial deafness and\\n      tinnitus aurium. She had a stuffed sensation, or as if cotton had been\\n      packed in the external auditory canal. She says the tinnitus was so\\n      annoying as to prevent sleep. On examination, found considerable\\n      retraction of the membrana tympani, and hearing for the watch, on the\\n      right side five inches, on the left, seven inches. The Eustachian tube\\n      were partially closed, which made inflation somewhat difficult, giving\\n      slight relief. I used several of the vibrations on the different strings\\n      without immediate benefit.\\n      \\n April 4th.-She came again, and reported\\n      that no improvement had taken place. I again inflated her ears, after\\n      which she sat down to the vibrometer. The central attachment was used with\\n      considerable force continuously for four minutes, after which she declared\\n      that the tinnitus had entirely ceased in the right ear, and greatly\\n      modified in the left; the hearing for the watch had increased for both\\n      ears to fourteen inches, and the stuffed sensation had almost entirely\\n      disappeared. On inspection of the membrana tympani, found them\\n      comparatively very slightly retracted. On April 8th, found improvement had\\n      continued, when the same treatment was used for three minutes; after which\\n      she declared herself completely relieved of the tinnitus and stuffed\\n      sensation, with hearing powerfully restored. Saw her again on April 13th,\\n      when she declared the good results from last treatment to have still\\n      continued.\\n      \\n I find that in the majority of cases,\\n      when the strings of the instrument are used it is only necessary to strike\\n      them lightly with the friction wheel. In vibrating the heavy string, I\\n      generally set the bridge back behind the central attachment, and adjusting\\n      the motor in such way that the belt is at a considerable tension, so that\\n      the pulley-wheel revolves slowly. I also generally use this adjustment\\n      when setting in motion two strings at one time. The principle of this\\n      method of treatment embraces two essential features which to my mind makes\\n      this system of massage the only scientific one applicable to the membrana\\n      tympani and its associate sound-conducting parts. Message is the\\n      application of motion to disease, and its scientific administration\\n      consists of its application in a systematic manner. In applying massage in\\n      aural diseases, it is necessary to produce a to-and-fro movement of the\\n      membrana tympani, and, if possible, by a force which is harmless and at\\n      the same time effective. The vibrometer fulfils these conditions. Any of\\n      the strings on the instrument that may be set in motion by the\\n      friction-wheel, will produce a certain number of vibratory movements to\\n      the second of time, and the movements of the central attachment are also\\n      measured. What could be more systematic than this? The motions of the\\n      membrana tympani were intended by nature to its vibratory, and as the\\n      vibrometer generates measured motion, and these motions are vibratory,\\n      theoretically we have a scientific and effective method of massage in\\n      aural diseases; and, as demonstrated practically by the use of the\\n      vibrometer, we have in fact a great scientific advance over all previous\\n      methods. Since the introduction of this treatment in aural diseases, it\\n      makes possible a more or less benefit in cases of deafness heretofore\\n      considered hopeless, and has opened up the field for the treatment of\\n      aural diseases to such an extent that the number of deaf patients seeking\\n      relief at the aurist\\'s hands will at least double itself.\\n      \\n DISCUSSION.\\n      \\n H.C. HOUGHTON, M.D.: Dr. Garey\\'s\\n      admirable paper gives us the description of the vibrometer, an instrument\\n      devised under his personal direction and inspection, for the purpose of\\n      applying massage to the ear. It is the only instrument of the kind on the\\n      market, so far as I am aware, and after a somewhat prolonged use of it, I\\n      am prepared to recommend the latest production of the vibrometer company.\\n      \\n This instrument is a decided\\n      improvement over the instrument first sent out, and is capable of\\n      producing a most profound effect upon the drum-head and ossicula; indeed,\\n      upon the entire auditory apparatus. I am able to confirm Dr. Garey\\'s\\n      statement of the effect of high and low vibrations us regards treatment.\\n      \\n I have also been very much interested\\n      in the use of stringed or reed instruments for diagnosis, and find that we\\n      can detect any abnormal sensitiveness of the auditory nerve to high or low\\n      tones. Some patients are extremely sensitive to all tones, high or low;\\n      others to high tones and not to low tones; others, conversely. Again, in\\n      some instances, there is a peculiar sensitiveness to single tones or to\\n      discords produced by sounding the note and half-note at the same time.\\n      Under the action of the central attachment of the vibrometer this\\n      sensitiveness is modified, the sensitiveness to high tones disappearing\\n      and being replaced by a low tone or, conversely, under treatment, a low\\n      tone disappears and a high tone is established, temporarily, at least.\\n      Again, in cases of recent origin, treatment will substitute an undefined\\n      rushing sound for a definite musical tone, either high or low, and later,\\n      the treatment will abolish this, the patient being relieved of this\\n      intensely annoying symptom. In some cases, with this relief, there is an\\n      improvement in the audition; in other cases, no improvement follows.\\n      \\n I confess to the domination of the\\n      material over my mind in my earlier experience with massage, and I think\\n      the inclination of operators will be to use a far greater degree of power\\n      than is necessary. I therefore notice with great satisfaction Professor\\n      Garey\\'s remark that \"the object should be to produce a to-and-fro\\n      motion to the membrana tympani, and, if possible, by a force which is\\n      harmless and at the same time effective.\" I would hardly say\\n      \"to-and-fro motion of the drum-head,\" because I think that the\\n      expression is liable to perpetuate the motion which is fixed in the minds\\n      of most physiologists, that the drum-head moves as a whole, with a\\n      to-and-fro motion.\" That is true under the influence of the Politzer,\\n      Siegle\\'s otoscope and similar instruments; but it certainly does not so\\n      move in the ordinary function of audition, but stands as the iris does in\\n      the eye, as an adjustor, a regulator of sound-force; in some sense as the\\n      iris does in its relation with the lens, to adjust, regulate and direct\\n      the essential force, and the vibration of the drum-head is at every node;\\n      every portion receives impressions that are converted into molecular\\n      disturbances of varying lengths, according as they are produced upon the\\n      stiff and unyielding portions of the drum-head at the periphery, along the\\n      manubrium, or in the more attenuated and easily-yielding portions which\\n      the between these two areas. Not only so, but these impulses are\\n      communicated to the contained air of the tympanum, and make their\\n      impression upon the acoustic nerve through the round window synchronously\\n      with the impression made through the ossicula.\\n      \\n This whole subject widens before my\\n      mind in such a way that one might wish himself twenty years and at liberty\\n      to devote himself to a term of research in acoustics, such as is offered\\n      only in the technical schools of the continent of Europe.\\n      \\n WM. R. KING, M.D.: In discussing Dr.\\n      Garey\\'s paper I shall begin by saying that his methods have been closely\\n      followed by me since the beginning of his experiments, owing to the fact\\n      that I have been greatly interested in the treatment of deafness and\\n      tinnitus by means of sound waves or by aural massage since 1887, and have\\n      experimented and treated many cases by this method since then, though with\\n      crude and unsatisfactory instruments. Since using the vibrometer-which,\\n      after much study and experimentation, is now presented to the profession\\n      in practical shape-I have undoubtedly increased my percentage of good\\n      results.\\n      \\n I don\\'t believe I am over-sanguine or\\n      carried away by interest in this method, and believe I can rightly\\n      appreciate that this does not offer us a panacea or cure-all for auditory\\n      ailments, and hope I may always be ready to see the failures and to strive\\n      to find methods or remedies to reach some of them.\\n      \\n In speaking of the application of the\\n      instrument, I wish to call attention to the central attachment or post foe\\n      vibrations. Dr. Garey has not given it as much attention in the paper as\\n      it deserves. It is very useful as a general means of aural massage,\\n      rougher in nature and more general in application than the strings which\\n      help to make up the instrument. I often use it before applying the\\n      \"similar found\" to a given case, as a species of gymnastics, to\\n      stimulate secretion and motion in the conducting apparatus of the ear,\\n      viz., membrana tympani and ossicles. In most cases-in fact, in all-where\\n      tinnitus is present, I follow this up immediately by the nearest approach\\n      to the similar pitch obtainable.\\n      \\n I agree thoroughly with Dr. Garey, that\\n      the best results are achieved in cases accompanying hypertrophic catarrh,\\n      and that the least benefit is apparent in cases of atrophic nature.\\n      \\n Regarding the method of treatment in\\n      the absence of tinnitus, my experience the does not coincide with that of\\n      the author of the paper entirely; I do not feel that as yet we have any\\n      safe rule to guide us. My method has been to try the numerous sounds and\\n      variations the of until I find the one that seems to give the best\\n      immediate results, or that the patient himself will speak of as very\\n      penetrating and powerful )though not necessarily loud and heavy).\\n      \\n It seems almost impossible at present\\n      to simulate all the qualities of tone as they occur in the ears of those\\n      suffering with tinnitus; in fact, it would appear to be unnecessary.\\n      However, it seems advantageous and quite necessary to secure the closest\\n      simulation of pitch, thus in many cases soon obliterating annoying\\n      tinnitus and improving hearing powers.\\n      \\n The arrangement permitting of the\\n      picking of two strings simultaneously adds decidedly the usefulness of the\\n      instrument, as it increases the range of pitch as well as varying the\\n      quality of tones procurable, thereby decidedly enlarging our field of\\n      application.\\n      \\n The force used for creating the message\\n      or gymnastics of the membrana tympani and the ossicles-viz, vibratory\\n      force or sound- carefully and scientifically applied, is nature\\'s remedy,\\n      because it is adapted by nature, and is the only force which can rightly\\n      or safely be applied to these delicate portions of this complex organ of\\n      hearing.\\n      \\n A startling commentary on this subject\\n      is the array of cases benefited who have been relegated to the shelf by\\n      ancient and modern otology; cases declared unhelpable have been vastly\\n      improved. Pray, make no mistake; I did not say all cases.\\n      \\n It may be interesting to hear the\\n      latest regarding the instrument which was first invented for the\\n      application of this method of aural massage Mr. E.J. Godman, the inventor\\n      and patentee, is constantly on the lookout, and always striving for\\n      improvements to his machine. He has made many that you all know of. Permit\\n      me to report a few so recent they have not yet left the factory.\\n      \\n First.-The machine has been taken from\\n      its case, and is now mounted on a solid stand or table of oak, being set\\n      below the level, or so that the face of the instrument is just level with\\n      the face of the table. This is all supported by rigid, solid metal legs,\\n      which absolutely prevent foreign vibrations.\\n      \\n Second.-The motor has been removed from\\n      its little shelf and relegated below the table. I t can be placed upon a\\n      box on the floor, a shelf against the wall, or, better yet, a shelf\\n      solidly attached to the metal supports of the table. A belt goes up\\n      through an aperture to a wheel on a shaft, the other extremity of which\\n      carries a wheel with a rubber tire (a friction wheel), which in its\\n      revolution, being in contact with a larger flat- surfaced wheel on the\\n      main shaft of the instrument, turns this in harmony with itself. This\\n      arrangement does away with the necessity of shifting the motor each time\\n      you wish to shift the carriage from one string to another- a consummation\\n      to be devoutly thankful for. The removal of the motor from the instrument\\n      as at present attached will recommend itself to all who have used the\\n      vibrometer, a great amount of undesirable jar being thus avoided.\\n      \\n Third.-Ratchet keys capable of very\\n      fine adjustment of tension of strings are now provided for the instrument.\\n      \\n Fourth.-A rheostadt or resistance-coil\\n      is now to be placed beneath the table between the storage battery and the\\n      switch, by this means enabling us to control the speed and number of\\n      revolutions to a nicety.\\n      \\n Other, though comparatively minor,\\n      improvements are being made, and others are contemplated, as, for\\n      instance, the substitution of a roughly corrugated rubber band for the\\n      picker on the wheel, thereby getting rid of the metallic sound of the\\n      picker on the wire strings.\\n      \\n I have experimented with a number of\\n      appliance for the production of the sounds and pitches that I have\\n      required, but I always fall back on the vibrometer, especially as at\\n      present constructed, for satisfactory work and results.\\n      \\n This instrument may be, and probably\\n      is, as yet, in its infancy. It, and the method it applies, can only be\\n      perfected by constant work and experimentation both on the part of the\\n      profession and of the manufacturers. Each improvement we can suggest, if\\n      it only should serve as a means of helping one solitary case, would be\\n      well worth our while.\\n      \\n The experiments being made by different\\n      methods for treating deafness by sound waves is indicative of the interest\\n      the profession has taken in the matter. It is indicative of a lack of\\n      something in our usual armamentarium which is greatly longed for by\\n      patient and doctor; that is, the means for making the deaf hear and for\\n      relieving distressing tinnitus. There has been a dearth in this direction,\\n      and perhaps there still is, but I believe fully that we have in aural\\n      massage by vibratory force a decided acquisition at our hands.\\n      \\n E. H. LINNELL., M.D.: I would simply\\n      like to ask Dr. King how long he uses the instrument, and whether he uses\\n      it according to the deafness.\\n      \\n DR. KING: Yes, decidedly. In an intense\\n      case of deafness I would have to use it a great deal longer. The central\\n      attachment I never carry over three or five minutes, and the whole\\n      treatment I don\\'t think is over carried over twenty or twenty-five minutes\\n      in one case, and usually averages from ten to fifteen.\\n      \\n HAROLD WILSON, M.D.: I have only to\\n      suggest, what I have elsewhere called attention to, the possibility of\\n      another mechanical device for securing vibratory motion. It is well known\\n      that in the make and break of a current of electricity, in the circuit of\\n      which there is a telephone, we get an influence upon the make and break of\\n      the current in the telephone. Now, it is a simple matter with which these\\n      makes and breaks are made as to obtaining any number of vibration that you\\n      wish. You may, by a mechanical device of some rotary motion, if you\\n      choose, make and break the current as rapidly as you please until you have\\n      reached several thousand vibrations a second, or you may even make the\\n      vibrations so slow us to be easily counted. The application of this\\n      suggestion has been put in force in my own practice, more or less, in the\\n      use of the telephone as connected with the induction-coil ordinary\\n      battery. The more intense the current, the more intense the sound. You can\\n      easily see that it is mere question of mechanics to secure these two\\n      sounds-intensity of vibration and rapidity of vibration. I will say,\\n      furthermore, that it has this advantage. There is no noise in the office,\\n      which I think is not altogether true of the vibrometer. I would suggest\\n      that so far as the vibrometer is concerned, if it could be made to be\\n      noiseless to anybody but the patient, it would be a decided improvement.\\n      In that respect the telephone is a decided improvement, because there is\\n      no noise except to the patient, because the noise is right at the ear of\\n      the patient. If I were seeking for a perfected instrument in this line, I\\n      would go outside of the banjo idea. As we have the most perfect writing\\n      machines, which have no connection with the ordinary method of writing,\\n      and sewing machines, which have no connection with sewing by hand, so it\\n      occurs to me that possibly the securing of he vibratory motion upon the\\n      ears might be obtained in a totally different way from that which you get\\n      when you listen to the drum of the guitar or an ordinary musical\\n      instrument, and I would suggest that the make and break of a telephone\\n      open a very fruitful field for mechanical experimentation.\\n      \\n H.C. HOUGHTON, M.D.: In my study of\\n      this subject I made the acquaintance of Mr. Bernhardt, of New York City,\\n      who is a personal friend of Mr. Emil Berliner, the inventor of the Emil\\n      Berliner Telephone, which is the instrument by which the Bell Telephone\\n      Company maintain their monopoly at present. Mr. Berliner is the inventor\\n      of the graphophone, and has, I think, covered this whole matter which Dr.\\n      Wilson has mentioned. As ordinary Bell telephone receiver is put into the\\n      circuit of an ordinary induction machine, and you can use it just as the\\n      English people use the audiometer, and as you remove the coil you modify\\n      the vibrations, which is covered with another disk and a tube, and that\\n      tube covered with a stethoscope tube, which is the same as we use for the\\n      phonograph or vibrometer, and, as Dr. Wilson has suggested, you can modify\\n      the intensity, and of course the whole matter is adjusted by the\\n      attachment of the cord, so that you can have fine vibrations. The\\n      intensity of the vibrations is regulated by the distance to which you\\n      uncover the cord. The only difficulty in the adjustment is that it has\\n      been so severe that it is really uncomfortable, and the noise of the\\n      instrument is reduced to the minimum for office use.\\n      \\n A.B. NORTON, M.D.: I will also add that\\n      in regard to the objection Dr. Wilson makes to the noise, there is no\\n      doubt it is an annoying thing in the office, and in that line I have some\\n      men at work on my suggestion. We are devising another machine, or\\n      instrument, which is to be entirely enclosed in a cabinet, so there will\\n      be no noise whatever in the room if it is made a success. The idea is a\\n      little crude, and I am quite uncertain whether it will amount to anything\\n      or not. Then, in the line of what Dr. King was speaking in regard to Mr.\\n      Goodwin-he called, at New York, to see me last week. I made two little\\n      suggestion to him, which I think would be in line with his advancement.\\n      One is the number of the picks. The present vibrometer has four picks I\\n      suggest the experiment of trying twelve or sixteen picks, which will make\\n      a more continuous sound; it may be of some value. Then, in regard to\\n      regulating the speed of the machine: you regulate that now by a series of\\n      buttons, so as to get three different speeds. We will have a very slight,\\n      intermediate speed, and a very rapid speed. My experience with the\\n      vibrometer is especially favorable. I think the idea is in the right\\n      direction, and it is simply a matter of instrumentation.']\n",

Dietary sources of vitamin C include fruits and vegetables, particularly citrus fruits such as oranges.Severe deficiency of vitamin C causes scurvy. Although rare, scurvy results in severe symptoms and can cause death. People with scurvy are treated with vitamin C and should be under medical supervision.Many uses for vitamin C have been proposed, but evidence of benefit in scientific studies is lacking. In particular, research on asthma, cancer, and diabetes remains inconclusive, and a lack of benefit has been found for the prevention of cataracts or heart disease.The use of vitamin C in the prevention or treatment of colds remains controversial. Extensive research has been conducted. Overall, vitamin C lacked an effect on the development of colds and on cold symptoms. However, the duration of the cold shortened slightly. Notably, people living in extreme circumstances, including soldiers in the subarctic, skiers, and marathon runners, had a 50% decrease in the risk of developing a cold. This area merits additional research and may be of particular interest to athletes or people in the military.'\n",

Vitamin B12 is frequently used in combination with other B vitamins in a vitamin B complex formulation. Vitamin B12 is important in DNA synthesis. Vitamin B12 is bound to the protein in food. Acid in the stomach releases B12 from protein during digestion. Once released, B12 combines with a substance called intrinsic factor (IF) before it is absorbed into the bloodstream.The human body stores several years\\' worth of vitamin B12 in the liver, so low levels in the body are rare. Decreases in vitamin B12 levels are more common in the elderly, HIV-infected persons, and vegetarians. Inability to absorb vitamin B12 from the intestinal tract can cause a type of anemia called pernicious anemia. Fever and symptoms of \"excessive sweating\" have been reported with anemia due to low levels of vitamin B12; however, these are fixed with vitamin B12 treatment.'\n",

This is based on results. They are not\\n      hopeless cases; they are still hopeful and they get well under\\n      radiotherapy. This has happened during the last three years, not because I\\n      have changed any but because the method of radiotherapy has changed. A\\n      great change has taken place. First of all, radium and x-rays are no\\n      longer looked on a last resort.\".\\n      \\n The foregoing bears witness to the\\n      progress made in the field radiation therapy. The manufacture of more\\n      adequate apparatus and the improved technic in its use reflect this\\n      improvement. Machines are used generally delivering twenty to thirty\\n      milliamperes of current at 200 K.V., while machines operating at 750 to\\n      1,000 200 K.V., using lower milliamperes, have been installed in several\\n      places in this country. Since the question of increased voltages began to\\n      dominate the field, machines operating at 400 to 600 K.V., using sealed\\n      tubes, have been manufactured in this country as well as on the been\\n      manufactured in this country as well as on the continent. This higher\\n      powered machines occupy little more space than the usual 200 K.V. machine.\\n      \\n The effectiveness of these stronger\\n      radiations is thought to be due to (1) the increased penetration and its\\n      consequently larger percentage depth doses, (2) the supposed higher\\n      selective action of short have length radiation on malignant cells, and\\n      (3) greatly increased x-ray output. Clinics using super-voltages report\\n      that clinical results are somewhat better than those secured through the\\n      use of the lesser voltage machine.\\n      \\n Experimental effort, from the physical\\n      and biologic point of view, has been exerted to establish to standard\\n      basis for radiotherapy since Roentgens discovery thirtyfive years ago, and\\n      its application five years later. Radiotherapists have only recently begun\\n      to understand the principles of clinical application or radiotherapy in\\n      the treatment of malignant conditions.\\n      \\n Regaud selected the rabbits testicle\\n      for his experiments because its histologic cellular structure was highly\\n      sensitive to radiation, containing cells which are in a state of active\\n      mitosis resembling that of malignant tissue. In 1922, Regaud reported that\\n      of malignant, tissue. In 1922, Regaud reported that it was impossible to\\n      sterilize the testicle by a single dose of radiation without causing\\n      serious damage to the overlying skin. The dose required to produced such\\n      radio necrosis was equivalent to about three radionecrosis was equivalent\\n      to about three erythemas when administered in one dose. However, by\\n      dividing the dose in such a manner as to prolong the treatment over a\\n      period of fourteen days, a total dose of about five erythemas could be\\n      given causing complete sterilizations without damage to the skin. Thus it\\n      is seen that by prolonging the time of treatment the cutaneous dose could\\n      be increased nearly 50 per cent without causing necrosis.\\n      \\n The above experiments were reported,\\n      and the same results determined, by Schinz and Slotopolsky in 1926, and\\n      again by Regaud and Ferroux in 1927. These experiments formed the\\n      foundation for the clinical studies of Pfahler (America), Hohlfelder\\n      (Germany) and Coutard (France), who have swung the pendulum from massive\\n      radiation, as advocated by the German school, to that of the protected\\n      fractional dose method. Results have been achieved by this method which\\n      are superior to previously reported; these are obtained by the improved\\n      method of administering a large dose to the (3 days) without causing\\n      destructive effects to the surroundings normal structure (or cancer bed);\\n      its effect are rather biologic than physical. The clinical application of\\n      the method of radiation by Pfahler, Countard, and Berven (Sweden) in the\\n      treatment of cancer of the tonsil, pharynx and larynx and have proved the\\n      radio-sensitive properties of squamous carcinoma, previously considered\\n      incapable of of responding to radiation.\\n      \\n According to Coutard, the neoplasm is\\n      exposed to x-rays twice daily, giving a total dose of 350 r to400 r to two\\n      areas, using 190 to 200 k.v., four milliamperes, two millimeters of copper\\n      and three millimeters of aluminum filtration at a distance of fifty of\\n      sixty centimeters, for lesion of the head and neck. For deeply situated\\n      lesions, such as cancer of the uterus, the focal distance varies from 80\\n      to 100 centimeters, the area of the field for the head and neck conditions\\n      being only 50 to 100 square centimeters, while those of the lower abdomen\\n      require on an average of 250 to 300 square centimeters. For the\\n      sterilization of the radio-sensitive squamous carcinomatous growth, a\\n      depth dose of 3,000 r to 4,000 r is given, while stronger dose is\\n      necessary for the radio-resistant tumors.\\n      \\n In the course of treatment of principle\\n      guides a radio reaction of the covering epithelium and the radio reaction\\n      of the cancer cells. The radio reaction of the cutaneous epithelium is\\n      called \"radio epidermitis.\"characterized by loss of epithelial\\n      layers and denudation of the dermis. The reaction of the mucous membrane ,\\n      called \"radio epithelitis,\" manifests itself by loss of the\\n      epithelial layer sand denudation of the mucous membrane, epithelial layers\\n      and denudation of the corium which becomes covered by a fibrinous and\\n      false membrane; of clear. The duration of both describe radio reactions is\\n      six weeks. Each appears at the beginning of three weeks and disappears at\\n      the beginning of the ninth week.\\n      \\n Should the total or daily dose or the\\n      intensity per minute be too high, or the filtration or the tension too\\n      low, the cancer bed would be modified. the nutrition of the malignant\\n      cells becomes impaired The cellular radio- sensitivity, which seems to be\\n      linked up not only with the mitosis of the cell but above all with the\\n      activity of their interchange with the cell but above all with the\\n      activity of their interchange with the surrounding normal structures,\\n      becomes diminished and at times suppressed. The cancer cells become\\n      incentive to radiation. This phenomenon is called \"radio-\\n      vaccination\" by Regaud.\\n      \\n Observation of clinical facts shows\\n      that changes in the surrounding normal tissue result from excessive daily\\n      doses and intensity per minute per minute causing radio resistance of the\\n      tissue. Conversely, radio- sensitivity would be prolonged with a smaller\\n      daily dosage and the resultant extended period.\\n      \\n Realizing that better results may be\\n      obtained by prolonged treatment, Coutard and his collaborators in the last\\n      few years have begun to extend the duration of treatment of certain\\n      so-called radio-resistant cancers from thirty to ninety days, giving weak\\n      daily doses in order of about 175, 220, 225 and 250 r per day, dividing\\n      the dose in two treatments. By this method he was able to cure a certain\\n      number of lesions on which he had not been able previously to obtain the\\n      same results, such as very differentiated epidermoid epithelioma invading\\n      the muscles and cartilages, glandular epithelioma of the breast ad the\\n      thyroid body, and special round celled epitheliomas of the upper part of\\n      the ethmoid and the adjacent sinuses. This mode of prolonged treatment not\\n      only controlled the condition locally but it lessened the frequency of\\n      metastasis.\\n      \\n When radiating a cancer of very\\n      embryonic, very radio-sensitive growths, the energy factor is predominant.\\n      The action of the x-rays seems to be direct and rapid; the treatment can\\n      be accomplished within fifteen to twenty days. The cells are destroyed and\\n      generally normal structures are affected very little. When radiating the\\n      less embryonic type of growths, the time of treatment should be longer.\\n      \\n Pursuing these general principles, I\\n      have adopted the Countard method with some slight modifications. The cures\\n      which I shall illustrate will show that the percentage of cures in a\\n      number of most dangerous epidermoid carcinomas has markedly increased and\\n      that some conditions formerly considered hopeless have been temporarily\\n      cured. In conclusion I wish to emphasize the following facts:.\\n      \\n (1) Cure of cancer by x-rays is still\\n      difficult and must not be entered into lightly and causally.\\n      \\n (2) Radiotherapy is just as radical in\\n      method as surgery, and requires great skill, judgment and experience.\\n      \\n (3) The cooperation of the pathologist\\n      and the radiotherapist is imperative for a proper estimate of the\\n      radio-sensitivity in relation to treatment of the lesion.\\n      \\n (4) Daily examination of the patient is\\n      necessary; modification of the normal structure and general reaction by\\n      the x-ray treatment sometimes appears to quickly that it is often\\n      necessary to diminish the daily dose or the size of the field in the\\n      course of treatment.\\n      \\n (5) There exists no fixed method of\\n      treatment, only a simple clinical treatment for each individual patient\\n      and for the special type of tumor..\\n      \\n (6) Improvement in roentgen apparatus\\n      of higher voltages, producing more penetrating rays, will permit a better\\n      relation between destruction of malignant cells and preservation of the\\n      supporting, and the radio sensitivity of the tumor may be prolonged.'\n",
      " 'Tresorie - ALL INDIA HOMOEOPATHIC CONVENTION WELCOME ADDRESS [All India\\nHomoeopathic Convention Welcome Address]\\n\\n Mr. President, Friends and Colleagues.\\n      \\n It fills my heart with joy unspeakable\\n      to extend a hearty welcome to you all to this city at this All India\\n      Homoeopathic Convention held on the occasion of Bi-centennial Birth-day\\n      Anniversary of our great Master Hahnemann. This is the city where\\n      Homoeopathy was first introduced by Rajendra Lal Dutta of hallowed memory,\\n      who spent a princely fortune for dissemination of its principles and\\n      practice among his countrymen. This is the city where took place the\\n      dramatic conversion of one of the then medical luminaries of the first\\n      magnitude, to the practice of Homoeopathy under the influence of Rajendra\\n      Lal. I mean Dr. Mahendra Lal Sircar who became the high priest of\\n      Homoeopathy, spread its glory far and wide and gained thereby an\\n      international reputation for himself. This is the city where the\\n      celebrities of Homoeopathy like Dr. Berigny, Dr. Salzar, Dr. P.C.\\n      Majumdar, Dr. D. N. Roy. Dr. Younan, Dr. J.N. Majumdar, Dr. Baridbaran\\n      Mukherji, Dr. S.K. Nag, Dr. A.N. Mukherji, Dr. T.N. Palit, Dr. G.\\n      Dirghangi and a host of other talented physicians practised their\\n      profession with credit and success and held aloft the banner of\\n      Homoeopathy. This is the city where exist pioneer institutions for the\\n      teaching of Homoeopathy. This is the city wherefrom Homoeopathy has spread\\n      to all parts of India and its votaries are doing yeomans service for the\\n      good of the suffering humanity.\\n      \\n We are meeting this evening on a\\n      historic occasion and we have to arrive at decisions which might make or\\n      mar the future history of Homoeopathy in India. It may be that forces of\\n      disruption, destruction and obstruction are at work; it may be that self\\n      and vested interests seem to thwart the smooth progress of Homoeopathy; it\\n      may be that some may seem to play in the hands of the Powers that are not\\n      too sympathetic to the cause of Homoeopathy; it may be that the present\\n      seems to be chaotic and future of Homoeopathy dubious but great is truth\\n      indeed and will prevail. We should not lose heart or throw up the sponge.\\n      Tradition, authority, sectarianism, dogmatism are great obstacles on the\\n      way. But obstacles and difficulties are meant to be fought out and\\n      overcome. Strifes and dissensions, discords and disunities may hamper our\\n      progress but they are nonetheless signs of lifes activities. It is a good\\n      augury that the Homoeopathic profession is shaking off its age - long\\n      slumber and getting more and more conscious of its duties and obligation,\\n      its rights and privileges and of its short - comings and practical\\n      difficulties. The life of Hahnemann is there to encourage us; the\\n      masterful will of his dynamic spirit is there to inspire us to intensify\\n      our activities; his achievements are there to goad us to realise greater\\n      success; and his personality is always before us to take lessons from, in\\n      our life which as Swami Vivekananda puts it, is \"a process of\\n      unfolding and development of a being under circumstances tending to press\\n      it down.\"\\n      \\n That Homoeopathy is a scientific system\\n      of treatment, philosophically sound, logically unimpeachable, practically\\n      highly efficacious in curing the sick and cheap enough to suit the poor\\n      economic condition of the Indian masses - has become a much talked - of\\n      subject in the country. But why is it not spreading sufficiently and\\n      adequately in our motherland or in fact anywhere in the world? Why is our\\n      National Government not still keen on according official recognition to\\n      this superb system of healing art or providing ways and means for its\\n      development and diffusion? Why the public opinion is not gaining strength\\n      enough to put sufficient pressure on our Government to take interest in\\n      it? Why sufficient number of fully equipped Homoeopathic teaching\\n      institutions and hospitals are not growing to turn out adequate number of\\n      fully qualified Homoeopathic physicians in the country?\\n      \\n It is high time that we should draw the\\n      attention of the profession and the laity to provide answers to so many\\n      \"whys\" and to solve the pressing problems in the matter\\n      concerned. On a cursory view it becomes evident that the Homoeopathic\\n      profession, the people and the Government are each individually and\\n      collectively responsible for this impasse.\\n      \\n The so - called Allopathy still\\n      occupies the dominant place in any country, even in the land of birth of\\n      Homoeopathy. It is no wonder that Homoeopathy, being a discovery of merely\\n      a century and a half still lags behind its rival shool. But it is a wonder\\n      of wonders that Homoeopathy has already encompassed the whole world within\\n      such a short period since it was ushered into existence by Hahnemann.\\n      History of man reveals that nowhere a new truth was accepted by him easily\\n      and readily, obsessed as he is with conservatism, tradition, authority and\\n      vested interests. Nonetheless the triumphant march of Homoeopathy with a\\n      such a meteoric speed throughout the length and breadth of the world is a\\n      proof positive of the truth inherent in the system and phenomenal\\n      therapeutic efficacy of this healing art. It is one more glaring instance\\n      of mans love of truth against heavy odds that impede his progress at every\\n      step.\\n      \\n For the propagation of any new truth\\n      and its acceptance by man, in general, the first and foremost condition is\\n      the turning out of sufficient number of persons who have realised the\\n      truth and are adept in the practice of it. This involves establishment of\\n      a sufficient number of teaching institutions which will turn out experts\\n      in the science and art of Homoeopathy; and a sufficient number of\\n      Homoeopathic Hospital where, the efficacy of this system of treatment will\\n      be put to test.\\n      \\n Human knowledge is becoming\\n      unmanageably vast. The appearance of specialists has become indispensable.\\n      So special Hospitals for the treatment of specific types of diseases have\\n      sprung forth elsewhere, e.g. Tuberculosis Hospitals, Cancer Hospitals,\\n      Hospital for Tropical Diseases etc. Because of organisation of these\\n      hospitals people generally think of getting themselves treated in these\\n      institutions. As there are no fully - equipped general Homoeopathic\\n      Hospitals and not to speak of special Homoeopathic Hospitals and not to\\n      speak of special Homoeopathic Hospitals the result is Homoeopathy is not\\n      getting a fair chance of treating those diseases like tuberculosis,\\n      cancer, acute infectious diseases of epidemic type e.g., Small-pox,\\n      Cholera etc. on a large and organised scale. Consequently the general\\n      public cannot keep much faith in this treatment and mostly take recourse\\n      to homoeopathic treatment when the case is \"past all hope and past\\n      all surgery\". Hence the establishment of fully - equipped\\n      Homoeopathic institutions (College - cum - Hospitals) is an imperative\\n      necessity for enhancing the prestige of the Homoeopathic profession and\\n      for convincing the people about the therapeutic efficacy of this system of\\n      treatment. Is it not a pity that Homoeopathy once established its\\n      reputation by treating Cholera cases in this city and now nobody thinks of\\n      this treatment in Cholera cases and rushes the patient to the Allopathic\\n      Hospitals which are especially meant for these types of patients? How can\\n      we hope to gain ground under these circumstances?\\n      \\n The next great obstacle is the apathy\\n      and in many cases active antagonism of our Government, both at the Centre\\n      and at least in some of the State, towards Homoeopathy. The Government is\\n      under the thumb of its medical directorates which are solely manned by\\n      Allopathic doctors. The main reasons for the non - acceptance of the\\n      Homoeopathic system of treatment may be summed up in three words:\\n      tradition, authority and professionalism. Their psychology is easily\\n      understood if it is borne in mind that the conservative inertia of human\\n      mind attempts to reject any new thought will all the means at its\\n      disposal. Another reason is due to vested interests. Even a cursory glance\\n      at the history of origin and spread of Homoeopathy, enables one to find\\n      out that the opposition to this system from the start, was not scientific\\n      but rather of commercial nature on the part of the apothecaries who were\\n      afraid of losing their trade - profits. We regret to note that the Central\\n      Government have not yet implemented a single recommendation put forward by\\n      the Homoeopathic Enquiry Committee, Planning Commission. Third Health\\n      Ministers Conference, Ad Hoc Committee etc. though Homoeopathic Acts have\\n      been passed in the States of Bombay, U.P., Madhya Pradesh, Travancore -\\n      Cochin, Bihar etc. I is curious to note that W. Bengal is the only State\\n      where a Homoeopathic Bill has recently been thrown out by the State\\n      Government.\\n      \\n Another great obstacle is the\\n      psychology of the general mass of population who fail to adopt a proper\\n      philosophical attitude towards Homoeopathy and takes the Homoeopathic\\n      Therapeutic Law as great paradox contrary to common sense. Unless we can\\n      educate the public in the matter, we cannot hope to secure their whole -\\n      hearted support for this system of treatment.\\n      \\n Lack of enthusiasm for constructive\\n      works on the part of the Homoeopathic profession, the apathy of our\\n      Government and hesitancy on the part of the public to accept Homoeopathy\\n      are great obstacles to the spread of this system of treatment in the\\n      country. Unless this vicious circles is broken the progress of Homoeopathy\\n      is bound to be impeded. We have to fight on all fronts if we aspire to\\n      achieve victory in our battle for the cause of Homoeopathy and the\\n      suffering humanity.\\n      \\n But our first necessity as pointed out\\n      by the Soul of India expressing itself through Sri Aurobindo, is: If India\\n      is to survive and do her appointed work in the world, the youth of India\\n      should learn to think, to think on all subjects, to think independently,\\n      fruitfully, going to the heart of things, not stopped by their surface,\\n      free of pre - judgements, shearing sophism and prejudice asunder as with a\\n      sharp sword smiting down obscurantism of all kinds as with a mace of\\n      Bhima.\\n      \\n \"Let our brains no longer, like\\n      European infants, be swathed with swaddling clothes; let it have recover\\n      the free and unbound motion of the Gods, let it have not only the\\n      minuteness but the wide mastery and sovereignty natural to the intellect\\n      of Bharata and easily recoverable by it if it once accustomes itself to\\n      feel its own power and be convinced of its own worth.\\n      \\n \"The old fixed foundations have\\n      been broken up, we are tossing in the waters of a great upheaval and\\n      change. It is no use clinging to the old ice - floes of the past, they\\n      will soon melt and leave their refugees struggling in perilous waters. It\\n      is no use landing ourselves in the infirm bog, neither sea nor good, dry\\n      land of a second - hand Europeanism. We shall only die there a miserable\\n      and unclean death.\\n      \\n \"No we must learn to swim and use\\n      that power to reach the good vessel of unchanging truth; we must land\\n      again on the eternal rock of ages.\"\\n      \\n Yes, we must expand, we must assimilate\\n      whatever is assimilable for our growth. Stagnation and contraction are the\\n      signs of Death. Our knowledge must be aggressive, must diffuse through the\\n      rank and file of the whole Homoeopathic profession if we wish to survive\\n      and perpetuate ourselves; to leave an extensive ignorance either below or\\n      around us is to expose ourselves to the perpetual danger of being\\n      exterminated as a professional entity.\\n      \\n In fine, I welcome you, once again, on\\n      this historic occasion to this historic city to deliberate, to exchange\\n      view points and to come to agreed decisions with regard to our future line\\n      of action in respect of Homoeopathy in all its aspects.'\n",
      " 'Tresorie - SOME OBSERVATIONS ON NEURASTHENIA AND ITS TREATMENT\\n[Neurasthenia & Treatment]\\n\\n WHEN, thirty-five years ago, the writer\\n      first made the acquaintance of what is now called neurasthenia, it was\\n      known as spinal irritation, and the best of modern researches have been\\n      unable to give a better definition beyond a functional disturbance of the\\n      spinal and cerebral nerves, dependent on a morbid process, for which\\n      \"irritation\" is as proper a term as any. As deaths do not occur,\\n      autopsies throw no light on the subject. Briefly stated, neurasthenia,\\n      when observed from the beginning through its chronic course, has a period\\n      of prodromal symptoms followed by a protracted acute, and succeeded by a\\n      still more protracted chronic, state, between the end of which and the\\n      beginning of convalescence there is a very vague, often indiscernible,\\n      boundary line.\\n      \\n The prodromal symptoms are quite\\n      indefinite and very variable, pointing to nothing in particular. Loss of\\n      appetite, irregular sleep, excitability alternating with lassitude, etc.,\\n      are often overlooked, especially when the second stage-display of unusual\\n      mental and physical energy without subsequent fatigue- becomes apparent.\\n      This is often mistaken for a sign of unusually good health. When a young\\n      girl or mature woman, married or unmarried, feels that she can study ten\\n      hours a day and devote half of her night to pleasure or business; when\\n      besides much mental occupation she begins to rejoice in long walks without\\n      fatigue, that is the time when the mischief is going on without exciting\\n      timely suspicion. Relief is at last sought when the functional disorder of\\n      the nerves has gone to the opposite extreme, and becomes manifest in what\\n      is properly and popularly termed \"nervous prostration,\" when\\n      instead of having no sense of fatigue, the best bodily or mental effort\\n      seems intolerable, in grave cases rendering the patient a helpless being,\\n      completely dependent on the unremitting assistance of others whom she )it\\n      is usually a woman) rules with the inexorable power of the vis inertiae.\\n      \\n During this usually very protracted\\n      period of the disease convalescence usually sets in, but so imperceptibly\\n      that the physician alone can sometimes estimate its progress, which is\\n      unnoticeable to others towards whom the patient acts as she has for months\\n      or years. This is the time for action, too often delayed from motives of\\n      misplaced sympathy on the part of relatives and friends.\\n      \\n The affections is in many instances\\n      limited to the spine, the mind becoming only secondarily tired. In other\\n      cases it is spinal and cerebral; in others again chiefly cerebral. The\\n      line between this and insanity is always clearly definable. Though a\\n      neurasthenic patient may become insane, and probably the reverse, yet both\\n      are distinct conditions.\\n      \\n Books speak of this disease at common\\n      to men and women. Yet in this region in small towns as well as in large\\n      cities the cases of neurasthenia in women are preponderatingly great.\\n      \\n Hypochondriacs and hysteria stand in\\n      peculiar relation to neurasthenia. They maybe regarded as different\\n      species of the same genus; that is, more or less deeply seated\\n      disturbances of the cerebro-spinal system in which the sympathetic system\\n      is probably indirectly involved, as many functional disturbances presided\\n      over by the great sympathetic system often testify. Hypochondriasis, pure\\n      and simple as occurring in men, is easily distinguishable by its striking\\n      characteristic of introspection and despondency, occasioned by abnormal\\n      sensations, without marked physical weakness and tiredness. Pure\\n      hypochondriacs are often energetic, conscientious workers. In hysteria\\n      there is neither great tiredness nor tendency to introspection, but a\\n      paroxysmal or prolonged absence of the power of self control, in grave\\n      cases associated with tonic or clonic muscular spasm and loss of\\n      consciousness. While neurasthenia in its uncomplicated forms is free from\\n      these symptoms, but, as ample experience teaches, often complicated with\\n      both of the preceding forms to such an extent that it is often very\\n      difficult to tell which is primary and which secondary. The symptoms known\\n      as introspection, hysterical aberrations of the emotions, and neurasthenic\\n      sense of exhaustion are in their distinctive manifestations most important\\n      and constitute indications in the selection of remedial and dietetic\\n      measures.\\n      \\n The following are some observation of\\n      peculiarities observed in a large number of cases and peculiar to all:.\\n      \\n Introspection.-The neurasthenic patient\\n      in variably expresses her desire for relief, not so much in a direct\\n      appeal as in a supplicating, subdued tone of voice and manner. She rarely\\n      asks, \"What can you do to relieve me?\" but almost invariably,\\n      \"What is the cause of\" this or that sensation? If she is\\n      introspective, that is, hypochondriacal, she becomes a nosomaniac,\\n      watching acutely every one of her numerous distressing sensation, on the\\n      unremitting analysis of which her mind dwells. In marked cases she is\\n      quite unable to think of anything outside of herself, and in many cases\\n      dislikes to do so, preferring to river her attention on herself. Attempts\\n      to divert her annoy or anger her. Friends and relatives implore the\\n      physician to divert the patient, but all their attempts are in vain\\n      because quite misdirected.\\n      \\n Positive and Negative Will.-It seems\\n      sometimes as if the patient delights in her self-inspection, and that she\\n      prefers her condition to speedy recovery. This is not the case, for the\\n      patient will always assure the physician of her wish to get well. During\\n      the acute stage-a long yet definable period-this wish and longing cannot\\n      well be utilized, but the long and ill-defined period of convalescence\\n      must first be awaited. Here we shall always discover that the wish and the\\n      will of the patient are two very different mental conditions. The desire\\n      or wish for recovery is entirely unattended by any will effort to\\n      accomplish the desired end. The injunctions and directions of the\\n      physician are resisted by the same unconquerable power of negative power,\\n      or vis inertiae. The patient having been unable to exert her will, now\\n      thinks herself unable to use it.\\n      \\n Numerous Symptoms of Patients.-To\\n      physicians in search of indications for medicines each statement of\\n      patient concerning a sensation is apt to be considered as a symptom. Many\\n      years ago, when resolved to get at the keynote of a patient\\'s case, the\\n      writer determined to allow the patient to detail all her symptoms as long\\n      as she chose and to take accurate notes of each one till the right one\\n      should be disclosed; and this was to be done regardless of time and\\n      exertion. The patient, one who needed no urging to describe her\\n      \"symptoms,\" began in an almost inaudible voice, detailing one\\n      sensation after another with an unrivalled degree of clearness and\\n      vividness of expression; as she proceeded the voice became stronger, her\\n      face slightly flushed, and the most perfect descriptive language flowed in\\n      an endless stream. Each word was written down, page after page was filled;\\n      still she went on with unmistakable signs of satisfaction at being able to\\n      pour her pent-up emotions into willing and sympathetic ears. If, for a\\n      moment, the flow of language was interrupted, a simple question would\\n      re-animate her to proceed with renewed energy. Feelings seemed to beget\\n      feelings; their complexity gave the patient no trouble; her intellect was\\n      equal to the action of unraveling the most complicated sensation,\\n      separating them into their component parts and spreading them out before\\n      the mind of the listener. A glance at the watch showed that nearly two\\n      hours had passed, during which the feeblest of neurasthenic patients had\\n      talked incessantly. The note-book was full, the keynote was found. It was\\n      this: neurasthenic patients have innumerable sensation and exhibit no\\n      sings of fatigue after talking incessantly for nearly two hours.\\n      \\n Great Endurance of Neurasthenics.-The\\n      instance just related, which is one of many, illustrates two things. One\\n      is, that it is not the kind of sensation described but the fact that\\n      neurasthenics have innumerable sensations, that constitute the symptoms.\\n      The other thing is that many neurasthenics are capable of great exertion\\n      without suffering disagreeable after- effects from fatigue. This is\\n      illustrated by other cases of which I have notes. A highly neurasthenic\\n      young lady consented to camp out for her health near a lake. She was\\n      induced to join a party for a short walk along the lake. By trying what\\n      they thought a shorter road the party lost their way and took a very long\\n      walk of about four hours, through bogs and over forces. The neurasthenic\\n      was less fatigued than some of the others. The interesting observation was\\n      subsequently made that the patient had become interested in a young man of\\n      the party. She recovered her health within a year from that time. Other\\n      cases of this kind will appear under the head of therapeutic suggestions.\\n      \\n Neurasthenic Patients Crave\\n      Sympathy.-This is one of the most formidable obstacles to the curative\\n      management of such cases, for the kind of sympathy such patients crave is\\n      expressions of condolence and more or less deep affliction at so much\\n      suffering as the patient expresses. Such sympathy is most natural and does\\n      honor to the feelings of parents, sisters, brothers and husbands, but it\\n      is unfortunate that the deeper their expression of affliction so much the\\n      more profound will be the mental dejection and weakness of the patient.\\n      Almost every case which has come under the writer\\'s observation has been\\n      much hampered if not made hopeless by this condition of things, against\\n      which no remedy suggests itself that would not be construed as\\n      \"unkind\".\\n      \\n The origin of this very formidable and\\n      refractory nervous disease, like that of most diseases usually termed\\n      chronic, is either hereditary or acquired, as the histories of every\\n      observed case plainly testify. Either the father was a hypochondriac or\\n      the mother neurasthenic, or both parents were of unsound nervous\\n      constitution. Dipsomania on the part of parents produces neurasthenia in\\n      the children, as readily as it will be followed by any other form of\\n      nervous disease, according to the individual predisposition of the\\n      offspring. The excessive use of tea and coffee is another very active\\n      factor in the history of neurasthenics. Where fathers inclined to alcohol,\\n      mothers are addicted to tea and coffee, which, while its immediate effects\\n      do not obtrude themselves upon our notice, are none the less insidious in\\n      their more remote consequences.\\n      \\n The acquired forms of neurasthenia are\\n      of utmost interest to the therapeutist, and the sources of acquisition are\\n      readily stated. They are much brain-work with insufficient food and sleep.\\n      Such conditions obtain chiefly in women (less frequently in men) of fine\\n      intellectual ability, conscientiousness and ambition. Physical overwork\\n      with unintellectual women has no such effect. Quite analogous to the above\\n      are the conditions of care and sorrow, especially in women who are able\\n      for a long time to conceal and control their emotions. The usual\\n      consequence of such states of mind is disregard of food and insufficient\\n      sleep. Instances of acquired neurasthenia are presented in families of\\n      several girls and boys, where one or more of the former are Neurasthenic\\n      while the latter are vigorous and athletic. Boys delighting in vigorous\\n      exercise do not, as is the case with girls, lose appetite and sleep.\\n      \\n The effects of nervous exhaustion in\\n      boys are usually much less grave than in girls; as a rule such effects are\\n      manifested in mental, not muscular, tiredness, and they are relieved by\\n      air and exercise, while in girls and women those influences are shunned\\n      because they seem to increase the tiredness.\\n      \\n Predisposition-The temperament, or what\\n      in modern pharaseology is called the personal equation, plays a visible\\n      but uncontrollable part in the progress of neurasthenia, as temperament\\n      greatly determines the other imperfectly known condition known as\\n      predisposition. Where the disease is hereditary, it is easy to say that\\n      the predisposition is due to that source; where there is no history of\\n      heredity and where neurasthenia exists in the last members of a\\n      generation, it may be attributed to acquired predisposition which needed\\n      only the exciting cause to establish the disease in its most typical form.\\n      \\n One of the most common forms of\\n      neurasthenia, often quite intractable, results from a serious defect in\\n      our public school system, one which affects chiefly girls from twelve to\\n      fourteen years of age. The following is a brief example: The child rises\\n      late with no appetite for breakfast and no time to eat it if so inclined.\\n      The lessons, however, have been learned the evening before, and the school\\n      work is begun with an ambitions will and a crammed mind, and continues\\n      with one intermission of often not more than ten minutes or three of four\\n      hours. The pupil arrives at home ravenously hungry, eats too fast, and too\\n      much of injudiciously prepared food, too long in digesting to leave room\\n      for an appetite for even a light evening meal, or even for a breakfast the\\n      next morning.\\n      \\n In another case the girl or boy grows\\n      desperately hungry while at school, but being unprovided with food\\n      (lunch), goes on with the school exercises, at the end of which the sense\\n      of hunger has vanished and has been replaced by an aversion to normal\\n      food, with a possible craving for something pungent and indigestible. This\\n      observation can easily be made in many instances, and will, in as many\\n      cases, be seen to lead to nervous prostration, which is then treated by\\n      vile, patented concoctions consisting largely of whiskey, under the name\\n      of \"tonics,\" while the patient needs only the best that a\\n      legitimate market affords prepared in a sensible manner.\\n      \\n Typical Cases Ending in Rapid\\n      Recovery.-Curative results have already been indicated in what has been\\n      said above, and further indications for treatment may be gathered from a\\n      few cases of extremely rapid recovery of apparently incurable cases, to\\n      which brief allusion will here be made. A woman of forty had been a victim\\n      of grave neurasthenia for five years. In the absence of an inclination to\\n      exert himself, she had, during that period, been mostly confined to her\\n      bed or lounge, in the meantime giving birth to two children, going through\\n      gestation and confinement normally, without recovering from neurasthenic\\n      prostration which, in the course of some years more, rendered her entirely\\n      helpless. Her condition was associated with a feeling of dropping to\\n      pieces unless supported and braced by a harness of wood, iron and leather,\\n      in which she \"sat up\" for several hours each day, spending the\\n      rest of the time in bed. Having left the patient in this condition, it was\\n      reported before the writer\\'s next professional visit that Mrs.-had been\\n      cured, and that she was able to go out like other people. A visit to the\\n      house confirmed the report. The patient came to the door herself, and in a\\n      quiet manner, entirely without the least expression of joy or wonder at\\n      her release, stated, that having heard of a famous \"magnetic\\n      physician,\" she summoned him, was ordered by him to arise and stand;\\n      protesting that it was impossible, she was raised to her feet and again\\n      ordered to stand, then to walk. Fearing that she would fall, she begged\\n      the magnetic doctor to support her, which he peremptorily refused, saying\\n      she might fall if she liked. Instead of falling, she had to walk about the\\n      room, was then placed upon a lounge and subjected to a severe treatment of\\n      rolling and pummelling, and then ordered to dress and sit up until tired,\\n      to remain up and about like other people, and to call on the doctor in\\n      future, as he would not come so far to the patient again. This happened\\n      about twenty-five years ago, and the patient has been in very fair health\\n      arrested by insisting that all professional visits by the writer or any\\n      other physician to whose sympathy the patient could appeal must cease.\\n      This injunction was carried out conscientiously with the best results by\\n      the husband of the patient. Perhaps we may learn from this that sometimes,\\n      at least, the familiar motto is reversed, and angels rush in where fools\\n      fear to tread.\\n      \\n Profiting by this experience, another\\n      neurasthenic woman, unmarried, but of most intractable, antagonistic\\n      temperament, confined to her bed, in and out of hospitals, for years,\\n      wearing out the strength and means of her relatives and the patience of\\n      many physicians, was at length abandoned by them. It was a case of spinal\\n      and cerebral neurasthenia complicated with hypochondriasis in its most\\n      trying form of introspective maunderings and endless description of\\n      symptoms. She tormented her advisers by her endless tirades, the\\n      indulgence of which invariably aggravated her condition, and were there\\n      fore avoided, until once her physician yielded to the patient\\'s\\n      importunities for a visit, when be found her in her usual abject state of\\n      prostration. Guided by experience derived from cases like the one first\\n      described, he assisted the patient to her feet and marched her, will you\\n      nil you, up and down the room until he, at least, was thoroughly tired,\\n      and then departed with the promise never to do so again. The patient, on\\n      her part, made a number of her unnameable promises, but kept on her feet\\n      and let the doctors alone. Though not cured of deeply-rooted morbid mental\\n      faults, the neurasthenic phase of her condition had yielded to the change\\n      of the antagonistic element of her character from passive to very\\n      practical activity. A third very serious case of this kind occurred in the\\n      person of a girl of fifteen, of selfish character, who gradually became\\n      bed-ridden with spinal and cerebral neurasthenia, and tormented with the\\n      usual multifarious painful sensations, none of which, on the most\\n      pains-taking physical examination, resulted from demonstrable organic\\n      disease of genital or abdominal organs. The patient was most tenderly\\n      cared for by her mother, who, in the course of years, became so imbued\\n      with the idea of yielding to every wish and whim of the patient, that at\\n      length remonstrance became useless. The mother, though recognizing the\\n      importance of persuading or urging her daughter to depend more on herself,\\n      admitted that she had yielded so long that now she must continue to feed,\\n      dress and assist her charge in the most trivial things. Her food had to be\\n      placed in her mouth, the position of a hand or foot changed by some one\\n      else, although patient did so spontaneously when she chose. This went on\\n      for fifteen years, when the mother, growing old and feeble, died. Her\\n      maternal support being gone, the patient at once proved her ability to\\n      walk, to dress, to feed herself, and to seek light employment. Though far\\n      from well, she is equally far fro being a helpless, bed-ridden invalid.\\n      \\n A fourth case, still very vividly\\n      impressed on the writer\\'s mind, was one of a healthy, romping girl of 14,\\n      who, as happen in this remarkably capricious disease, in the midst of\\n      perfect health, one day took to her bed and remained there with all the\\n      symptoms of neurasthenia, involving first the spinal and finally the\\n      cerebral nerves. This patient was very amiable, conscientious, and\\n      sensible, never loquacious, and not troubled with hypochondriacal thoughts\\n      or sensations. Tiredness was the only expression she used in describing\\n      her feelings. There was literally no variation from this condition, which\\n      confined her to her bed for years, till she grew from a girl to a woman.\\n      Eating and sleeping well, and improving perceptibly in personal appearance\\n      and character, yet she lay on her couch tired and watched over with\\n      unremitting care by a most anxious mother, showing her solicitude and\\n      sympathy in every feature. Once, in the second year of the disease, a\\n      favorable interruption occurred. The mother, still a young woman, gave\\n      birth to another child. During her confinement the neurasthenic patient\\n      was in charge of her mother\\'s nurse, assisted by other servants. The\\n      nurse, while devoted to the daughter, agreed with the writer that excess\\n      of sympathy was injurious, and used her best and judicious endeavors\\n      gradually to persuade the patient to make some physical effort at walking\\n      and standing. In this she was so successful that in two weeks she\\n      accompanied the girl on half-mile walks up and down hill, finally without\\n      assistance. Thus, recovery seemed assured, and everything was favorable\\n      progressing towards it when the mother, having fully recovered, again took\\n      charge of her daughter, with the result that she at once took to her\\n      lounge and remained there two years longer. About that time other advice\\n      was urged and gladly acceded to, with the result that the case was\\n      diagnosed by an eminent surgeon as spinal paralysis in consequence of\\n      concussion, though it could never be shown when and where it occurred.\\n      Salves, plasters, anodynes, nervines, and electricity did no good, but\\n      effectually destroyed appetite and digestion, which higher to had been\\n      normal. So this adviser resigned in favor of a third, who, being a younger\\n      and less prejudiced man, agreed perfectly with the writer\\'s original\\n      opinion. He advised return to moderate exercise, avoidance of drugs, and\\n      less display of sympathy. This, though formerly rejected as\\n      \"unkind,\" was now acceded to as coming from a nerve- specialist,\\n      fresh from Europe, at that time very rare. Still attending the other\\n      members of the family, the writer had sample opportunity of observing the\\n      course of the case. Improvement was very slow and uncertain till financial\\n      misfortune overtook the family. Almost with a bound our patient left her\\n      cough, and, organizing a kindergarten, strove energetically in supporting\\n      herself and assisting her mother. The change came about in less than three\\n      weeks, and resulted in perfect recovery.\\n      \\n At this point another very instructive\\n      case of very speedy recovery, after six or seven years of neurasthenic\\n      prostration, deserves to be mentioned. A woman of 35 had been in bed and\\n      on the lounge most of the time for nearly seven years, at the end of which\\n      time she became my patient, her regular medical attendant having gone to\\n      Europe. She was of very amiable disposition and as sensitive as she was\\n      weak. Her symptoms, as in the other cases, were instantaneous exhaustion\\n      on the least physical exertion. She could give herself up to no mental\\n      occupation beyond directing her house-hold affairs, the education of her\\n      son, and the rehearsal of her numerous sensations. She had not been my\\n      patient long when her husband failed in business, so that the family was\\n      reduced from very comfortable circumstances to a condition which made it\\n      necessary for the patient to make her own living and that of the family.\\n      This she almost at once proceeded to do, setting aside all other\\n      considerations and establishing a boarding-house, where she did most of\\n      the work herself. This she has done now for ten or twelve years without a\\n      serious relapse. The time involved in the period of convalescence was\\n      scarcely more than three weeks, a although her work maybe said to have\\n      begun at the moment her resolution was taken.\\n      \\n Prognostics.-From these and other cases\\n      in and outside of the writer\\'s practice, it is safe to say that the\\n      majority of cases of neurasthenia recover, though years may elapse before\\n      that period. We learn, furthermore, that recoveries, especially of very\\n      inveterate cases, depend on conditions beyond the control of the\\n      physician, as was the case in the above-recorded instances, where\\n      circumstances forced the patient to cases to wish for recovery and to make\\n      an effort of the will. This having been once accomplished self-confidence,\\n      for a long time in abeyance, was permanently restored.\\n      \\n Curability, further, depends very much\\n      on the temperament of the patient, whether amiable, tractable and\\n      confiding in the honest endeavors of the physician, or whether refractory,\\n      suspicious, untruthful, selfish and antagonistic, of a disposition\\n      impossible to win over on account of unnatural distrust of every\\n      well-meaning person. The degree of intelligence of patients also has a\\n      pronounced influence on the result. The most readily curable cases are\\n      those acquired without hereditary predisposition, where the cause is found\\n      in the absence of food and sleep, also where sorrow and anxiety can be\\n      averted or counteracted by judicious conduct of near relatives and\\n      friends.\\n      \\n Dietetic Treatment.-This, as medicinal\\n      treatment, must be governed by the stage at which the case comes into the\\n      physician\\'s hands-whether yet in its prodromal, its acute or its chronic\\n      phase. The prodromal stage of the disease has no very decided\\n      pathognomonic signs. The most that can be recognized in this stage is that\\n      the patient\\'s habits or duties are of a kind which will eventually lead to\\n      obdurate neurasthenia if not arrested in time by removing the exciting\\n      causes. Too much pleasure, as well as too much care, especially in girls\\n      and woman, tends to neglect of food and rest, in the absence of which,\\n      excitements, whether of pleasure or care, begets a state of unrest in\\n      which repose is disagreeable. With such a condition comes a list of\\n      incipient casual complaints of headache, imperfect sleep, notional ways of\\n      eating, working or playing. A few questions will determine whether the\\n      patient is living according to normal or abnormal habits with regard to\\n      appetite, sleep and occupation. Where these are found, their alteration to\\n      normal ways must be instead on. It is unnecessary to say that this is\\n      easier said than done, for it will probably meet with serious objections\\n      on the part of the patient, if not on that of her relatives; for most\\n      likely she has examinations for college to prepare for, involving several\\n      months of dose and careful study at night, and the patient cannot waste\\n      time in sleeping and eating while cramming that little excited and\\n      ambitions brain. A failure in the examinations would be as much of a\\n      disappointment to parents as to patient, who proves, as usual, that this\\n      appellation is a misnomer. She accordingly goes in as she please, lied by\\n      an increasing morbidly ambitions impulse, and the result is likely to be\\n      the mournful satisfaction on the part of the physician of being obliged to\\n      say, \"I told you before what would happen.\" Of course, all\\n      regret the now evident nerve-prostration, while, if the doctor had\\n      succeeded in enforcing his rules, he would in many cases experience the\\n      still more painful reproach of having been too severe. Nevertheless,\\n      absolute firmness and a kindly but unflinching exertion of his will,\\n      without the least compromise, reward the physician with the best results\\n      in such cases.\\n      \\n When the case, after the stage of\\n      excitement and untiring restlessness (at which it would still be speedily\\n      curable by simple dietetic rules) has, after weeks or months, entered upon\\n      the phase of painful prostration, here we encounter backache, oppressive\\n      headache, and absolute loss of mental or bodily endurance, measures of\\n      dietetic management are much less effective and much more difficult to\\n      find. it is at this stage that slight rise of temperature will occur,\\n      especially towards evening; then the backache and headache disappear, the\\n      pallor is replaced by a flush of color, the eyes lose their listless look,\\n      and the patient is inclined to enter upon some diversion or excitement,\\n      followed by a restless night and a morning of exhaustion and a renewal of\\n      all painful sensations. Most of such patients feel much better in the\\n      evening when they are ready for some entertainment, while in a normal\\n      state this would be the time for relaxation and repose.\\n      \\n The dietetic treatment of this stage is\\n      methodical rest. In severe cases the patient will do well to remain in bed\\n      for several days or even for weeks. It is well to shorten this period as\\n      much as possible and to insist on walking about, or, at least. sitting for\\n      a specified time every day. This may be varied b equally specified periods\\n      of rest in the recumbent position.\\n      \\n Irregularities of eating are at this\\n      and at all times to be superseded by the most rigid regularity of meals.\\n      The traditional and conventional three-meal system, however well adapted\\n      to the needs of a vigorous man or woman, does not agree with the\\n      neurasthenic patient. It is much better that these should eat oftener;\\n      four times a day is best in most cases, for the simple reason that in this\\n      way a patient, while eating less at a time, consumes more food in the\\n      aggregate.\\n      \\n As neurasthenic patients are rarely\\n      troubled with absolute aversion to wholesome food, they are generally able\\n      to consume a liberal quantity, about which it is only needful to remark\\n      here that the food should be selected from among the articles and dishes\\n      which the patient likes, provided they belong to the order of good, normal\\n      articles of food, to the exclusion of those which simply please the taste\\n      without being digestible. A dish entirely of meat or \"animal\\n      food\" is as far from being a good diet for neurasthenics as one\\n      consisting entirely of \"vegetable\" food. As a rule, the diet\\n      list should comprise one-third of nitrogenous material and two-thirds of\\n      carbohydrates. Together with these, it is a great mistake to neglect the\\n      fats, such as good butter and the fats of meats. And, lastly, every\\n      patient of this kind should be made to drink some water often, a dietetic\\n      feature too often neglected.\\n      \\n During this stage, actually fatiguing\\n      exercise of body and mind should be avoided, while, on the other hand, the\\n      patient\\'s mind should be directed away from herself, in which she is much\\n      assisted by withholding a certain kind of emotional sympathy, quite as\\n      natural as it is difficult to repress on the part of affectionate persons.\\n      Of this, a few words further on.\\n      \\n There is no definite time for the\\n      duration of this stage, which, however, depends largely on the time during\\n      which the exciting causes have acted, either aided by or without a\\n      predisposition. It is certain, however, that the sooner it is recognized\\n      and the exciting causes eliminated, so much the sooner recovery will\\n      begin. But there is a stage at which the best of experience and judgment\\n      often fail, especially in very inveterate cases. If the case is one of a\\n      patient whom the physician has had opportunity of watching at least since\\n      the earlier stages, the difficulty is not so great as it is in old cases\\n      months or even of several years\\' duration which come to treatment late. In\\n      these, the line between the intermediate stage and incipient convalescence\\n      cannot be drawn. The patient is as neurasthenic and hypochondriacal as\\n      ever; cannot bear the slightest mental or bodily exertion, not even a word\\n      or a look, without sings of apparent exhaustion, while nearly the whole\\n      time is spent in bed under anxious care of sympathetic attendants. In such\\n      cases, having become assured, by careful physical examination, of the\\n      absence of organic disease, seeing the patient generally well nourished\\n      and in fair muscular condition, the physician is warranted in assuming\\n      that the disease has run its course, that whatever morbid (pathological)\\n      process there may have been progressing in the nervous system, this\\n      process has now come to and end, but it has left the patient\\'s mental\\n      condition habituated to the moods of the past months or years, and fixed,\\n      as it were, indelibly in the memory. It is the habit that now remains, not\\n      the disease.\\n      \\n If reasonably sure of this, and calling\\n      to mind the rapid recoveries and the circumstances attending them, as\\n      above detailed, the physician is now safe in ordering a more energetic\\n      treatment, calculated to rouse the self-reliance of the patient. All\\n      visible signs of sympathy must now be set aside; the actins and demeanor\\n      of the attendants should, from this time, if not before, be changed so as\\n      to give the patient the impression that she is no longer an invalid, but\\n      expected to rely on her own exertion. Instead of being fed, the food\\n      should be placed where she must go for and eat it. She should now be\\n      expected to dress and attend, without assistance, to her natural wants.\\n      This, with some temperaments, is almost impossible, with al extremely\\n      difficult. The best course to pursue is to remove such patients from\\n      sympathetic relatives or friends, and to place them in charge of kind,\\n      reliable, but eminently practical nurses.\\n      \\n The first effect of this is either to\\n      throw the patient into a stage of helpless despondency, which, again\\n      appealing powerfully to the sympathies of those nearest to her, often\\n      frustrates the physician\\'s plans which, if firmly but kindly adhered to,\\n      would, ere long, prove of their superiority by signs of returning\\n      self-reliance and absence of complaints on the part of the patient. A\\n      second form of effect is that occurring in patients of obstreperous,\\n      selfish disposition, whose opposition and even anger is aroused by being\\n      thrown on their own resources after the removal of depressing and\\n      unpractical sympathy. This opposition or temper, often manifested in all\\n      sorts of intrigues and subterfuges on the part of the patient, if not\\n      supinely yielded to by sympathetic persons, will finally be replaced by a\\n      more rational disposition. On the whole, anger or active opposition are\\n      signs of returning energy, which, once coming to the consciousness of the\\n      patient, takes the form of self- reliance. it is this way that the cures\\n      of chronic cases above related can be explained, and physicians should\\n      profit by such experience for the benefit of their patients.\\n      \\n The general dietetic management now\\n      readily follows from what has been said, and needs only a few general\\n      modifications. The first duty of the physician will be to test the degree\\n      of reliance to be placed on the patient and her friends, ad to win them\\n      over if possible to his plans, and his success will be in proportion to\\n      the degree of confidence he is able to inspire. This personal confidence\\n      should not degenerate into a mere personal liking or attachment of a\\n      sympathy-craving neurasthenic who should discover henceforth that all\\n      sentimental expressing of sympathy are about to take a practical form,\\n      aiming at a definite result-the patient\\'s health-which she wishes but\\n      cannot exert her will to attain. The best and often the only way to do\\n      away with sentiment and to reach practical kindness is to remove the\\n      patient from certain home influence, and to place her in a hospital or\\n      elsewhere under the management of competent nurses who, without being\\n      selfish, know how to exert a certain amount of wholesome push as fast as\\n      the patient can bear it. Without the removal of sentimental sympathy, all\\n      efforts at counteracting the purely hypochondriacal side of neurasthenia\\n      are useless.\\n      \\n In these cases of neurasthenia as yet\\n      uncomplicated with the hypochondriacal element of introspective nosomania,\\n      there is only one unconditional rule to be followed, especially in\\n      acquired cases whose evident cause was incessant, conscientious work of\\n      mind and body, together with insufficient food and sleep. Such cases come\\n      on very insidiously, the loss of strength-that is, the actual waste of\\n      nerve-substance-being just a trifle grater than the quantity restored, the\\n      patient unconsciously using up a minute part of her capital every day.\\n      Here the rule should be to reverse matters to insuring a supply of\\n      nourishment and time for its assimilation greater than was the case\\n      heretofore. The case of young school-girls belong in this class. The time\\n      of food and rest should be carefully controlled at home, the duty of the\\n      physician being to educate indifferent and ignorant parents up to an\\n      appreciation of the nature of the case. It is generally not difficult to\\n      open their eyes through the medium of their anxiety concerning their\\n      children\\'s health. Having thus insured sufficient rest and food at home,\\n      the physician\\'s next object of attention should be the regulations of the\\n      school. Here is the point where teachers have an opportunity of exerting\\n      their most practical influence. It should be made obligatory on the part\\n      of teachers to institute inquiry as to whether pupils have had their meals\\n      before coming to school. This they could often ascertain without a\\n      question, by reading the pupil\\'s condition in her emaciated form, pale\\n      face and nervous manner. To guard against neglect at home, it would be an\\n      easy matter to insist that all pupils of public and private schools should\\n      bring with them some proper food. The few who do so generally bring\\n      sweets-an apple, orange or a few dry crackers-when a piece of good bread\\n      and slice of cold meat would be what they actually need. All pupils should\\n      pass inspection, and if remiss in this important particular, the\\n      delinquent should be dismissed with several marks against her. To expect\\n      this of teachers would be a great advance in the place of futile\\n      innovations of endeavoring to send forth from our common schools graduates\\n      in arts and sciences.\\n      \\n Sudden Effects.-A large number of cases\\n      of neurasthenia, especially those complicated with inveterate\\n      Hypochondriasis, are frequently traced to some sudden occurrence, having\\n      the effect of a mental or physical shock. In one patient, a vigorous girl,\\n      used to romping, climbing and running lie a boy, the cause was supposed to\\n      be a slight thump she received during a game of blindman\\'s-buff. She\\n      thought nothing of it at the time, but it was suggested long after the\\n      patient\\'s illness began. In another case some mental shock of joy or\\n      grief, not very severe and such as is often experienced in every person\\'s\\n      life, is the beginning of months of nervous prostration.\\n      \\n There is quite an array of evidence\\n      that neurasthenia which has entered upon a hypochondriacal stage or\\n      complication with or without a strong hysterical admixture, is curable by\\n      sudden impressions in the form of a shock, or more gradually by frequent\\n      repetitions of an impression. Such cases, as I have shown above, occur\\n      most commonly in the stage when what may be considered the essential\\n      pathological disturbances of function have run their course and have left\\n      the patient in a state of mental disturbance which indicated that the\\n      patient\\'s recovery depends entirely upon her volition. But there is none,\\n      and so far nothing has succeeded in arousing it. Persuasion is as useless\\n      and irritating, as argument would be in a case of insanity with a fixed\\n      illusion. The resemblance between this and the state of mind of a\\n      hypochondriacal neurasthenic is very close. She cannot move nor thick.\\n      Exhaustion overcomes her and keeps her its victim for years, when suddenly\\n      the scene changes, and a few days or weeks suffice to restore the patient\\n      to activity. In one instance it is attributed to medical, in another to\\n      \"mind cure,\" in a third to \"Christian science;\" in\\n      still other cases massage has done it, in others again \"magnetic\\n      influence,\" in others the very powerful factor necessity. It is\\n      certain that cases of this kind, produced by sudden effects on the mind of\\n      a predisposed person, are also cured by such effects. Whatever the visible\\n      form of these effects may be -whether that of \"Christian\\n      science,\" joy, grief or absolute inexorable necessity, there is\\n      always to be noticed a certain force and condition involving the modern\\n      idea of suggestion, which comes to the patient in an irresistible degree\\n      and now sets the function of the will in motion again.\\n      \\n Experience teaches that it is by no\\n      means a matter of indifference which of these forms of effect are brought\\n      into action. In one case it is the professional Christian scientist\\'s\\n      method, in another the almost brutal exertion of a person\\'s will combined\\n      with some physical force. In either case the patient is aroused from his\\n      inertia, and discovers his powers of mental and bodily ability to act.\\n      \\n A deplorable result is that recoveries\\n      after such effects are attributed in the popular mind to supernatural\\n      causes. That such is not the case may be gathered form instances occurring\\n      in very sensible and intelligent patients, whose reason is scarcely ever\\n      so far disturbed and weakened that they do not resent the proposition of\\n      trying, e.g., Christian science or mind cure.\\n      \\n Nevertheless, it is the mind cure which\\n      the intelligent patient needs quite as much as the ignorant and\\n      superstitious person; the difference is only the form in which the\\n      influencing force is applied. While in one case it is obedience to the\\n      candidly expressed instructions of the physician, in the other case the\\n      result is the to mystification. In either case it is the powerful stimulus\\n      of hope and aroused confidence that recovery will be realized.\\n      \\n The definition of suggestion does not\\n      fully cover the meaning, because the influence employed is greater than\\n      mere suggestion. The physician\\'s plan of action should be straightforward\\n      assurance of recovery, a direct appeal to hope, and an unceasing endeavor\\n      to arouse the self-reliance of the patient, not so much by verbal\\n      exhortations as by a manner and department from which the patient learns\\n      more readily than from words what is expected. If the attitude of the\\n      physician is appreciated, and seconded by the relatives and attendants, a\\n      favorable result is much more certain to follow.\\n      \\n Hypnotism is not advisable. There are\\n      now existing ancient neurasthenic invalids dating from the times of\\n      spiritualism when they were famous \"mediums.\" Hypnotism weakness\\n      the will and nervous endurance, and produces a predisposition to emotional\\n      nervousness with an intractable erotic admixture. The suggestions sought\\n      to be instilled into a hypnotized patient amount to nothing. The mental\\n      influence of mystical treatment administered while the patients is awake\\n      is much more powerful in awaking hope and confidence than the uncertain\\n      effects of an abnormal state like that of hypnotism. Mystification, again,\\n      though sometimes unavoidable with the best intention, is less powerful\\n      than direct and intelligible encouragement. While resort to mystification\\n      should be shunned by reputable physicians, the question arises as to what\\n      shall be done with the many who, from lack of intelligence or education,\\n      are entirely beyond the reach of honest common sense, and who will persist\\n      in mystifying themselves, who remain neurasthenic invalids in spite of the\\n      best regulations of the physician, and who do not recover unless their\\n      encouragement follows some mystical formalities which alone arouse their\\n      \"faith\" and finally their confidence and will-power. For the\\n      present there is no way out of the dilemma but to submit such patients to\\n      the suggestive methods of what is popularly known as mind cure and\\n      Christian science. In doing so, physicians should use their influence as\\n      far as possible in selecting the most honest persons of this class.\\n      \\n DISCUSSION.\\n      \\n JAMES C. WOOD, M.D.: I have nothing but\\n      words of praise for Dr. Wesselhoeft\\'s excellent paper. It is very evident\\n      that the author\\'s inspiration came not from books but from actual contact\\n      with neurasthenic subjects, for the impress of originality is most\\n      conspicuous. It is a production which could only come from one of\\n      experience and from a reasoner. I consider it a most valuable contribution\\n      to the literature of that now most interesting subject,\\n      \"neurasthenia\".\\n      \\n The doctor, in his paper, has sometimes\\n      used the term \"neurasthenia\" instead of\\n      \"neurasthenia.\" The first of these means, according to Thomas,\\n      great nervous power or excitement; the second, nervous debility. I taken\\n      it from the context that the subject dealt with is neurasthenia. To the\\n      average mind there exists what seems to me a needless confusion regarding\\n      the terms, nervous prostration, hysteria and hystero-neurosis. As I\\n      understand these terms they define distinct conditions, though there is a\\n      frequent blending the one with the other. The term nervous prostration,\\n      which is a synonym of neurasthenia, defines itself; the term hysteria\\n      should be restricted to those general neuroses characterized particularly\\n      by psychical manifestations, though not infrequently by motor, sensory,\\n      secretory, vasomotor and reflex derangements as well; while the term\\n      hysteroneurosis implies the uterine origin of symptoms manifesting\\n      themselves in organs remote from the uterus without structural changes in\\n      such organs, being the direct result of reflex nervous influence starting\\n      from the uterus. The last term does not occur in the paper under\\n      discussion. From the standpoint of a gynecologist I think that this is\\n      misleading.\\n      \\n Let us see why and how it is that these\\n      three conditions (I will not call them diseases) are so frequently\\n      associated. I think that all will admit the frequent occurrence in woman\\n      of reflex symptoms, the result of pelvic lesions. An irritation staring\\n      form the pelvis is conveyed to the genito-spinal centre, thence to any or\\n      all organs with which this centre communicates. The organ oftener involved\\n      than any other is the stomach. This is shown by the frequent occurrence of\\n      nausea and vomiting following conception. The nervous system may have been\\n      previously involved, but oftener it becomes so only after the nutrition is\\n      depraved, which, sooner or later, occurs if the pelvic lesion is not\\n      removed. The depraved blood fails to supply the nerve centres with that\\n      which they need to sustain them, and they become anaemic. Prostration is\\n      but a subjective manifestation of the anaemia, and it varies in degree\\n      from a slight indisposition to the most abject helplessness.\\n      \\n If, then, nervous prostration may have\\n      its beginning in a pelvic lesion, is it possible for a pelvic lesion to be\\n      inaugurated by systemic disturbances? Personally, I believe that it is,\\n      and offer this explanation as the modus operandi by which such a lesion is\\n      induced: Marked circulatory changes nearly always attend nervous\\n      prostration. The circulation is presided over by the vaso-motor system,\\n      and wear and repair depend upon the proper regulation of this system. If\\n      it becomes disturbed, the bloodvessels dilate or contract unduly, with\\n      resulting local hyperaemia or local anaemia, as the case maybe. The\\n      climacteric flushes are the result of such disturbance. The alternate\\n      coldness and heat of the extremities, so often associated with rectal and\\n      uterine lesions, is another familiar illustration. If the brain is\\n      involved, either insomnia or drowsiness occur, depending upon whether the\\n      brain is anaemic or hyperaemic. Flatulence, gastralgia, and nervous\\n      dyspepsia result when the stomach is similarly affected. The womb and the\\n      ovaries, because of the periodical congestion imposed upon them, are\\n      oftener implicated by these unnatural circulatory disturbances than any of\\n      the pelvic organs, and in time also become unduly hyperaemic or anaemic,\\n      as the case may be.\\n      \\n It will thus be seen that nervous\\n      prostration may exist independently of pelvic lesions, or, conversely,\\n      pelvic lesions may exist independently of nervous prostration.\\n      Nevertheless, the two are frequently associated, and this fact ought, I\\n      believe, to be kept in mind in dealing with the affection known as\\n      neurasthenia. Hysterical manifestations nearly always come to the surface\\n      in nervous prostration, and they also frequently attend pelvic lesions.\\n      Indeed, the term \"hystero-psychosis\" has been coined for the\\n      purpose of defining certain psychical disturbances of presumably pelvic\\n      origin, and in the broadest sense neurasthenia is not uncommonly an\\n      hysteroneurosis. It is the frequent association of these three conditions\\n      which, it seems to me, makes it more practicable to study them conjointly.\\n      \\n The special symptoms of nervous\\n      prostration are most variable. Introspection, as Dr. Wesselhoeft has\\n      pointed out, makes of the patient a nosomaniac. The anaemic nerve centres\\n      are unduly impressionable, and a mental shock which would not seriously\\n      affect a stronger and more rugged woman falls with crushing force upon one\\n      whose nutrition is already depraved. In this way are developed disorders\\n      of sensibility, alternations of mobility, circulatory disturbances,\\n      anomalies of secretion and exertion, disorders of the gastro-intestinal\\n      canal, dermatoses, and general and psychical disturbances of all kinds.\\n      Many of these affections start from pelvic lesions, and are nearly always\\n      associated with depravity of nutrition and more or less nervous\\n      prostration.\\n      \\n Some of the worst symptoms of\\n      neurasthenia with which I have had to contend have been hyperaesthesia of\\n      the articulations, giving rise to the so-called \"hysterical\\n      joint.\" Here the prostration is usually not profound, and it is\\n      possible to apply the somewhat energetic treatment recommended by Dr.\\n      Wesselhoeft. I remember one case very distinctly, the detailed history of\\n      which I shall give in another place, which brought me much reputation\\n      because of the \"remarkable\" cure I was fortunate enough to make.\\n      \\n The patient, a beautiful girl of\\n      eighteen, had been bed- ridden for three years with supposed hip-joint\\n      disease. She was in college before assuming the ride of an invalid, and\\n      worried much over her studies and work. She sustained a fall a short time\\n      previously to taking to her bed, and to this fall the injury to the hip\\n      was attributed. She had been from physician to physician and from\\n      sanitarium to sanitarium without receiving benefit. All of the numerous\\n      medical men under whose care she had been, directed their attention to the\\n      hip and applied the classical treatment for morbus coxarius without avail.\\n      The patient had finally reached a point where introspection was her chief\\n      occupation and her mind dwelt almost continually upon a \"diseased\\n      hip.\" She was finally brought to me, coming in an invalid\\'s chair and\\n      looking the very picture of dependency. There was a slight degree of\\n      anaemia, though this was not marked. Notwithstanding the expression\\n      expression of abjectness the girl did not look seriously ill. The hip was\\n      excessively tender upon pressure, but there was no local increase of\\n      temperature, no evidences of fever and suppuration, and forcible\\n      apposition by striking the heel was not very painful. More less spastic\\n      contraction of the flexor muscles of the affected side existed, which gave\\n      to the limb an appearance of actual shortening, which was very deceptive.\\n      Hysterical symptoms were common. On examination I found the left ovary\\n      exquisitely tender. Compression of the ovary increased the pain in the hip\\n      most decidedly and gave rise to much nervous agitation. I did not,\\n      therefore, deem it wise to recommend local treatment other than the daily\\n      use of the hot douche. She had long been a victim of ovarian\\n      dysmenorrhoea. I placed upon the ankle of the affected limb three pounds\\n      of bar-lead, prescribed a pair of crutches and insisted upon her walking.\\n      The lead was used to overcome the spastic contraction as well as for its\\n      moral effect. I did not deem the joint lesion of such a character as to\\n      used extension. In two months\\' time this patient discarded her crutches\\n      for a cane. Six weeks later she put up the cane and is now perfectly well.\\n      \\n This was a case in which somewhat harsh\\n      measures were eminently appropriate.\\n      \\n In marked contrast to the case just\\n      recorded is the following: Mrs.-, aet. 47, widow for twenty years. She is\\n      a devoted church-woman, and for years was a leader in all charitable work\\n      done in the community in which she resided. Through friends she was urged\\n      to consult me, and I think that the call to the neighboring town in which\\n      she lived was countermanded at least four or five times before the finally\\n      mustered up courage and strength enough to see me. Upon reaching the\\n      bedside I found my patient in a room made dark by closed blinds, over\\n      which were hung heavy blankets to shut out every ray of light. The mirror\\n      was turned toward the wall for fear a ray of light might strike it and\\n      flesh throughout the darkened room. Nor did the patient rest under these\\n      extreme precautions, for the eyes were protected with two pairs of colored\\n      glasses with side attachments. Hyperaesthesia of the sense of hearing was\\n      equally marked and the noise was excluded from the room by double doors\\n      whose keyholes were stuffed with cotton. She l so had her ears filled with\\n      cotton, over which she wore ear-mufflers. She was emaciated to an extreme\\n      degree, and had been reduced to her miserable condition by a series of\\n      events which frequently precede profound neurasthenia. Her husband was\\n      killed during the war, and she was left childless. Twelve months previous\\n      to taking to her bed she nursed her mother through a long and fatal\\n      illness. This greatly prostrated her, yet she kept up until a favorite\\n      brother-in-law was thrown from a carriage and killed. This was the last\\n      straw, and the shock compelled her to take to her bed. In due time loss of\\n      appetite with irritability of the stomach developed, which, of course, led\\n      to marked depravity of nutrition. With the anaemia came hyperaesthesia of\\n      the special senses, spinal irritation, headache, hysterical\\n      manifestations, etc. There was no series pelvic lesion, although she had\\n      been much treated for an alleged uterine displacement with congestion.\\n      Unfortunately, she was encouraged, instead of discouraged, in her\\n      invalidism, and she soon became a nosomaniac of the worst type. She had\\n      written down her symptoms one at a time, and the record is such a typical\\n      one that I should like to give it in full, but time forbids.\\n      \\n With great difficulty the patient was\\n      moved on a cough to a private hospital and placed under the Weir Mitchell\\n      treatment. I ignored the pelvic trouble entirely. It is unnecessary to\\n      give in detail the progress of the case from day to day after this\\n      treatment was inaugurated. Suffice it to say that the improvement was of\\n      the most marked character, and in six weeks from the time she entered the\\n      hospital she walked to her carriage with her eyes and ears unprotected.\\n      She soon resumed her church and charitable work, in which she again takes\\n      much delight.\\n      \\n This woman wanted to get well. She was\\n      a woman of pure motives and high ideals. She had, in the language of Dr.\\n      Wesselhoeft, the wish, but, unaided, not the will. She required the aid of\\n      an intelligent, strong-minded, nurse who could bring to her exercise\\n      applied in such a way as to enable her to assimilate food without the\\n      expenditure of nerve force. She co- operated with her physician and nurse\\n      in every possible way, and as soon as the anaemic nerve cells became\\n      flushed with new blood she began to improve. To have commanded this\\n      patient \"to take up her bed and walk\" before improving her\\n      nutrition would have been as unscientific as to have placed the first\\n      patient in bed with extension and counter-extension applied to the limb. I\\n      know of no class of cases requiring for their successful treatment more\\n      tact and discrimination than that under consideration.\\n      \\n I feel confident that I have many times\\n      cut the affection short in its prodromal stage by removing the girl from\\n      college work and insisting upon open-air exercise. Static electricity has,\\n      in my hands, proved exceedingly useful both during the prodromal stage and\\n      that of convalescence.\\n      \\n I will conclude by saying that I have\\n      been impressed with the frequency with which an hereditary history of\\n      epilepsy has been met with in the cases of neurasthenia passing under my\\n      observation.'\n",
      " 'Tresorie - SOME OF THE DISEASES PREVENTING AND COMPLICATION PREGNANCY\\n[Diseases Preventing & Complicating Pregnancy]\\n\\n STERILITY.-DeSinety, Treub, Furbinger,\\n      et al., attribute 50 per cent. of unproductive marriages to the husbands,\\n      saying that sterility in the male is more often the cause of barren\\n      marriages than is generally supposed.\\n      \\n This cause of sterility I pass by, as\\n      also sterility due to mechanical obstruction, incomplete ovulation and the\\n      numerous other causes of this condition, too manifold for mere\\n      enumeration, to consider obesity as a causative agent in this condition. I\\n      need not say that the advocates for surgical interference for the relief\\n      of this condition are legion. Sims makes the assertion that sterility can\\n      be cured by surgical means only. That, of course, is Allopathic arguing\\n      pure and simple. Cases requiring surgical interference do arise, but any\\n      treatment which raises the nutrition of the entire organism, improves the\\n      blood-formation, and favors the resorption of pathological products in the\\n      sexual organs, is to be regarded as the indicated remedy.\\n      \\n Published statements are my authority\\n      for saying that excellent results have followed the administration of\\n      drugs, nevertheless; and in complete defiance of all therapeutic measures,\\n      a certain percentage of women remain barren; for with the more occult\\n      causes of sterility we remain, as yet, unacquainted, consequently they\\n      cannot all be reached with say kind of treatment whatever.\\n      \\n The following case I report somewhat in\\n      detail. Whilst not an exceptional case at all, it bears directly upon the\\n      subject under consideration, and possesses, it seems to me, some decidedly\\n      interesting features. My object in selecting this particular one is to\\n      call attention, if possible, to a condition not sufficiently considered.\\n      Mrs. J., aet. 26, married about two years and a half, appealed to my\\n      knowledge for a reason as to why she remained childless. The lady was\\n      carrying an excess of flesh, being under the medium height, and weighing\\n      186 pounds, but appeared to be in good health; family and previous history\\n      all that could be desired. Examination showed none of the common causes of\\n      sterility; neither, so far as I could ascertain, was the husband\\n      responsible for this unproductive condition of affairs. Some previous\\n      experiences of my own, with the added testimony of other and able men, was\\n      my reason for charging this condition of things to the excess of flesh,\\n      this, by the husband, being laughingly charged to excess of laziness.\\n      \\n We all, undoubtedly, are familiar with\\n      that peculiar disease of the blood-corpuscles which, whilst producing\\n      flesh, relaxes at the same time the muscular force; acting also, I\\n      believe, upon the muscular fibres of the uterus and upon the ovaries,\\n      inducing not only serious menstrual disorders but sterility. McKee,\\n      Philbert, and others give several instances of sterility chargeable to\\n      obesity, the women in question having been married several years without\\n      bearing children, and all became mothers after losing a portion of their\\n      flesh. If any other argument were needed in support of this theory we\\n      might turn to the quadrupeds, where we find the poorest breeders among the\\n      fleshiest animals. Fournel has a very able treatise on \"The Effects\\n      of Obesity on the Menstrual Functions and Parturition.\" Without\\n      having had any actual case of this description to deal with, he inclines\\n      very strongly towards the belief that obesity favors sterility. In the\\n      treatment of the case before mentioned, the patient was subjected to a\\n      daily massage of the entire body, with a special pelvic massage three\\n      times a week. This, in the main, consists in elevating the uterus as high\\n      as possible with the finger in the vagina, ending with a quick and decided\\n      vibratory motion. The diet received particular attention, as at this time\\n      there was a slight gastric ailment. The indicated remedy, Thuja, was given\\n      in the minimum dose. At the end of three months almost thirty pounds of\\n      flesh was gone, a considerable reduction. As an experiment, I recommended\\n      coitus in the knee-elbow position, advising that the lady remain quiet as\\n      long as possible after coition, with thighs well flexed. She became\\n      enciente, but miscarried at eight weeks. There was, comparatively\\n      speaking, but little pain and not much subsequent haemorrhage. She made a\\n      rapid recovery. Since then a living child has been born to them.\\n      \\n I believe I am safe in saying that this\\n      result would hardly have obtained were it not for the prophylactic\\n      measures adopted.\\n      \\n At the end of the first two months the\\n      patient was attacked with haemorrhage. A similar occurrence took place at\\n      irregular intervals during the following five months, the quantity of\\n      blood lost being much greater than that at the normal menstrual period.\\n      \\n For the greater part of the last five\\n      months she kept her bed, at the end of which time the tendency of the\\n      uterus to empty itself could be resisted no longer. A seven months\\' child\\n      was born, and is to-day doing well.\\n      \\n Pseudocyesis cerebral pregnancy,\\n      phantom pregnancy (whatever name we may call it by) is a disease which\\n      must come under the head of those \"complicating pregnancy.\" Mrs.\\n      M., a lady, married two or three years, aet. 29.

When I first saw the lady in question she\\n      was a perfect picture of health, and, according to appearance and her own\\n      statements, about seven months pregnant. I made no examination. This\\n      appeared to be a thoroughly intelligent woman, and, according to her own\\n      statement, there was cessation of the menses. There certainly was an\\n      enlargement of the abdomen and breasts, a milky secretion, and the lady\\n      was sure that she felt foetal movement. On February 28th of the present\\n      year I was called to attend her in labor. Examination showed that no\\n      pregnancy existed. So far as I could ascertain there was no assignable\\n      origin for this condition other than nervous influences, the phenomena\\n      being purely muscular distension of the abdomen.\\n      \\n Mayham reports a case of a woman 73\\n      years old, claiming to be pregnant; he also claims that subsequently she\\n      was delivered of a child; this is an Allopathic report, however, of which\\n      we will take a Homoeopathic dose. Haultain reports three cases of cerebral\\n      pregnancy. In the first, he says no cause whatever was to be found; in the\\n      second, there was a small fibroid growth in the anterior uterine wall.\\n      Hauck reports a case where the vomiting, peristalsis, and flatus, caused\\n      by alcoholism were supposed to be caused by the pregnant state. Such cases\\n      are uncommon, but they emphasize the importance of making a thorough\\n      examination, in all cases where positive information is desired of the\\n      existence or non-existence of pregnancy.\\n      \\n Hyperemesis Gravidarum.-An animated\\n      discussion, held recently between two celebrated Allopaths of Stuttgart\\n      and Leipsic, has served to awaken a renewed interest in this subject,\\n      without in the least adding anything new to our stock of knowledge\\n      regarding its aetiology. Notwithstanding the frequency of the vomiting of\\n      pregnancy, its very distressing character in many instances, and its\\n      imminent, its very distressing character in many instances, and its\\n      imminent danger, we find but very few contributions of any value, to\\n      either the aetiology of the disorder or its therapeutics. I do not expect\\n      to add anything specially new myself, but it does seem to me that our\\n      knowledge of the vomiting of pregnancy, is to say the least, in a most\\n      contradictory state. Some physicians look upon it as a trifling matter,\\n      others as a thing to be endured, and some-these are in the right too-view\\n      even the mildest cases with gravity. Even in the mildest cases of morning\\n      sickness there is a constant drain upon the nervous system, putting the\\n      sufferer into a condition, in which she is very much less able to endure\\n      parturition than she would otherwise have been.\\n      \\n Dr. Harrison Mettler says: \"After\\n      careful inquiry I find that women who suffer from much morning sickness\\n      have as a rule, tedious or otherwise troublesome labors. I have observed\\n      in multiparae that at one time they will have much nausea and vomiting\\n      followed by a difficult labor, while at another time they will be quite\\n      free from the vomiting, and will pass through the succeeding labor with\\n      comparative ease.\" I must say my observations make me agree with Dr.\\n      Mettler entirely; when one thinks how rapidly the mildest of cases assume\\n      pernicious forms, indifference is certainly no longer to be excused. There\\n      is a voluminous literature upon this subject, and many and varied are the\\n      aetiological reasons given for this very variable affection, a large\\n      majority of writers coinciding in the opinion that \"many causes\\n      operate together,\" to produce what we are pleased to designate the\\n      \"vomiting of pregnancy.\" I believe myself that in a large\\n      percentage of cases, this pernicious vomiting is simply the result of a\\n      reflex neurosis. Undoubtedly uterine displacements frequently cause\\n      vomiting; but when this is so, and the displaced organ is raised by\\n      packing the vagina with aseptic wool, the vomiting ceases.\\n      \\n Lillie reports a number of cases, where\\n      obstinate vomiting was caused by a retroflexed uterus, and restoration of\\n      the organ caused a cessation of the disorder. Bezugloff having a\\n      persistent case of morning sickness, introduced a bougie it no the uterus,\\n      the intention being to produce abortion; the immediate result was a\\n      stoppage of the vomiting, and the pregnancy went on to full term.\\n      \\n In the case just cited, I must say that\\n      I believe it was the fright, caused by the thought of abortion being\\n      performed, more than the effects of introducing the bougie, which operated\\n      so successfully; I say now, as I said before, I believe that the\\n      pre-eminent cause of this kind of sickness must be looked for i the\\n      nervous system. Flint speaks of this form of sickness as being decidedly\\n      neurotic in its origin, and cites a number of cases of a chronic variety\\n      of dyspepsia frequently occurring in young girls. I had one such case come\\n      under my personal care. There was a persistent morning sickness, with this\\n      young lady, and a disagreeable nausea whenever food was taken; this\\n      patient was at some distance from her home, in a boarding school, and she\\n      will probably never know that the lady principal entertained very grave\\n      thoughts at one time in regard to her virtue. It certainly was very\\n      difficult to differentiate between this and the vomiting of pregnancy; it\\n      was, however, simply due to a vitiated nervous system. My theory is\\n      supported by Alt, who records a number of such cases; I cite one only, the\\n      case being that of a highly hysterical woman, six months pregnant,\\n      suffering from the gravest vomiting, and anxious that miscarriage be\\n      induced. She was making preparation for entering the hospital for this\\n      purpose, when one of her children was seized with pneumonia. The anxiety\\n      felt over the child, forced all thought of self from the mother\\'s mind;\\n      from that moment the vomiting ceased and she remained well until the\\n      termination of pregnancy.-Minchener Medicinische Wochenschrift.\\n      \\n Whilst saying that I believe this\\n      disease to be in the majority of cases of purely nervous origin, I would\\n      not imply thereby that it is not to be feared, far from it; if neglected,\\n      we know how likely it is to pass quickly beyond treatment and our patient\\n      succumb from sheer exhaustion.\\n      \\n In the treatment cited such as\\n      insertion of bougies, dilation of the os, pelvic massage, etc., I believe\\n      it is merely the \"doing something,\" no matter much what it is,\\n      so long as you have gained the confidence of your patient, that does good.\\n      We have seen how suddenly Hyperemesis will cease if the patient be\\n      alarmed; it may be, has often been, and will to again, cured by a process\\n      skin to suggestion. Kattenback had a case where the patient, a primipara,\\n      was seized with an incorrigible vomiting. It was suggested to her that her\\n      stomach contained some lumps of unwholesome material and their removal\\n      would cure her. Some milk was given her, and the stomach ceremoniously\\n      washed out. its contents bore no indications of either over-acidity or\\n      abnormal ferment She was informed that she was all right and the vomiting\\n      would not return; neither did if, and she was safely delivered at term.\\n      \\n There is a familiar and now well-know\\n      phenomena, by which these neurotics can be influenced; I speak of\\n      hypnotism; it is due to purely subjective conditions.\\n      \\n There is an identity of the hypnotic\\n      susceptibility with the condition of hysteria, and it is along these lines\\n      that we can work. Just as many times as I have tried this method of\\n      treatment, for these cases of excessive vomiting, just so many times has\\n      it given me gratifying results.\\n      \\n The patient can be to sleep by\\n      bi-ocular pressure, and the idea of cure suggested; the operation may have\\n      to be repeated several times, at intervals of a day or so, but you will be\\n      rewarded by the cessation of the vomiting, often with but one suggestion.\\n      Where the patient is not easily controlled by means of the bi-ocular\\n      pressure, Luy\\'s revolving mirror is a never failing resource.'\n",
      " 'Tresorie - PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS [Presidential Address]\\n\\n THE ROLE OF HOMOEOPATHY IN THE SECOND\\n      \\n By ALVA BENJAMIN, M.B.CH.B., F.F.HOM.\\n      \\n Such a system of medicine must\\n      recognize that it is as much an art as a science, and that healing is a\\n      relationship between two living personalities. It must recognize too, that\\n      the sick individual has to take an active part in his treatment and not be\\n      merely the passive recipient of this or that treatment. For just as it is\\n      rightly said that man does not live by alone, so should it be emphasized\\n      that man cannot be cured by medicine alone. He must see to it himself that\\n      he lives as far as possible a physically and psychically healthy life.\\n      Indeed, each individual has a power within himself to help in his own\\n      cure.\\n      \\n Do the official schools of medicine\\n      teach such an art today? I am afraid not: they are so intent on seeking\\n      the specific treatment for this or that named disease or the antibiotic\\n      that will most effectively put out of action the organism regarded as the\\n      cause of the disease, that they are losing sight of the individual\\n      himself.\\n      \\n But Homoeopathy in its persistent\\n      search for the reactions of the individual to his environment in the\\n      broadest sense, no matter of what the patient is complaining surely\\n      fulfills these requirements, especially when it is recognized that the\\n      homoeopathic potencies do not anything to the patient as do the drugs of\\n      the dominant school, but rather stimulate the patients own recuperative\\n      powers to overcome the infection or re - establish the normal metabolism\\n      which has become deranged by the illness.\\n      \\n When you consider how the homoeopathic\\n      physician diagnoses the individuality of his patient over and above the\\n      name of the disease from which he is suffering, and uses for the purpose\\n      of his prescription rather than the name of the disease this personal\\n      diagnosis of the patients mental and emotional reactions, his responses to\\n      changes in weather conditions, the alternations in his environment which\\n      influence his symptoms, etc., one realize how very individualistic is the\\n      Homoeopathic prescription fitted to that particular patient.\\n      \\n The homoeopathic physician does not\\n      seek for a remedy specific to any named disease and which he can thus\\n      apply almost automatically once he has made his organic diagnosis, which\\n      in quite an appreciable number of instances may ultimately be found to be\\n      wrong and so the treatment based upon it must therefore have been wrong.\\n      He does not, as is so often done, merely suppress the most outstanding\\n      symptom by an appropriate drug; for example giving an anodyne to mask the\\n      pain or removing the skin eruption by some strong local application, in\\n      other words putting the dust under the mat and pretending the room is\\n      clean.\\n      \\n Strangely enough the homoeopathic\\n      physician is often accused by his allopathic critic in his ignorance of\\n      Homoeopathy, of merely treating symptoms, whereas it is the critic himself\\n      who practices this superficial medicine. The homoeopathic physician, on\\n      the other hand, treats his patient as a whole through his symptoms and\\n      their modifications through changes in the environment, which is quite a\\n      different matter.\\n      \\n Homoeopathic therapy, unlike methods of\\n      treatment, is based on a natural law \"Similia Similibus\\n      Curentur\" \"Likes may be cured by likes\" which has been\\n      proved time and time again by experiment and which anyone with the will to\\n      do may prove for himself. It is not subject to constant change brought\\n      about by this or that latest discovery, and which itself will soon have to\\n      give way to the still later idea.\\n      \\n Having now introduced to you our actor,\\n      what of the scene in which he is to play his role?\\n      \\n This is the nineteen hundred and fifty\\n      - fourth year of the Christian era and the second year of the reign of our\\n      much loved and admired young Queen Elizabeth II, who will remember while\\n      in south Africa on her twenty - first birthday, before she had any idea\\n      that she would so soon be called to such an exalted position as she holds\\n      today, broadcast to the commonwealth and Empire her resolve to dedicate\\n      her life to the service of this grand community which dedication she\\n      recently repeated at her Coronation.\\n      \\n Here in Great Britain we have a more or\\n      less complete welfare state, with which idea some of us may very strongly\\n      disagree, whilst others believe such a development is the result of a\\n      natural very desirable social evolution.\\n      \\n As one necessary ingredient of this\\n      welfare state came, in 1948, the initiation of the National Health\\n      Service, through which the great majority of the population receives its\\n      medical attention, although it is rightly available to all.\\n      \\n When we come to consider the role that\\n      homoeo - therapeutics should play in this scheme, I would suggest that we\\n      should regard the problem from the purely medical aspect, forgetting any\\n      political party allegiances or sympathies we may have; or if we cannot\\n      forget them we should remember that the organization of the National\\n      Insurance Scheme of which the National Health Service is but a part, was\\n      first blue printed by the well - known Liberal supporter, Lord Beveridge,\\n      and the Health Service plans developed by the Coalition Government of all\\n      three major political parties.\\n      \\n We are living at present in an age\\n      which may very justifiably be regarded as a violent age in which have been\\n      developed so many appalling instruments of destruction, the use of some of\\n      which we are quite complacently accepting and from the use of others we\\n      are refraining, not because we consider them immoral, but simply through\\n      the fear of the wholesale destruction which would be caused by their use.\\n      We are seeing X-rays used in very high voltages in the treatment of\\n      cancer, we are being constantly remained of the use of dangerous drugs in\\n      medicine, without justification, in my opinion, bearing in mind the\\n      doubtful and evanescent ameliorations they produce and the violent\\n      surgical treatment of mental patients.\\n      \\n One further violence we should not\\n      forget is the way some of our foods are devitalized by the extraction of\\n      this or that portion of the natural product for purposes quite foreign to\\n      the well - being of the people who are to feed on them; or they are\\n      contaminated by the addition of this or that dangerous chemical, either\\n      during the growing of the plant, in the form of sprays, or as so called\\n      improvers in, for instance, the manufacture of white bread. It is very\\n      significant in this regard that quite a lot of attention is paid to the\\n      protection of the man who sprays the crops, but the right of the consumer\\n      to have uncontaminated food is slurred over by the unjustifiable statement\\n      that the amount of these chemicals so consumed is so small that it cannot\\n      have any bad effect on the consumer. We who practice Homoeopathy know how\\n      unwarranted is such a statement.\\n      \\n Can we homoeopathic physicians and\\n      patient hope to be able to do anything to make the still small voice of\\n      Homoeopathy heard in all this tumult, so that we may return to a saner and\\n      more healthful way of life and help our young Queen in her lifes work for\\n      the communitys sake?\\n      \\n Can we expect any help from the leaders\\n      of the medical profession? I am afraid not, because although I believe it\\n      accurate to state that there is a very slowly growing interest in, and\\n      tolerance of our work by individual doctors, the medical authorities are\\n      still, in their prejudice, strongly opposed to us. The London University\\n      still refuses to recognize our Hospital as a post - graduate teaching\\n      Hospital: the British Medical Association prohibits the formation of a\\n      homoeopathic section of its organization, and the Royal College of\\n      Physicians still refuses its membership to any one known as a homoeopathic\\n      physician. Yet in spite of this unfavourable environment, I firmly believe\\n      that there is a future for our method of therapeutics: but it will have to\\n      be pursued with courage, determination, foresight and energy. Surely if we\\n      believe as I do, that we are the guardians of a system of treatment\\n      destined to make our people healthier and therefore more efficient and\\n      happier, we would be failing in our duty to our country if we did not take\\n      every means in our power to acquaint the community at large with the\\n      advantages of this system and the dangers of ignoring it. This is a duty,\\n      not only of the profession, but also of the laity interested in\\n      Homoeopathy and who have experienced its benefits.\\n      \\n Every physician has two professional\\n      obligation to the community, that of preserving its health and that of\\n      endeavouring to restore it to being when it has fallen by the way.\\n      \\n The homoeopathic physician, thorough\\n      his knowledge acquired through the provings of drugs, even in\\n      infinitesimal doses, has, I believe, a very special responsibility as\\n      regards the prophylaxis of disease. It seems to me that a great deal of\\n      chronic ill health may quite conceivably be due to the manipulations of\\n      our foods and to the artificial manuring of the ground in which many of\\n      them are grown. Experiments have been carried our proving that plants\\n      grown in soil enriched by natural manuring, are much less prone to\\n      diseases than those grown with the help of artificial chemical manures. It\\n      seems a fairly justified conclusion that vegetables grown under these\\n      artificial conditions may quite well be deficient in something necessary\\n      for our perfect health. It is therefore incumbent upon the physician to\\n      advocate whenever possible the ingestion of healthily grown foods in the\\n      widest sense of that term.\\n      \\n The same duty applies when we consider\\n      the great amount of drugging in which the community at large indulges by\\n      its excessive smoking, particularly when aggravated by the practice of\\n      inhaling, and by the continued and prolonged use of drugs for this or that\\n      symptom, too often, unfortunately, though not always, on the prescription\\n      of their medical advisors.\\n      \\n There is a great lack throughout the\\n      community of any real enthusiasm for perfect health: we are only too prone\\n      to be content to follow like sheep, the unintelligent and harmful\\n      practices of the majority of our fellows.\\n      \\n Similarly in the curative realm, we\\n      homoeopathic physicians have special obligations.\\n      \\n When considering our position vis-a-vis\\n      the rest of the profession, we must never lose sight of the fact that our\\n      approach to the sick individual is a much broader and more comprehensive\\n      one than that of the dominant school. This latter prides itself on its\\n      scientific approach to its problems. One must, however, always be on ones\\n      guard against being hypnotized by that word scientific. The scientific\\n      aspect of any phenomenon or problem dealing with humanity is only one\\n      limited aspect of that problem. To get a complete picture one must\\n      consider other aspect, such as the aesthetic, emotional, maybe religious,\\n      and above all, perhaps one might say embracing all, the philosophical\\n      approach. This complex approach to his patients problem is the one that\\n      the homoeopathic physician always strives to adopt, and so never loses\\n      sight of the ego of the patient, while at the same time not forgetting his\\n      physical make - up.\\n      \\n Because this approach of ours to our\\n      patients is a much broader and more comprehensive one than the much\\n      vaunted scientific aspect, which the dominant school has come to regard as\\n      the Ultima Thule of medicine, I deplore the oft - repeated request of some\\n      of my colleagues that we should forsake our philosophy and make our work\\n      as scientific as theirs. I do not mean to imply by this that we should\\n      neglect the scientific angle of our patients illness but we should always\\n      remember that is only one facet of our problem. That is why we take such\\n      pains to diagnose our patients personality with his reaction to his\\n      environment in addition to the physical diagnosis of the case in order to\\n      arrive at our prescription for his malady. In other words, we should\\n      endeavour to lead our dominant school colleagues to our way of thinking,\\n      rather than that we should adopt theirs.\\n      \\n At the same time must always remember\\n      that if our philosophy should seem at any time to contradict so - called\\n      scientific laws, we must re - examine our philosophy, and if necessary\\n      modify it, while at the same time remembering that many times in the past\\n      what have been regarded as laws have ultimately been proved not to be so.\\n      Thus it is evident that we must never relax our self - examination.\\n      \\n What shall be the role of the\\n      homoeopathic laity?\\n      \\n The first thing for them to remember is\\n      that we are living in a democratic country whose government is dependent\\n      on the goodwill of the governed, and that, if a sufficient number of\\n      voters desire a certain line of action, that line will be adopted by the\\n      government.\\n      \\n The second thought is that there are\\n      not nearly sufficient doctors practising Homoeopathy in Great Britain to\\n      satisfy the present demand, let alone any further increased demand in the\\n      future, for this line of treatment.\\n      \\n Does not this seem strange, having\\n      regard to the great advantage to humanity that Homoeopathy provides? Not\\n      if one looks below the surface and so finds the reason for this shortage.\\n      \\n Surely the most potent reason is that\\n      Homoeopathy is not taught in the official Medical Schools, either as a pre\\n      - or post - graduate study. The London University when asked to recognize\\n      the Royal London Homoeopathic Hospital as a post - graduate Medical\\n      School, refused on the plea that as Homoeopathy was not taught in the\\n      undergraduate Medical Schools, it could not find a place for it in its\\n      post - graduate curriculum.\\n      \\n It is, of course, nonsense to suggest\\n      that a graduate should pursue his studies only in those subject of which\\n      he had already obtained some knowledge in his undergraduate days and\\n      should not wish to obtain information on any new or extra subject.\\n      \\n The University Medical Shools are\\n      enabled to a great extent through Government grants. We must therefore\\n      find some way of influencing whatever Government be in power to bring\\n      pressure to bear upon the London University to remove this obstacle to the\\n      better health of the community at large. I am quite satisfied that once\\n      this academic recognition is obtained we shave many more post - graduate\\n      students of Homoeopathy.\\n      \\n I believe than in a democratic\\n      community, having a universal State Medical Service, it is the bounden\\n      duty of the Government to remove all obstacles to the peoples obtaining\\n      that form of medical treatment in which they have confidence. So long as\\n      Homoeopathy is denied its legitimate status, so long must be Government be\\n      deemed to b failing in its duty to the country.\\n      \\n If, however, we are to achieve this\\n      desirable object of full recognition, we must all, professional and laity,\\n      be fired with enthusiasm, not only for the abstract cause of Homoeopathy,\\n      but for being partners with our young Queen in delicating our lives to the\\n      community.\\n      \\n When we do this we shall help to make\\n      this second Elizabethan era one to be remembered throughout the ages to\\n      come as surpassing the first Elizabethan era in that it gained not so much\\n      the economic and political leadership of the world - though that is not to\\n      be despised - but showed the way to the most healthful and spiritual way\\n      of life that all the world look notice and followed suit.\\n      \\n To sum up, the Role of Homoeopathy, as\\n      I see it, is to humanize the practice of medicine. By that I mean it must\\n      bring the practice of medicine into line with a reasoned philosophy of\\n      life, restore to it its artistry and rid it of all unnecessary hazards. It\\n      is to do this, not from any abstract academic sense of superiority, but in\\n      order the years to come are not those of merely another reign, but to\\n      ensure a veritable Renaissance, starting with the second Elizabethan era\\n      in which Great Britain will take its rightful place in the comity of\\n      nations as the pathfinder to a way of life for which posterity will be\\n      able to say \"Thank God for Queen Elizabeth the Second and her\\n      peoples.'\n",

Lafield, who was Professor of\\n      Roentgenology at the Yale Medical School.\\n      \\n Some of the reasons why roentgen\\n      pelvimetry has not been more universally adopted are probably due to the\\n      following factors.\\n      \\n (1) The majority of women will be\\n      delivered normally, whether or not pelvic measurements are made.\\n      \\n (2) The medical profession does not\\n      readily accept a new method after an established satisfactory routine has\\n      been in use.\\n      \\n (3) A new method of diagnosis incurs\\n      added expense.\\n      \\n (4) The present methods, although\\n      entirely speculative, are satisfactory in most cases.\\n      \\n (5) Roentgen pelvimetry cannot be\\n      performed by the obstetrician himself but requires the aid of a\\n      roentgenologist.\\n      \\n (6) The value of roentgenometric\\n      diagnosis is recent in origin and as yet not universally accepted.\\n      \\n If the knowledge of the size and shape\\n      of the pelvis is necessary to the practice of obstetrics, roentgen\\n      pelvimetry is a sound procedure, particularly in pre-emptors patients, and\\n      should and should be considered as an indispensable aid in these cases.\\n      \\n The method of Herbert Thoms as\\n      developed at Yale Medical School is not the only method. However, it can\\n      be classified as simple, accurate and rapid; being adaptable for use by\\n      other than experts in x-ray and obstetric diagnosis. As a technical\\n      procedure a well trained hospital technician can master its technic alter\\n      sufficient instruction.\\n      \\n Studies of recent years reveal the fact\\n      that external Pelvimetry fails to give uniform and accurate information in\\n      regard to the shape and size of the superior strait. This is often true of\\n      thin undersized individuals. In many patients of this type external\\n      measurements may suggest a contracted pelvis while the x-ray will show a\\n      relatively large pelvis with a subsequent natural labor and normal-sized\\n      child. On the other hand a stocky short person with similar external\\n      measurements will disclose a contracted pelvis which is an obstetric\\n      problem. Because of the apparent relationship between shortening of the\\n      transverse diameter and a secondary persistent occipito-posterior\\n      presentation, accurate information regarding this diameter is of clinical\\n      significance.\\n      \\n The observations of Thomas were made on\\n      twenty consecutive patients whose pelvis showed a relative or real\\n      shortening of the transverse diameter of the superior strait. In every\\n      instance a primary or secondary occipito posterior position was found\\n      after the patient was in labor. (Herbert Thoms, Surgery, Gynecology and\\n      Obstetrics, January, 1933). It therefore has been proved that an actual or\\n      relative shortening of a transverse diameter of the superior strait\\n      results in a limitation of space that is greater in the anterior than in\\n      the posterior half of the superior strait. Under these circumstances, when\\n      the head descends early in labor, the occiput is forced to rotate\\n      posteriorly.\\n      \\n The x-ray offers additional information\\n      in determining the size of the fetal head. It has been noted in x-ray\\n      examination of the unengaged fetal head that it lay with the transverse\\n      diameter of the superior strait, the occiput being either to the right or\\n      left; therefore, if roentgenogram of the patient is taken in the supine\\n      position with the fetus in the uterus, it will cast a shadow which is an\\n      enlarged profile of the head. The measurements of the occipital frontal\\n      diameter of the head can then be made. On numerous occasions this method\\n      of cephalometry, determining the diameter of the unmoulded head before and\\n      after cesarean section, has yielded accurate results. (Thomas, A.M.A.,\\n      February 24, 1934).\\n      \\n As experience increases in roentgen\\n      pelvimetry, the so-called labor test will be employed less. This, however,\\n      does not mean that the physician should not under estimate the importance\\n      of uterine contraction and the ability of the fetal head to mold. It has\\n      always followed that when something could be proved desirable in medicine\\n      for the better protection of the patient, such an advance would be\\n      demanded and eventually become routine. We may concede, therefore, that\\n      roentgen pelvimetry has a distinct place in the examination of every\\n      primiparous woman. In many instances, according to Thomas and others,\\n      external; measurements were normal but the x-ray examination revealed a\\n      contracted pelvis. On the other had, in certain patients whose external\\n      measurements suggested a cesarean section roentgen pelvimetry proved\\n      otherwise and they were subsequently delivered in a normal manner.\\n      \\n CENTIMETER GRID METHOD.\\n      \\n The procedure in this method may be\\n      summarized by stating the following:.\\n      \\n (1) The patient is placed on the\\n      roentgenographic table in the semi- recumbent position.\\n      \\n (2) The level of the superior strait\\n      above the sensitized film is established.\\n      \\n (3) The tube target is centered about\\n      five centimeters posterior to the symphysis, at thirty-two inches from the\\n      sensitized film, The exposure is made.\\n      \\n (4) The patient is removed from the\\n      table, the tube target and sensitized film remaining in situ.\\n      \\n (5) A lead plate, or centimeter grid,\\n      with perforations exactly one centimeter apart, is introduced into the\\n      same plane as that previously occupied by the superior strait and a second\\n      (flash) exposure is made on the same sensitized film as was used used in\\n      the previous exposure.\\n      \\n (6) Development of the film shows the\\n      outline of the superior strait and the shadows of the perforations, the\\n      assistance between which represents centimeters in the plane of the\\n      superior strait. The anteroposterior and transverse diameters of the\\n      superior strait in its use proportions may be drawn on centimeter-square\\n      paper by following the course of the shadow of the superior strait and\\n      transcribing it.\\n      \\n As this time I wish to express my\\n      thanks to Dr. Thoms for his personal advice and instruction which helped\\n      me to master the technic of his method.'\n",

      " 'Tresorie - THE EFFICACY OF THE VIBROMETER IN APPLYING VIBRATORY MASSAGE\\nIN AURAL DISEASES [Efficacy Of Vibrometer In Applying Vibratory Message In Aural\\nDisease]\\n\\n SINCE presenting my paper before the\\n      American Institute, in June of last year on \"Vibratory Motion as a\\n      Method of Massage in Aural Diseases,\" I have been using an instrument\\n      specially devised for that purpose called the \"vibrometer.\" This\\n      instrument is in shape like a banjo, and has four strings stretched across\\n      its length resting on a bridge, which sets upon a diaphragm. On each side,\\n      elevated above the diaphragm and supported by posts, are two horizontal\\n      bars, which support the mechanical appliances used for producing the\\n      various vibratory motions. This consists in what is called a yoke, in\\n      which revolves a shaft connected with the electro-motor by pulley-wheels\\n      and a belt. Behind the diaphragm is a shallow air-tight compartment,\\n      leading from which are rubber tubes that are inserted in the external\\n      auditory canal during treatment, consequently any vibratory motion of the\\n      diaphragm, which must necessarily be an inward and a corresponding outward\\n      movement, would be exactly reproduced upon the membrana tympani, as the\\n      confined air, not being able to escape, will undergo an alternate\\n      condensation and rarefication in the external auditory canal.\\n      \\n Every vibratory movement of the strings\\n      of the instrument is communicated to the diaphragm by means of the bridge\\n      upon which it rests. These strings by varying their tension and length can\\n      be regulated to give a high or low rate of vibration as desired, for\\n      instance, the heaviest string left at its original length adjusted to a\\n      slight tension may make about fifty vibratory motions to the second, while\\n      the highest string on the instrument adjusted to a high tension and\\n      clamped down to one-fourth its original length would probably make three\\n      thousand vibratory motions to the second.\\n      \\n In the centre of the diaphragm is an\\n      attachment which works on a lever, and when hit by the cam on the\\n      revolving shaft lifts the diaphragm to a considerable extent, causing a\\n      powerful effect on the membrana tympani. This attachment can be adjusted\\n      at four different leverages, which causes a modification or increase of\\n      its intensity and can be regulated at from one to twenty-five vibratory\\n      movements to the second. This is only used in very bad cases and for not\\n      more than five minutes continuously.\\n      \\n The instrument which I have been\\n      describing in an improvement on the first manufactured, and as far as I\\n      know, is the only one which offers the same facilities for applying this\\n      method of massage. The class of patients in my experience who are\\n      generally benefited from the first, are those in which the mucous membrane\\n      lining the tympanic cavity and Eustachian tubes is in a hypertrophic\\n      condition. The membrana tympani are depressed, opaque, and thickened. They\\n      usually complain of a stiffed sensation in the ears, with a great deal of\\n      tinnitus aurium, and that their hearing is worse during a cold. In cases\\n      where the mucous membranes are atrophied with a large external auditory\\n      canal perfectly dry and Eustachian tubes patulous, and generally very\\n      little tinnitus, this or no other treatment has done very much good in the\\n      majority of cases, and in looking ever my records I find that only about\\n      five per cent. have been relieved, while in the before-mentioned cases the\\n      good results reach at least seventy-five per cent. In treating persons, I\\n      always select the rate of vibration which corresponds in pitch, if\\n      possible, to that caused by the diseased condition of the ears. If there\\n      is no tinnitus to guide me, I find whether the patient can hear a high or\\n      low sound better; if it is a low sound, a high rate of vibration is used\\n      in treatment, and vice versa, A point which I would like to explain here\\n      is this: It is not necessary that the sound from the instrument should be\\n      of the same quality of the tinnitus experienced by the patient, but merely\\n      the same pitch. for instance, if a banjo, where one of the strings was\\n      adjusted when sounded to produce a certain note, and a musical instrument\\n      of any other kind, whose quality of tone was entirely different, was made\\n      to sound the same note in a room, the string on the banjo would vibrate in\\n      sympathy, which has been proven by experiment, any other note, no matter\\n      how loud, would have no effect. Another point is in the way the strings of\\n      the vibrometer are set in motion. On the revolving shaft is a wheel\\n      projecting from which are metallic picks which hit the string it is\\n      adjusted over. It does not make any difference in the number of vibratory\\n      motions per second, whether the string is hit fast or slow, but at the\\n      time the string is first hit the intensity is greater than it is just\\n      before being hit again, and as the motion of the wheel is perfectly\\n      rhythmic, revolving so many times to the second, it has just as good an\\n      effect as if the intensity during the fraction of a second did not vary at\\n      all. The idea of using vibratory motion, as I have said before, originated\\n      within my mind some years ago, and later put into practical operation, and\\n      as far as I know, was the first to lay before the profession in a\\n      scientific manner, this method of massage.\\n      \\n I have found that when two of the\\n      strings upon the vibrometer were regulated in such a way that when both\\n      were set in vibration at the same time, producing the sensation of a\\n      harmonious sound, the effect in some cases on the tinnitus was especially\\n      beneficial, relieving, where the various kinds of vibrations produced by a\\n      single string failed. Sub-acute cases of deafness, accompanied by tinnitus\\n      aurium, are quickly relieved, as the following case will illustrate:.\\n      \\n Mrs. M. Young, married lady, aet. 26,\\n      called at my office, April 1, 1893, complaining of partial deafness and\\n      tinnitus aurium. She had a stuffed sensation, or as if cotton had been\\n      packed in the external auditory canal. She says the tinnitus was so\\n      annoying as to prevent sleep. On examination, found considerable\\n      retraction of the membrana tympani, and hearing for the watch, on the\\n      right side five inches, on the left, seven inches. The Eustachian tube\\n      were partially closed, which made inflation somewhat difficult, giving\\n      slight relief. I used several of the vibrations on the different strings\\n      without immediate benefit.\\n      \\n April 4th.-She came again, and reported\\n      that no improvement had taken place. I again inflated her ears, after\\n      which she sat down to the vibrometer. The central attachment was used with\\n      considerable force continuously for four minutes, after which she declared\\n      that the tinnitus had entirely ceased in the right ear, and greatly\\n      modified in the left; the hearing for the watch had increased for both\\n      ears to fourteen inches, and the stuffed sensation had almost entirely\\n      disappeared. On inspection of the membrana tympani, found them\\n      comparatively very slightly retracted. On April 8th, found improvement had\\n      continued, when the same treatment was used for three minutes; after which\\n      she declared herself completely relieved of the tinnitus and stuffed\\n      sensation, with hearing powerfully restored. Saw her again on April 13th,\\n      when she declared the good results from last treatment to have still\\n      continued.\\n      \\n I find that in the majority of cases,\\n      when the strings of the instrument are used it is only necessary to strike\\n      them lightly with the friction wheel. In vibrating the heavy string, I\\n      generally set the bridge back behind the central attachment, and adjusting\\n      the motor in such way that the belt is at a considerable tension, so that\\n      the pulley-wheel revolves slowly. I also generally use this adjustment\\n      when setting in motion two strings at one time. The principle of this\\n      method of treatment embraces two essential features which to my mind makes\\n      this system of massage the only scientific one applicable to the membrana\\n      tympani and its associate sound-conducting parts. Message is the\\n      application of motion to disease, and its scientific administration\\n      consists of its application in a systematic manner. In applying massage in\\n      aural diseases, it is necessary to produce a to-and-fro movement of the\\n      membrana tympani, and, if possible, by a force which is harmless and at\\n      the same time effective. The vibrometer fulfils these conditions. Any of\\n      the strings on the instrument that may be set in motion by the\\n      friction-wheel, will produce a certain number of vibratory movements to\\n      the second of time, and the movements of the central attachment are also\\n      measured. What could be more systematic than this? The motions of the\\n      membrana tympani were intended by nature to its vibratory, and as the\\n      vibrometer generates measured motion, and these motions are vibratory,\\n      theoretically we have a scientific and effective method of massage in\\n      aural diseases; and, as demonstrated practically by the use of the\\n      vibrometer, we have in fact a great scientific advance over all previous\\n      methods. Since the introduction of this treatment in aural diseases, it\\n      makes possible a more or less benefit in cases of deafness heretofore\\n      considered hopeless, and has opened up the field for the treatment of\\n      aural diseases to such an extent that the number of deaf patients seeking\\n      relief at the aurist\\'s hands will at least double itself.\\n      \\n DISCUSSION.\\n      \\n H.C. HOUGHTON, M.D.: Dr. Garey\\'s\\n      admirable paper gives us the description of the vibrometer, an instrument\\n      devised under his personal direction and inspection, for the purpose of\\n      applying massage to the ear. It is the only instrument of the kind on the\\n      market, so far as I am aware, and after a somewhat prolonged use of it, I\\n      am prepared to recommend the latest production of the vibrometer company.\\n      \\n This instrument is a decided\\n      improvement over the instrument first sent out, and is capable of\\n      producing a most profound effect upon the drum-head and ossicula; indeed,\\n      upon the entire auditory apparatus. I am able to confirm Dr. Garey\\'s\\n      statement of the effect of high and low vibrations us regards treatment.\\n      \\n I have also been very much interested\\n      in the use of stringed or reed instruments for diagnosis, and find that we\\n      can detect any abnormal sensitiveness of the auditory nerve to high or low\\n      tones. Some patients are extremely sensitive to all tones, high or low;\\n      others to high tones and not to low tones; others, conversely. Again, in\\n      some instances, there is a peculiar sensitiveness to single tones or to\\n      discords produced by sounding the note and half-note at the same time.\\n      Under the action of the central attachment of the vibrometer this\\n      sensitiveness is modified, the sensitiveness to high tones disappearing\\n      and being replaced by a low tone or, conversely, under treatment, a low\\n      tone disappears and a high tone is established, temporarily, at least.\\n      Again, in cases of recent origin, treatment will substitute an undefined\\n      rushing sound for a definite musical tone, either high or low, and later,\\n      the treatment will abolish this, the patient being relieved of this\\n      intensely annoying symptom. In some cases, with this relief, there is an\\n      improvement in the audition; in other cases, no improvement follows.\\n      \\n I confess to the domination of the\\n      material over my mind in my earlier experience with massage, and I think\\n      the inclination of operators will be to use a far greater degree of power\\n      than is necessary. I therefore notice with great satisfaction Professor\\n      Garey\\'s remark that \"the object should be to produce a to-and-fro\\n      motion to the membrana tympani, and, if possible, by a force which is\\n      harmless and at the same time effective.\" I would hardly say\\n      \"to-and-fro motion of the drum-head,\" because I think that the\\n      expression is liable to perpetuate the motion which is fixed in the minds\\n      of most physiologists, that the drum-head moves as a whole, with a\\n      to-and-fro motion.\" That is true under the influence of the Politzer,\\n      Siegle\\'s otoscope and similar instruments; but it certainly does not so\\n      move in the ordinary function of audition, but stands as the iris does in\\n      the eye, as an adjustor, a regulator of sound-force; in some sense as the\\n      iris does in its relation with the lens, to adjust, regulate and direct\\n      the essential force, and the vibration of the drum-head is at every node;\\n      every portion receives impressions that are converted into molecular\\n      disturbances of varying lengths, according as they are produced upon the\\n      stiff and unyielding portions of the drum-head at the periphery, along the\\n      manubrium, or in the more attenuated and easily-yielding portions which\\n      the between these two areas. Not only so, but these impulses are\\n      communicated to the contained air of the tympanum, and make their\\n      impression upon the acoustic nerve through the round window synchronously\\n      with the impression made through the ossicula.\\n      \\n This whole subject widens before my\\n      mind in such a way that one might wish himself twenty years and at liberty\\n      to devote himself to a term of research in acoustics, such as is offered\\n      only in the technical schools of the continent of Europe.\\n      \\n WM. R. KING, M.D.: In discussing Dr.\\n      Garey\\'s paper I shall begin by saying that his methods have been closely\\n      followed by me since the beginning of his experiments, owing to the fact\\n      that I have been greatly interested in the treatment of deafness and\\n      tinnitus by means of sound waves or by aural massage since 1887, and have\\n      experimented and treated many cases by this method since then, though with\\n      crude and unsatisfactory instruments. Since using the vibrometer-which,\\n      after much study and experimentation, is now presented to the profession\\n      in practical shape-I have undoubtedly increased my percentage of good\\n      results.\\n      \\n I don\\'t believe I am over-sanguine or\\n      carried away by interest in this method, and believe I can rightly\\n      appreciate that this does not offer us a panacea or cure-all for auditory\\n      ailments, and hope I may always be ready to see the failures and to strive\\n      to find methods or remedies to reach some of them.\\n      \\n In speaking of the application of the\\n      instrument, I wish to call attention to the central attachment or post foe\\n      vibrations. Dr. Garey has not given it as much attention in the paper as\\n      it deserves. It is very useful as a general means of aural massage,\\n      rougher in nature and more general in application than the strings which\\n      help to make up the instrument. I often use it before applying the\\n      \"similar found\" to a given case, as a species of gymnastics, to\\n      stimulate secretion and motion in the conducting apparatus of the ear,\\n      viz., membrana tympani and ossicles. In most cases-in fact, in all-where\\n      tinnitus is present, I follow this up immediately by the nearest approach\\n      to the similar pitch obtainable.\\n      \\n I agree thoroughly with Dr. Garey, that\\n      the best results are achieved in cases accompanying hypertrophic catarrh,\\n      and that the least benefit is apparent in cases of atrophic nature.\\n      \\n Regarding the method of treatment in\\n      the absence of tinnitus, my experience the does not coincide with that of\\n      the author of the paper entirely; I do not feel that as yet we have any\\n      safe rule to guide us. My method has been to try the numerous sounds and\\n      variations the of until I find the one that seems to give the best\\n      immediate results, or that the patient himself will speak of as very\\n      penetrating and powerful )though not necessarily loud and heavy).\\n      \\n It seems almost impossible at present\\n      to simulate all the qualities of tone as they occur in the ears of those\\n      suffering with tinnitus; in fact, it would appear to be unnecessary.\\n      However, it seems advantageous and quite necessary to secure the closest\\n      simulation of pitch, thus in many cases soon obliterating annoying\\n      tinnitus and improving hearing powers.\\n      \\n The arrangement permitting of the\\n      picking of two strings simultaneously adds decidedly the usefulness of the\\n      instrument, as it increases the range of pitch as well as varying the\\n      quality of tones procurable, thereby decidedly enlarging our field of\\n      application.\\n      \\n The force used for creating the message\\n      or gymnastics of the membrana tympani and the ossicles-viz, vibratory\\n      force or sound- carefully and scientifically applied, is nature\\'s remedy,\\n      because it is adapted by nature, and is the only force which can rightly\\n      or safely be applied to these delicate portions of this complex organ of\\n      hearing.\\n      \\n A startling commentary on this subject\\n      is the array of cases benefited who have been relegated to the shelf by\\n      ancient and modern otology; cases declared unhelpable have been vastly\\n      improved. Pray, make no mistake; I did not say all cases.\\n      \\n It may be interesting to hear the\\n      latest regarding the instrument which was first invented for the\\n      application of this method of aural massage Mr. E.J. Godman, the inventor\\n      and patentee, is constantly on the lookout, and always striving for\\n      improvements to his machine. He has made many that you all know of. Permit\\n      me to report a few so recent they have not yet left the factory.\\n      \\n First.-The machine has been taken from\\n      its case, and is now mounted on a solid stand or table of oak, being set\\n      below the level, or so that the face of the instrument is just level with\\n      the face of the table. This is all supported by rigid, solid metal legs,\\n      which absolutely prevent foreign vibrations.\\n      \\n Second.-The motor has been removed from\\n      its little shelf and relegated below the table. I t can be placed upon a\\n      box on the floor, a shelf against the wall, or, better yet, a shelf\\n      solidly attached to the metal supports of the table. A belt goes up\\n      through an aperture to a wheel on a shaft, the other extremity of which\\n      carries a wheel with a rubber tire (a friction wheel), which in its\\n      revolution, being in contact with a larger flat- surfaced wheel on the\\n      main shaft of the instrument, turns this in harmony with itself. This\\n      arrangement does away with the necessity of shifting the motor each time\\n      you wish to shift the carriage from one string to another- a consummation\\n      to be devoutly thankful for. The removal of the motor from the instrument\\n      as at present attached will recommend itself to all who have used the\\n      vibrometer, a great amount of undesirable jar being thus avoided.\\n      \\n Third.-Ratchet keys capable of very\\n      fine adjustment of tension of strings are now provided for the instrument.\\n      \\n Fourth.-A rheostadt or resistance-coil\\n      is now to be placed beneath the table between the storage battery and the\\n      switch, by this means enabling us to control the speed and number of\\n      revolutions to a nicety.\\n      \\n Other, though comparatively minor,\\n      improvements are being made, and others are contemplated, as, for\\n      instance, the substitution of a roughly corrugated rubber band for the\\n      picker on the wheel, thereby getting rid of the metallic sound of the\\n      picker on the wire strings.\\n      \\n I have experimented with a number of\\n      appliance for the production of the sounds and pitches that I have\\n      required, but I always fall back on the vibrometer, especially as at\\n      present constructed, for satisfactory work and results.\\n      \\n This instrument may be, and probably\\n      is, as yet, in its infancy. It, and the method it applies, can only be\\n      perfected by constant work and experimentation both on the part of the\\n      profession and of the manufacturers. Each improvement we can suggest, if\\n      it only should serve as a means of helping one solitary case, would be\\n      well worth our while.\\n      \\n The experiments being made by different\\n      methods for treating deafness by sound waves is indicative of the interest\\n      the profession has taken in the matter. It is indicative of a lack of\\n      something in our usual armamentarium which is greatly longed for by\\n      patient and doctor; that is, the means for making the deaf hear and for\\n      relieving distressing tinnitus. There has been a dearth in this direction,\\n      and perhaps there still is, but I believe fully that we have in aural\\n      massage by vibratory force a decided acquisition at our hands.\\n      \\n E. H. LINNELL., M.D.: I would simply\\n      like to ask Dr. King how long he uses the instrument, and whether he uses\\n      it according to the deafness.\\n      \\n DR. KING: Yes, decidedly. In an intense\\n      case of deafness I would have to use it a great deal longer. The central\\n      attachment I never carry over three or five minutes, and the whole\\n      treatment I don\\'t think is over carried over twenty or twenty-five minutes\\n      in one case, and usually averages from ten to fifteen.\\n      \\n HAROLD WILSON, M.D.: I have only to\\n      suggest, what I have elsewhere called attention to, the possibility of\\n      another mechanical device for securing vibratory motion. It is well known\\n      that in the make and break of a current of electricity, in the circuit of\\n      which there is a telephone, we get an influence upon the make and break of\\n      the current in the telephone. Now, it is a simple matter with which these\\n      makes and breaks are made as to obtaining any number of vibration that you\\n      wish. You may, by a mechanical device of some rotary motion, if you\\n      choose, make and break the current as rapidly as you please until you have\\n      reached several thousand vibrations a second, or you may even make the\\n      vibrations so slow us to be easily counted. The application of this\\n      suggestion has been put in force in my own practice, more or less, in the\\n      use of the telephone as connected with the induction-coil ordinary\\n      battery. The more intense the current, the more intense the sound. You can\\n      easily see that it is mere question of mechanics to secure these two\\n      sounds-intensity of vibration and rapidity of vibration. I will say,\\n      furthermore, that it has this advantage. There is no noise in the office,\\n      which I think is not altogether true of the vibrometer. I would suggest\\n      that so far as the vibrometer is concerned, if it could be made to be\\n      noiseless to anybody but the patient, it would be a decided improvement.\\n      In that respect the telephone is a decided improvement, because there is\\n      no noise except to the patient, because the noise is right at the ear of\\n      the patient. If I were seeking for a perfected instrument in this line, I\\n      would go outside of the banjo idea. As we have the most perfect writing\\n      machines, which have no connection with the ordinary method of writing,\\n      and sewing machines, which have no connection with sewing by hand, so it\\n      occurs to me that possibly the securing of he vibratory motion upon the\\n      ears might be obtained in a totally different way from that which you get\\n      when you listen to the drum of the guitar or an ordinary musical\\n      instrument, and I would suggest that the make and break of a telephone\\n      open a very fruitful field for mechanical experimentation.\\n      \\n H.C. HOUGHTON, M.D.: In my study of\\n      this subject I made the acquaintance of Mr. Bernhardt, of New York City,\\n      who is a personal friend of Mr. Emil Berliner, the inventor of the Emil\\n      Berliner Telephone, which is the instrument by which the Bell Telephone\\n      Company maintain their monopoly at present. Mr. Berliner is the inventor\\n      of the graphophone, and has, I think, covered this whole matter which Dr.\\n      Wilson has mentioned. As ordinary Bell telephone receiver is put into the\\n      circuit of an ordinary induction machine, and you can use it just as the\\n      English people use the audiometer, and as you remove the coil you modify\\n      the vibrations, which is covered with another disk and a tube, and that\\n      tube covered with a stethoscope tube, which is the same as we use for the\\n      phonograph or vibrometer, and, as Dr. Wilson has suggested, you can modify\\n      the intensity, and of course the whole matter is adjusted by the\\n      attachment of the cord, so that you can have fine vibrations. The\\n      intensity of the vibrations is regulated by the distance to which you\\n      uncover the cord. The only difficulty in the adjustment is that it has\\n      been so severe that it is really uncomfortable, and the noise of the\\n      instrument is reduced to the minimum for office use.\\n      \\n A.B. NORTON, M.D.: I will also add that\\n      in regard to the objection Dr. Wilson makes to the noise, there is no\\n      doubt it is an annoying thing in the office, and in that line I have some\\n      men at work on my suggestion. We are devising another machine, or\\n      instrument, which is to be entirely enclosed in a cabinet, so there will\\n      be no noise whatever in the room if it is made a success. The idea is a\\n      little crude, and I am quite uncertain whether it will amount to anything\\n      or not. Then, in the line of what Dr. King was speaking in regard to Mr.\\n      Goodwin-he called, at New York, to see me last week. I made two little\\n      suggestion to him, which I think would be in line with his advancement.\\n      One is the number of the picks. The present vibrometer has four picks I\\n      suggest the experiment of trying twelve or sixteen picks, which will make\\n      a more continuous sound; it may be of some value. Then, in regard to\\n      regulating the speed of the machine: you regulate that now by a series of\\n      buttons, so as to get three different speeds. We will have a very slight,\\n      intermediate speed, and a very rapid speed. My experience with the\\n      vibrometer is especially favorable. I think the idea is in the right\\n      direction, and it is simply a matter of instrumentation.']\n",

Dietary sources of vitamin C include fruits and vegetables, particularly citrus fruits such as oranges.Severe deficiency of vitamin C causes scurvy. Although rare, scurvy results in severe symptoms and can cause death. People with scurvy are treated with vitamin C and should be under medical supervision.Many uses for vitamin C have been proposed, but evidence of benefit in scientific studies is lacking. In particular, research on asthma, cancer, and diabetes remains inconclusive, and a lack of benefit has been found for the prevention of cataracts or heart disease.The use of vitamin C in the prevention or treatment of colds remains controversial. Extensive research has been conducted. Overall, vitamin C lacked an effect on the development of colds and on cold symptoms. However, the duration of the cold shortened slightly. Notably, people living in extreme circumstances, including soldiers in the subarctic, skiers, and marathon runners, had a 50% decrease in the risk of developing a cold. This area merits additional research and may be of particular interest to athletes or people in the military.'\n",

Vitamin B12 is frequently used in combination with other B vitamins in a vitamin B complex formulation. Vitamin B12 is important in DNA synthesis. Vitamin B12 is bound to the protein in food. Acid in the stomach releases B12 from protein during digestion. Once released, B12 combines with a substance called intrinsic factor (IF) before it is absorbed into the bloodstream.The human body stores several years\\' worth of vitamin B12 in the liver, so low levels in the body are rare. Decreases in vitamin B12 levels are more common in the elderly, HIV-infected persons, and vegetarians. Inability to absorb vitamin B12 from the intestinal tract can cause a type of anemia called pernicious anemia.

This is based on results. They are not\\n      hopeless cases; they are still hopeful and they get well under\\n      radiotherapy. This has happened during the last three years, not because I\\n      have changed any but because the method of radiotherapy has changed. A\\n      great change has taken place. First of all, radium and x-rays are no\\n      longer looked on a last resort.\".\\n      \\n The foregoing bears witness to the\\n      progress made in the field radiation therapy. The manufacture of more\\n      adequate apparatus and the improved technic in its use reflect this\\n      improvement. Machines are used generally delivering twenty to thirty\\n      milliamperes of current at 200 K.V., while machines operating at 750 to\\n      1,000 200 K.V., using lower milliamperes, have been installed in several\\n      places in this country. Since the question of increased voltages began to\\n      dominate the field, machines operating at 400 to 600 K.V., using sealed\\n      tubes, have been manufactured in this country as well as on the been\\n      manufactured in this country as well as on the continent. This higher\\n      powered machines occupy little more space than the usual 200 K.V. machine.\\n      \\n The effectiveness of these stronger\\n      radiations is thought to be due to (1) the increased penetration and its\\n      consequently larger percentage depth doses, (2) the supposed higher\\n      selective action of short have length radiation on malignant cells, and\\n      (3) greatly increased x-ray output. Clinics using super-voltages report\\n      that clinical results are somewhat better than those secured through the\\n      use of the lesser voltage machine.\\n      \\n Experimental effort, from the physical\\n      and biologic point of view, has been exerted to establish to standard\\n      basis for radiotherapy since Roentgens discovery thirtyfive years ago, and\\n      its application five years later. Radiotherapists have only recently begun\\n      to understand the principles of clinical application or radiotherapy in\\n      the treatment of malignant conditions.\\n      \\n Regaud selected the rabbits testicle\\n      for his experiments because its histologic cellular structure was highly\\n      sensitive to radiation, containing cells which are in a state of active\\n      mitosis resembling that of malignant tissue. In 1922, Regaud reported that\\n      of malignant, tissue. In 1922, Regaud reported that it was impossible to\\n      sterilize the testicle by a single dose of radiation without causing\\n      serious damage to the overlying skin. The dose required to produced such\\n      radio necrosis was equivalent to about three radionecrosis was equivalent\\n      to about three erythemas when administered in one dose. However, by\\n      dividing the dose in such a manner as to prolong the treatment over a\\n      period of fourteen days, a total dose of about five erythemas could be\\n      given causing complete sterilizations without damage to the skin. Thus it\\n      is seen that by prolonging the time of treatment the cutaneous dose could\\n      be increased nearly 50 per cent without causing necrosis.\\n      \\n The above experiments were reported,\\n      and the same results determined, by Schinz and Slotopolsky in 1926, and\\n      again by Regaud and Ferroux in 1927. These experiments formed the\\n      foundation for the clinical studies of Pfahler (America), Hohlfelder\\n      (Germany) and Coutard (France), who have swung the pendulum from massive\\n      radiation, as advocated by the German school, to that of the protected\\n      fractional dose method. Results have been achieved by this method which\\n      are superior to previously reported; these are obtained by the improved\\n      method of administering a large dose to the (3 days) without causing\\n      destructive effects to the surroundings normal structure (or cancer bed);\\n      its effect are rather biologic than physical. The clinical application of\\n      the method of radiation by Pfahler, Countard, and Berven (Sweden) in the\\n      treatment of cancer of the tonsil, pharynx and larynx and have proved the\\n      radio-sensitive properties of squamous carcinoma, previously considered\\n      incapable of of responding to radiation.\\n      \\n According to Coutard, the neoplasm is\\n      exposed to x-rays twice daily, giving a total dose of 350 r to400 r to two\\n      areas, using 190 to 200 k.v., four milliamperes, two millimeters of copper\\n      and three millimeters of aluminum filtration at a distance of fifty of\\n      sixty centimeters, for lesion of the head and neck. For deeply situated\\n      lesions, such as cancer of the uterus, the focal distance varies from 80\\n      to 100 centimeters, the area of the field for the head and neck conditions\\n      being only 50 to 100 square centimeters, while those of the lower abdomen\\n      require on an average of 250 to 300 square centimeters. For the\\n      sterilization of the radio-sensitive squamous carcinomatous growth, a\\n      depth dose of 3,000 r to 4,000 r is given, while stronger dose is\\n      necessary for the radio-resistant tumors.\\n      \\n In the course of treatment of principle\\n      guides a radio reaction of the covering epithelium and the radio reaction\\n      of the cancer cells. The radio reaction of the cutaneous epithelium is\\n      called \"radio epidermitis.\"characterized by loss of epithelial\\n      layers and denudation of the dermis. The reaction of the mucous membrane ,\\n      called \"radio epithelitis,\" manifests itself by loss of the\\n      epithelial layer sand denudation of the mucous membrane, epithelial layers\\n      and denudation of the corium which becomes covered by a fibrinous and\\n      false membrane; of clear. The duration of both describe radio reactions is\\n      six weeks. Each appears at the beginning of three weeks and disappears at\\n      the beginning of the ninth week.\\n      \\n Should the total or daily dose or the\\n      intensity per minute be too high, or the filtration or the tension too\\n      low, the cancer bed would be modified. the nutrition of the malignant\\n      cells becomes impaired The cellular radio- sensitivity, which seems to be\\n      linked up not only with the mitosis of the cell but above all with the\\n      activity of their interchange with the cell but above all with the\\n      activity of their interchange with the surrounding normal structures,\\n      becomes diminished and at times suppressed. The cancer cells become\\n      incentive to radiation. This phenomenon is called \"radio-\\n      vaccination\" by Regaud.\\n      \\n Observation of clinical facts shows\\n      that changes in the surrounding normal tissue result from excessive daily\\n      doses and intensity per minute per minute causing radio resistance of the\\n      tissue. Conversely, radio- sensitivity would be prolonged with a smaller\\n      daily dosage and the resultant extended period.\\n      \\n Realizing that better results may be\\n      obtained by prolonged treatment, Coutard and his collaborators in the last\\n      few years have begun to extend the duration of treatment of certain\\n      so-called radio-resistant cancers from thirty to ninety days, giving weak\\n      daily doses in order of about 175, 220, 225 and 250 r per day, dividing\\n      the dose in two treatments. By this method he was able to cure a certain\\n      number of lesions on which he had not been able previously to obtain the\\n      same results, such as very differentiated epidermoid epithelioma invading\\n      the muscles and cartilages, glandular epithelioma of the breast ad the\\n      thyroid body, and special round celled epitheliomas of the upper part of\\n      the ethmoid and the adjacent sinuses. This mode of prolonged treatment not\\n      only controlled the condition locally but it lessened the frequency of\\n      metastasis.\\n      \\n When radiating a cancer of very\\n      embryonic, very radio-sensitive growths, the energy factor is predominant.\\n      The action of the x-rays seems to be direct and rapid; the treatment can\\n      be accomplished within fifteen to twenty days. The cells are destroyed and\\n      generally normal structures are affected very little. When radiating the\\n      less embryonic type of growths, the time of treatment should be longer.\\n      \\n Pursuing these general principles, I\\n      have adopted the Countard method with some slight modifications. The cures\\n      which I shall illustrate will show that the percentage of cures in a\\n      number of most dangerous epidermoid carcinomas has markedly increased and\\n      that some conditions formerly considered hopeless have been temporarily\\n      cured. In conclusion I wish to emphasize the following facts:.\\n      \\n (1) Cure of cancer by x-rays is still\\n      difficult and must not be entered into lightly and causally.\\n      \\n (2) Radiotherapy is just as radical in\\n      method as surgery, and requires great skill, judgment and experience.\\n      \\n (3) The cooperation of the pathologist\\n      and the radiotherapist is imperative for a proper estimate of the\\n      radio-sensitivity in relation to treatment of the lesion.\\n      \\n (4) Daily examination of the patient is\\n      necessary; modification of the normal structure and general reaction by\\n      the x-ray treatment sometimes appears to quickly that it is often\\n      necessary to diminish the daily dose or the size of the field in the\\n      course of treatment.\\n      \\n (5) There exists no fixed method of\\n      treatment, only a simple clinical treatment for each individual patient\\n      and for the special type of tumor..\\n      \\n (6) Improvement in roentgen apparatus\\n      of higher voltages, producing more penetrating rays, will permit a better\\n      relation between destruction of malignant cells and preservation of the\\n      supporting, and the radio sensitivity of the tumor may be prolonged.'\n",
      " 'Tresorie - ALL INDIA HOMOEOPATHIC CONVENTION WELCOME ADDRESS [All India\\nHomoeopathic Convention Welcome Address]\\n\\n Mr. President, Friends and Colleagues.\\n      \\n It fills my heart with joy unspeakable\\n      to extend a hearty welcome to you all to this city at this All India\\n      Homoeopathic Convention held on the occasion of Bi-centennial Birth-day\\n      Anniversary of our great Master Hahnemann. This is the city where\\n      Homoeopathy was first introduced by Rajendra Lal Dutta of hallowed memory,\\n      who spent a princely fortune for dissemination of its principles and\\n      practice among his countrymen. This is the city where took place the\\n      dramatic conversion of one of the then medical luminaries of the first\\n      magnitude, to the practice of Homoeopathy under the influence of Rajendra\\n      Lal. I mean Dr. Mahendra Lal Sircar who became the high priest of\\n      Homoeopathy, spread its glory far and wide and gained thereby an\\n      international reputation for himself. This is the city where the\\n      celebrities of Homoeopathy like Dr. Berigny, Dr. Salzar, Dr. P.C.\\n      Majumdar, Dr. D. N. Roy. Dr. Younan, Dr. J.N. Majumdar, Dr. Baridbaran\\n      Mukherji, Dr. S.K. Nag, Dr. A.N. Mukherji, Dr. T.N. Palit, Dr. G.\\n      Dirghangi and a host of other talented physicians practised their\\n      profession with credit and success and held aloft the banner of\\n      Homoeopathy. This is the city where exist pioneer institutions for the\\n      teaching of Homoeopathy. This is the city wherefrom Homoeopathy has spread\\n      to all parts of India and its votaries are doing yeomans service for the\\n      good of the suffering humanity.\\n      \\n We are meeting this evening on a\\n      historic occasion and we have to arrive at decisions which might make or\\n      mar the future history of Homoeopathy in India. It may be that forces of\\n      disruption, destruction and obstruction are at work; it may be that self\\n      and vested interests seem to thwart the smooth progress of Homoeopathy; it\\n      may be that some may seem to play in the hands of the Powers that are not\\n      too sympathetic to the cause of Homoeopathy; it may be that the present\\n      seems to be chaotic and future of Homoeopathy dubious but great is truth\\n      indeed and will prevail. We should not lose heart or throw up the sponge.\\n      Tradition, authority, sectarianism, dogmatism are great obstacles on the\\n      way. But obstacles and difficulties are meant to be fought out and\\n      overcome. Strifes and dissensions, discords and disunities may hamper our\\n      progress but they are nonetheless signs of lifes activities. It is a good\\n      augury that the Homoeopathic profession is shaking off its age - long\\n      slumber and getting more and more conscious of its duties and obligation,\\n      its rights and privileges and of its short - comings and practical\\n      difficulties. The life of Hahnemann is there to encourage us; the\\n      masterful will of his dynamic spirit is there to inspire us to intensify\\n      our activities; his achievements are there to goad us to realise greater\\n      success; and his personality is always before us to take lessons from, in\\n      our life which as Swami Vivekananda puts it, is \"a process of\\n      unfolding and development of a being under circumstances tending to press\\n      it down.\"\\n      \\n That Homoeopathy is a scientific system\\n      of treatment, philosophically sound, logically unimpeachable, practically\\n      highly efficacious in curing the sick and cheap enough to suit the poor\\n      economic condition of the Indian masses - has become a much talked - of\\n      subject in the country. But why is it not spreading sufficiently and\\n      adequately in our motherland or in fact anywhere in the world? Why is our\\n      National Government not still keen on according official recognition to\\n      this superb system of healing art or providing ways and means for its\\n      development and diffusion? Why the public opinion is not gaining strength\\n      enough to put sufficient pressure on our Government to take interest in\\n      it? Why sufficient number of fully equipped Homoeopathic teaching\\n      institutions and hospitals are not growing to turn out adequate number of\\n      fully qualified Homoeopathic physicians in the country?\\n      \\n It is high time that we should draw the\\n      attention of the profession and the laity to provide answers to so many\\n      \"whys\" and to solve the pressing problems in the matter\\n      concerned. On a cursory view it becomes evident that the Homoeopathic\\n      profession, the people and the Government are each individually and\\n      collectively responsible for this impasse.\\n      \\n The so - called Allopathy still\\n      occupies the dominant place in any country, even in the land of birth of\\n      Homoeopathy. It is no wonder that Homoeopathy, being a discovery of merely\\n      a century and a half still lags behind its rival shool. But it is a wonder\\n      of wonders that Homoeopathy has already encompassed the whole world within\\n      such a short period since it was ushered into existence by Hahnemann.\\n      History of man reveals that nowhere a new truth was accepted by him easily\\n      and readily, obsessed as he is with conservatism, tradition, authority and\\n      vested interests. Nonetheless the triumphant march of Homoeopathy with a\\n      such a meteoric speed throughout the length and breadth of the world is a\\n      proof positive of the truth inherent in the system and phenomenal\\n      therapeutic efficacy of this healing art. It is one more glaring instance\\n      of mans love of truth against heavy odds that impede his progress at every\\n      step.\\n      \\n For the propagation of any new truth\\n      and its acceptance by man, in general, the first and foremost condition is\\n      the turning out of sufficient number of persons who have realised the\\n      truth and are adept in the practice of it. This involves establishment of\\n      a sufficient number of teaching institutions which will turn out experts\\n      in the science and art of Homoeopathy; and a sufficient number of\\n      Homoeopathic Hospital where, the efficacy of this system of treatment will\\n      be put to test.\\n      \\n Human knowledge is becoming\\n      unmanageably vast. The appearance of specialists has become indispensable.\\n      So special Hospitals for the treatment of specific types of diseases have\\n      sprung forth elsewhere, e.g. Tuberculosis Hospitals, Cancer Hospitals,\\n      Hospital for Tropical Diseases etc. Because of organisation of these\\n      hospitals people generally think of getting themselves treated in these\\n      institutions. As there are no fully - equipped general Homoeopathic\\n      Hospitals and not to speak of special Homoeopathic Hospitals and not to\\n      speak of special Homoeopathic Hospitals the result is Homoeopathy is not\\n      getting a fair chance of treating those diseases like tuberculosis,\\n      cancer, acute infectious diseases of epidemic type e.g., Small-pox,\\n      Cholera etc. on a large and organised scale. Consequently the general\\n      public cannot keep much faith in this treatment and mostly take recourse\\n      to homoeopathic treatment when the case is \"past all hope and past\\n      all surgery\". Hence the establishment of fully - equipped\\n      Homoeopathic institutions (College - cum - Hospitals) is an imperative\\n      necessity for enhancing the prestige of the Homoeopathic profession and\\n      for convincing the people about the therapeutic efficacy of this system of\\n      treatment. Is it not a pity that Homoeopathy once established its\\n      reputation by treating Cholera cases in this city and now nobody thinks of\\n      this treatment in Cholera cases and rushes the patient to the Allopathic\\n      Hospitals which are especially meant for these types of patients? How can\\n      we hope to gain ground under these circumstances?\\n      \\n The next great obstacle is the apathy\\n      and in many cases active antagonism of our Government, both at the Centre\\n      and at least in some of the State, towards Homoeopathy. The Government is\\n      under the thumb of its medical directorates which are solely manned by\\n      Allopathic doctors. The main reasons for the non - acceptance of the\\n      Homoeopathic system of treatment may be summed up in three words:\\n      tradition, authority and professionalism. Their psychology is easily\\n      understood if it is borne in mind that the conservative inertia of human\\n      mind attempts to reject any new thought will all the means at its\\n      disposal. Another reason is due to vested interests. Even a cursory glance\\n      at the history of origin and spread of Homoeopathy, enables one to find\\n      out that the opposition to this system from the start, was not scientific\\n      but rather of commercial nature on the part of the apothecaries who were\\n      afraid of losing their trade - profits. We regret to note that the Central\\n      Government have not yet implemented a single recommendation put forward by\\n      the Homoeopathic Enquiry Committee, Planning Commission. Third Health\\n      Ministers Conference, Ad Hoc Committee etc. though Homoeopathic Acts have\\n      been passed in the States of Bombay, U.P., Madhya Pradesh, Travancore -\\n      Cochin, Bihar etc. I is curious to note that W. Bengal is the only State\\n      where a Homoeopathic Bill has recently been thrown out by the State\\n      Government.\\n      \\n Another great obstacle is the\\n      psychology of the general mass of population who fail to adopt a proper\\n      philosophical attitude towards Homoeopathy and takes the Homoeopathic\\n      Therapeutic Law as great paradox contrary to common sense. Unless we can\\n      educate the public in the matter, we cannot hope to secure their whole -\\n      hearted support for this system of treatment.\\n      \\n Lack of enthusiasm for constructive\\n      works on the part of the Homoeopathic profession, the apathy of our\\n      Government and hesitancy on the part of the public to accept Homoeopathy\\n      are great obstacles to the spread of this system of treatment in the\\n      country. Unless this vicious circles is broken the progress of Homoeopathy\\n      is bound to be impeded. We have to fight on all fronts if we aspire to\\n      achieve victory in our battle for the cause of Homoeopathy and the\\n      suffering humanity.\\n      \\n But our first necessity as pointed out\\n      by the Soul of India expressing itself through Sri Aurobindo, is: If India\\n      is to survive and do her appointed work in the world, the youth of India\\n      should learn to think, to think on all subjects, to think independently,\\n      fruitfully, going to the heart of things, not stopped by their surface,\\n      free of pre - judgements, shearing sophism and prejudice asunder as with a\\n      sharp sword smiting down obscurantism of all kinds as with a mace of\\n      Bhima.\\n      \\n \"Let our brains no longer, like\\n      European infants, be swathed with swaddling clothes; let it have recover\\n      the free and unbound motion of the Gods, let it have not only the\\n      minuteness but the wide mastery and sovereignty natural to the intellect\\n      of Bharata and easily recoverable by it if it once accustomes itself to\\n      feel its own power and be convinced of its own worth.\\n      \\n \"The old fixed foundations have\\n      been broken up, we are tossing in the waters of a great upheaval and\\n      change. It is no use clinging to the old ice - floes of the past, they\\n      will soon melt and leave their refugees struggling in perilous waters. It\\n      is no use landing ourselves in the infirm bog, neither sea nor good, dry\\n      land of a second - hand Europeanism. We shall only die there a miserable\\n      and unclean death.\\n      \\n \"No we must learn to swim and use\\n      that power to reach the good vessel of unchanging truth; we must land\\n      again on the eternal rock of ages.\"\\n      \\n Yes, we must expand, we must assimilate\\n      whatever is assimilable for our growth. Stagnation and contraction are the\\n      signs of Death. Our knowledge must be aggressive, must diffuse through the\\n      rank and file of the whole Homoeopathic profession if we wish to survive\\n      and perpetuate ourselves; to leave an extensive ignorance either below or\\n      around us is to expose ourselves to the perpetual danger of being\\n      exterminated as a professional entity.\\n      \\n In fine, I welcome you, once again, on\\n      this historic occasion to this historic city to deliberate, to exchange\\n      view points and to come to agreed decisions with regard to our future line\\n      of action in respect of Homoeopathy in all its aspects.'\n",
      " 'Tresorie - SOME OBSERVATIONS ON NEURASTHENIA AND ITS TREATMENT\\n[Neurasthenia & Treatment]\\n\\n WHEN, thirty-five years ago, the writer\\n      first made the acquaintance of what is now called neurasthenia, it was\\n      known as spinal irritation, and the best of modern researches have been\\n      unable to give a better definition beyond a functional disturbance of the\\n      spinal and cerebral nerves, dependent on a morbid process, for which\\n      \"irritation\" is as proper a term as any. As deaths do not occur,\\n      autopsies throw no light on the subject. Briefly stated, neurasthenia,\\n      when observed from the beginning through its chronic course, has a period\\n      of prodromal symptoms followed by a protracted acute, and succeeded by a\\n      still more protracted chronic, state, between the end of which and the\\n      beginning of convalescence there is a very vague, often indiscernible,\\n      boundary line.\\n      \\n The prodromal symptoms are quite\\n      indefinite and very variable, pointing to nothing in particular. Loss of\\n      appetite, irregular sleep, excitability alternating with lassitude, etc.,\\n      are often overlooked, especially when the second stage-display of unusual\\n      mental and physical energy without subsequent fatigue- becomes apparent.\\n      This is often mistaken for a sign of unusually good health. When a young\\n      girl or mature woman, married or unmarried, feels that she can study ten\\n      hours a day and devote half of her night to pleasure or business; when\\n      besides much mental occupation she begins to rejoice in long walks without\\n      fatigue, that is the time when the mischief is going on without exciting\\n      timely suspicion. Relief is at last sought when the functional disorder of\\n      the nerves has gone to the opposite extreme, and becomes manifest in what\\n      is properly and popularly termed \"nervous prostration,\" when\\n      instead of having no sense of fatigue, the best bodily or mental effort\\n      seems intolerable, in grave cases rendering the patient a helpless being,\\n      completely dependent on the unremitting assistance of others whom she )it\\n      is usually a woman) rules with the inexorable power of the vis inertiae.\\n      \\n During this usually very protracted\\n      period of the disease convalescence usually sets in, but so imperceptibly\\n      that the physician alone can sometimes estimate its progress, which is\\n      unnoticeable to others towards whom the patient acts as she has for months\\n      or years. This is the time for action, too often delayed from motives of\\n      misplaced sympathy on the part of relatives and friends.\\n      \\n The affections is in many instances\\n      limited to the spine, the mind becoming only secondarily tired. In other\\n      cases it is spinal and cerebral; in others again chiefly cerebral. The\\n      line between this and insanity is always clearly definable. Though a\\n      neurasthenic patient may become insane, and probably the reverse, yet both\\n      are distinct conditions.\\n      \\n Books speak of this disease at common\\n      to men and women. Yet in this region in small towns as well as in large\\n      cities the cases of neurasthenia in women are preponderatingly great.\\n      \\n Hypochondriacs and hysteria stand in\\n      peculiar relation to neurasthenia. They maybe regarded as different\\n      species of the same genus; that is, more or less deeply seated\\n      disturbances of the cerebro-spinal system in which the sympathetic system\\n      is probably indirectly involved, as many functional disturbances presided\\n      over by the great sympathetic system often testify. Hypochondriasis, pure\\n      and simple as occurring in men, is easily distinguishable by its striking\\n      characteristic of introspection and despondency, occasioned by abnormal\\n      sensations, without marked physical weakness and tiredness. Pure\\n      hypochondriacs are often energetic, conscientious workers. In hysteria\\n      there is neither great tiredness nor tendency to introspection, but a\\n      paroxysmal or prolonged absence of the power of self control, in grave\\n      cases associated with tonic or clonic muscular spasm and loss of\\n      consciousness. While neurasthenia in its uncomplicated forms is free from\\n      these symptoms, but, as ample experience teaches, often complicated with\\n      both of the preceding forms to such an extent that it is often very\\n      difficult to tell which is primary and which secondary. The symptoms known\\n      as introspection, hysterical aberrations of the emotions, and neurasthenic\\n      sense of exhaustion are in their distinctive manifestations most important\\n      and constitute indications in the selection of remedial and dietetic\\n      measures.\\n      \\n The following are some observation of\\n      peculiarities observed in a large number of cases and peculiar to all:.\\n      \\n Introspection.-The neurasthenic patient\\n      in variably expresses her desire for relief, not so much in a direct\\n      appeal as in a supplicating, subdued tone of voice and manner. She rarely\\n      asks, \"What can you do to relieve me?\" but almost invariably,\\n      \"What is the cause of\" this or that sensation? If she is\\n      introspective, that is, hypochondriacal, she becomes a nosomaniac,\\n      watching acutely every one of her numerous distressing sensation, on the\\n      unremitting analysis of which her mind dwells. In marked cases she is\\n      quite unable to think of anything outside of herself, and in many cases\\n      dislikes to do so, preferring to river her attention on herself. Attempts\\n      to divert her annoy or anger her. Friends and relatives implore the\\n      physician to divert the patient, but all their attempts are in vain\\n      because quite misdirected.\\n      \\n Positive and Negative Will.-It seems\\n      sometimes as if the patient delights in her self-inspection, and that she\\n      prefers her condition to speedy recovery. This is not the case, for the\\n      patient will always assure the physician of her wish to get well. During\\n      the acute stage-a long yet definable period-this wish and longing cannot\\n      well be utilized, but the long and ill-defined period of convalescence\\n      must first be awaited. Here we shall always discover that the wish and the\\n      will of the patient are two very different mental conditions. The desire\\n      or wish for recovery is entirely unattended by any will effort to\\n      accomplish the desired end. The injunctions and directions of the\\n      physician are resisted by the same unconquerable power of negative power,\\n      or vis inertiae. The patient having been unable to exert her will, now\\n      thinks herself unable to use it.\\n      \\n Numerous Symptoms of Patients.-To\\n      physicians in search of indications for medicines each statement of\\n      patient concerning a sensation is apt to be considered as a symptom. Many\\n      years ago, when resolved to get at the keynote of a patient\\'s case, the\\n      writer determined to allow the patient to detail all her symptoms as long\\n      as she chose and to take accurate notes of each one till the right one\\n      should be disclosed; and this was to be done regardless of time and\\n      exertion. The patient, one who needed no urging to describe her\\n      \"symptoms,\" began in an almost inaudible voice, detailing one\\n      sensation after another with an unrivalled degree of clearness and\\n      vividness of expression; as she proceeded the voice became stronger, her\\n      face slightly flushed, and the most perfect descriptive language flowed in\\n      an endless stream. Each word was written down, page after page was filled;\\n      still she went on with unmistakable signs of satisfaction at being able to\\n      pour her pent-up emotions into willing and sympathetic ears. If, for a\\n      moment, the flow of language was interrupted, a simple question would\\n      re-animate her to proceed with renewed energy. Feelings seemed to beget\\n      feelings; their complexity gave the patient no trouble; her intellect was\\n      equal to the action of unraveling the most complicated sensation,\\n      separating them into their component parts and spreading them out before\\n      the mind of the listener. A glance at the watch showed that nearly two\\n      hours had passed, during which the feeblest of neurasthenic patients had\\n      talked incessantly. The note-book was full, the keynote was found. It was\\n      this: neurasthenic patients have innumerable sensation and exhibit no\\n      sings of fatigue after talking incessantly for nearly two hours.\\n      \\n Great Endurance of Neurasthenics.-The\\n      instance just related, which is one of many, illustrates two things. One\\n      is, that it is not the kind of sensation described but the fact that\\n      neurasthenics have innumerable sensations, that constitute the symptoms.\\n      The other thing is that many neurasthenics are capable of great exertion\\n      without suffering disagreeable after- effects from fatigue. This is\\n      illustrated by other cases of which I have notes. A highly neurasthenic\\n      young lady consented to camp out for her health near a lake. She was\\n      induced to join a party for a short walk along the lake. By trying what\\n      they thought a shorter road the party lost their way and took a very long\\n      walk of about four hours, through bogs and over forces. The neurasthenic\\n      was less fatigued than some of the others. The interesting observation was\\n      subsequently made that the patient had become interested in a young man of\\n      the party. She recovered her health within a year from that time. Other\\n      cases of this kind will appear under the head of therapeutic suggestions.\\n      \\n Neurasthenic Patients Crave\\n      Sympathy.-This is one of the most formidable obstacles to the curative\\n      management of such cases, for the kind of sympathy such patients crave is\\n      expressions of condolence and more or less deep affliction at so much\\n      suffering as the patient expresses. Such sympathy is most natural and does\\n      honor to the feelings of parents, sisters, brothers and husbands, but it\\n      is unfortunate that the deeper their expression of affliction so much the\\n      more profound will be the mental dejection and weakness of the patient.\\n      Almost every case which has come under the writer\\'s observation has been\\n      much hampered if not made hopeless by this condition of things, against\\n      which no remedy suggests itself that would not be construed as\\n      \"unkind\".\\n      \\n The origin of this very formidable and\\n      refractory nervous disease, like that of most diseases usually termed\\n      chronic, is either hereditary or acquired, as the histories of every\\n      observed case plainly testify. Either the father was a hypochondriac or\\n      the mother neurasthenic, or both parents were of unsound nervous\\n      constitution. Dipsomania on the part of parents produces neurasthenia in\\n      the children, as readily as it will be followed by any other form of\\n      nervous disease, according to the individual predisposition of the\\n      offspring. The excessive use of tea and coffee is another very active\\n      factor in the history of neurasthenics. Where fathers inclined to alcohol,\\n      mothers are addicted to tea and coffee, which, while its immediate effects\\n      do not obtrude themselves upon our notice, are none the less insidious in\\n      their more remote consequences.\\n      \\n The acquired forms of neurasthenia are\\n      of utmost interest to the therapeutist, and the sources of acquisition are\\n      readily stated. They are much brain-work with insufficient food and sleep.\\n      Such conditions obtain chiefly in women (less frequently in men) of fine\\n      intellectual ability, conscientiousness and ambition. Physical overwork\\n      with unintellectual women has no such effect. Quite analogous to the above\\n      are the conditions of care and sorrow, especially in women who are able\\n      for a long time to conceal and control their emotions. The usual\\n      consequence of such states of mind is disregard of food and insufficient\\n      sleep. Instances of acquired neurasthenia are presented in families of\\n      several girls and boys, where one or more of the former are Neurasthenic\\n      while the latter are vigorous and athletic. Boys delighting in vigorous\\n      exercise do not, as is the case with girls, lose appetite and sleep.\\n      \\n The effects of nervous exhaustion in\\n      boys are usually much less grave than in girls; as a rule such effects are\\n      manifested in mental, not muscular, tiredness, and they are relieved by\\n      air and exercise, while in girls and women those influences are shunned\\n      because they seem to increase the tiredness.\\n      \\n Predisposition-The temperament, or what\\n      in modern pharaseology is called the personal equation, plays a visible\\n      but uncontrollable part in the progress of neurasthenia, as temperament\\n      greatly determines the other imperfectly known condition known as\\n      predisposition. Where the disease is hereditary, it is easy to say that\\n      the predisposition is due to that source; where there is no history of\\n      heredity and where neurasthenia exists in the last members of a\\n      generation, it may be attributed to acquired predisposition which needed\\n      only the exciting cause to establish the disease in its most typical form.\\n      \\n One of the most common forms of\\n      neurasthenia, often quite intractable, results from a serious defect in\\n      our public school system, one which affects chiefly girls from twelve to\\n      fourteen years of age. The following is a brief example: The child rises\\n      late with no appetite for breakfast and no time to eat it if so inclined.\\n      The lessons, however, have been learned the evening before, and the school\\n      work is begun with an ambitions will and a crammed mind, and continues\\n      with one intermission of often not more than ten minutes or three of four\\n      hours. The pupil arrives at home ravenously hungry, eats too fast, and too\\n      much of injudiciously prepared food, too long in digesting to leave room\\n      for an appetite for even a light evening meal, or even for a breakfast the\\n      next morning.\\n      \\n In another case the girl or boy grows\\n      desperately hungry while at school, but being unprovided with food\\n      (lunch), goes on with the school exercises, at the end of which the sense\\n      of hunger has vanished and has been replaced by an aversion to normal\\n      food, with a possible craving for something pungent and indigestible. This\\n      observation can easily be made in many instances, and will, in as many\\n      cases, be seen to lead to nervous prostration, which is then treated by\\n      vile, patented concoctions consisting largely of whiskey, under the name\\n      of \"tonics,\" while the patient needs only the best that a\\n      legitimate market affords prepared in a sensible manner.\\n      \\n Typical Cases Ending in Rapid\\n      Recovery.-Curative results have already been indicated in what has been\\n      said above, and further indications for treatment may be gathered from a\\n      few cases of extremely rapid recovery of apparently incurable cases, to\\n      which brief allusion will here be made. A woman of forty had been a victim\\n      of grave neurasthenia for five years. In the absence of an inclination to\\n      exert himself, she had, during that period, been mostly confined to her\\n      bed or lounge, in the meantime giving birth to two children, going through\\n      gestation and confinement normally, without recovering from neurasthenic\\n      prostration which, in the course of some years more, rendered her entirely\\n      helpless. Her condition was associated with a feeling of dropping to\\n      pieces unless supported and braced by a harness of wood, iron and leather,\\n      in which she \"sat up\" for several hours each day, spending the\\n      rest of the time in bed. Having left the patient in this condition, it was\\n      reported before the writer\\'s next professional visit that Mrs.-had been\\n      cured, and that she was able to go out like other people. A visit to the\\n      house confirmed the report. The patient came to the door herself, and in a\\n      quiet manner, entirely without the least expression of joy or wonder at\\n      her release, stated, that having heard of a famous \"magnetic\\n      physician,\" she summoned him, was ordered by him to arise and stand;\\n      protesting that it was impossible, she was raised to her feet and again\\n      ordered to stand, then to walk. Fearing that she would fall, she begged\\n      the magnetic doctor to support her, which he peremptorily refused, saying\\n      she might fall if she liked. Instead of falling, she had to walk about the\\n      room, was then placed upon a lounge and subjected to a severe treatment of\\n      rolling and pummelling, and then ordered to dress and sit up until tired,\\n      to remain up and about like other people, and to call on the doctor in\\n      future, as he would not come so far to the patient again. This happened\\n      about twenty-five years ago, and the patient has been in very fair health\\n      arrested by insisting that all professional visits by the writer or any\\n      other physician to whose sympathy the patient could appeal must cease.\\n      This injunction was carried out conscientiously with the best results by\\n      the husband of the patient. Perhaps we may learn from this that sometimes,\\n      at least, the familiar motto is reversed, and angels rush in where fools\\n      fear to tread.\\n      \\n Profiting by this experience, another\\n      neurasthenic woman, unmarried, but of most intractable, antagonistic\\n      temperament, confined to her bed, in and out of hospitals, for years,\\n      wearing out the strength and means of her relatives and the patience of\\n      many physicians, was at length abandoned by them. It was a case of spinal\\n      and cerebral neurasthenia complicated with hypochondriasis in its most\\n      trying form of introspective maunderings and endless description of\\n      symptoms. She tormented her advisers by her endless tirades, the\\n      indulgence of which invariably aggravated her condition, and were there\\n      fore avoided, until once her physician yielded to the patient\\'s\\n      importunities for a visit, when be found her in her usual abject state of\\n      prostration. Guided by experience derived from cases like the one first\\n      described, he assisted the patient to her feet and marched her, will you\\n      nil you, up and down the room until he, at least, was thoroughly tired,\\n      and then departed with the promise never to do so again. The patient, on\\n      her part, made a number of her unnameable promises, but kept on her feet\\n      and let the doctors alone. Though not cured of deeply-rooted morbid mental\\n      faults, the neurasthenic phase of her condition had yielded to the change\\n      of the antagonistic element of her character from passive to very\\n      practical activity. A third very serious case of this kind occurred in the\\n      person of a girl of fifteen, of selfish character, who gradually became\\n      bed-ridden with spinal and cerebral neurasthenia, and tormented with the\\n      usual multifarious painful sensations, none of which, on the most\\n      pains-taking physical examination, resulted from demonstrable organic\\n      disease of genital or abdominal organs. The patient was most tenderly\\n      cared for by her mother, who, in the course of years, became so imbued\\n      with the idea of yielding to every wish and whim of the patient, that at\\n      length remonstrance became useless. The mother, though recognizing the\\n      importance of persuading or urging her daughter to depend more on herself,\\n      admitted that she had yielded so long that now she must continue to feed,\\n      dress and assist her charge in the most trivial things. Her food had to be\\n      placed in her mouth, the position of a hand or foot changed by some one\\n      else, although patient did so spontaneously when she chose. This went on\\n      for fifteen years, when the mother, growing old and feeble, died. Her\\n      maternal support being gone, the patient at once proved her ability to\\n      walk, to dress, to feed herself, and to seek light employment. Though far\\n      from well, she is equally far fro being a helpless, bed-ridden invalid.\\n      \\n A fourth case, still very vividly\\n      impressed on the writer\\'s mind, was one of a healthy, romping girl of 14,\\n      who, as happen in this remarkably capricious disease, in the midst of\\n      perfect health, one day took to her bed and remained there with all the\\n      symptoms of neurasthenia, involving first the spinal and finally the\\n      cerebral nerves. This patient was very amiable, conscientious, and\\n      sensible, never loquacious, and not troubled with hypochondriacal thoughts\\n      or sensations. Tiredness was the only expression she used in describing\\n      her feelings. There was literally no variation from this condition, which\\n      confined her to her bed for years, till she grew from a girl to a woman.\\n      Eating and sleeping well, and improving perceptibly in personal appearance\\n      and character, yet she lay on her couch tired and watched over with\\n      unremitting care by a most anxious mother, showing her solicitude and\\n      sympathy in every feature. Once, in the second year of the disease, a\\n      favorable interruption occurred. The mother, still a young woman, gave\\n      birth to another child. During her confinement the neurasthenic patient\\n      was in charge of her mother\\'s nurse, assisted by other servants. The\\n      nurse, while devoted to the daughter, agreed with the writer that excess\\n      of sympathy was injurious, and used her best and judicious endeavors\\n      gradually to persuade the patient to make some physical effort at walking\\n      and standing. In this she was so successful that in two weeks she\\n      accompanied the girl on half-mile walks up and down hill, finally without\\n      assistance. Thus, recovery seemed assured, and everything was favorable\\n      progressing towards it when the mother, having fully recovered, again took\\n      charge of her daughter, with the result that she at once took to her\\n      lounge and remained there two years longer. About that time other advice\\n      was urged and gladly acceded to, with the result that the case was\\n      diagnosed by an eminent surgeon as spinal paralysis in consequence of\\n      concussion, though it could never be shown when and where it occurred.\\n      Salves, plasters, anodynes, nervines, and electricity did no good, but\\n      effectually destroyed appetite and digestion, which higher to had been\\n      normal. So this adviser resigned in favor of a third, who, being a younger\\n      and less prejudiced man, agreed perfectly with the writer\\'s original\\n      opinion. He advised return to moderate exercise, avoidance of drugs, and\\n      less display of sympathy. This, though formerly rejected as\\n      \"unkind,\" was now acceded to as coming from a nerve- specialist,\\n      fresh from Europe, at that time very rare. Still attending the other\\n      members of the family, the writer had sample opportunity of observing the\\n      course of the case. Improvement was very slow and uncertain till financial\\n      misfortune overtook the family. Almost with a bound our patient left her\\n      cough, and, organizing a kindergarten, strove energetically in supporting\\n      herself and assisting her mother. The change came about in less than three\\n      weeks, and resulted in perfect recovery.\\n      \\n At this point another very instructive\\n      case of very speedy recovery, after six or seven years of neurasthenic\\n      prostration, deserves to be mentioned. A woman of 35 had been in bed and\\n      on the lounge most of the time for nearly seven years, at the end of which\\n      time she became my patient, her regular medical attendant having gone to\\n      Europe. She was of very amiable disposition and as sensitive as she was\\n      weak. Her symptoms, as in the other cases, were instantaneous exhaustion\\n      on the least physical exertion. She could give herself up to no mental\\n      occupation beyond directing her house-hold affairs, the education of her\\n      son, and the rehearsal of her numerous sensations. She had not been my\\n      patient long when her husband failed in business, so that the family was\\n      reduced from very comfortable circumstances to a condition which made it\\n      necessary for the patient to make her own living and that of the family.\\n      This she almost at once proceeded to do, setting aside all other\\n      considerations and establishing a boarding-house, where she did most of\\n      the work herself. This she has done now for ten or twelve years without a\\n      serious relapse. The time involved in the period of convalescence was\\n      scarcely more than three weeks, a although her work maybe said to have\\n      begun at the moment her resolution was taken.\\n      \\n Prognostics.-From these and other cases\\n      in and outside of the writer\\'s practice, it is safe to say that the\\n      majority of cases of neurasthenia recover, though years may elapse before\\n      that period. We learn, furthermore, that recoveries, especially of very\\n      inveterate cases, depend on conditions beyond the control of the\\n      physician, as was the case in the above-recorded instances, where\\n      circumstances forced the patient to cases to wish for recovery and to make\\n      an effort of the will. This having been once accomplished self-confidence,\\n      for a long time in abeyance, was permanently restored.\\n      \\n Curability, further, depends very much\\n      on the temperament of the patient, whether amiable, tractable and\\n      confiding in the honest endeavors of the physician, or whether refractory,\\n      suspicious, untruthful, selfish and antagonistic, of a disposition\\n      impossible to win over on account of unnatural distrust of every\\n      well-meaning person. The degree of intelligence of patients also has a\\n      pronounced influence on the result. The most readily curable cases are\\n      those acquired without hereditary predisposition, where the cause is found\\n      in the absence of food and sleep, also where sorrow and anxiety can be\\n      averted or counteracted by judicious conduct of near relatives and\\n      friends.\\n      \\n Dietetic Treatment.-This, as medicinal\\n      treatment, must be governed by the stage at which the case comes into the\\n      physician\\'s hands-whether yet in its prodromal, its acute or its chronic\\n      phase. The prodromal stage of the disease has no very decided\\n      pathognomonic signs. The most that can be recognized in this stage is that\\n      the patient\\'s habits or duties are of a kind which will eventually lead to\\n      obdurate neurasthenia if not arrested in time by removing the exciting\\n      causes. Too much pleasure, as well as too much care, especially in girls\\n      and woman, tends to neglect of food and rest, in the absence of which,\\n      excitements, whether of pleasure or care, begets a state of unrest in\\n      which repose is disagreeable. With such a condition comes a list of\\n      incipient casual complaints of headache, imperfect sleep, notional ways of\\n      eating, working or playing. A few questions will determine whether the\\n      patient is living according to normal or abnormal habits with regard to\\n      appetite, sleep and occupation. Where these are found, their alteration to\\n      normal ways must be instead on. It is unnecessary to say that this is\\n      easier said than done, for it will probably meet with serious objections\\n      on the part of the patient, if not on that of her relatives; for most\\n      likely she has examinations for college to prepare for, involving several\\n      months of dose and careful study at night, and the patient cannot waste\\n      time in sleeping and eating while cramming that little excited and\\n      ambitions brain. A failure in the examinations would be as much of a\\n      disappointment to parents as to patient, who proves, as usual, that this\\n      appellation is a misnomer. She accordingly goes in as she please, lied by\\n      an increasing morbidly ambitions impulse, and the result is likely to be\\n      the mournful satisfaction on the part of the physician of being obliged to\\n      say, \"I told you before what would happen.\" Of course, all\\n      regret the now evident nerve-prostration, while, if the doctor had\\n      succeeded in enforcing his rules, he would in many cases experience the\\n      still more painful reproach of having been too severe. Nevertheless,\\n      absolute firmness and a kindly but unflinching exertion of his will,\\n      without the least compromise, reward the physician with the best results\\n      in such cases.\\n      \\n When the case, after the stage of\\n      excitement and untiring restlessness (at which it would still be speedily\\n      curable by simple dietetic rules) has, after weeks or months, entered upon\\n      the phase of painful prostration, here we encounter backache, oppressive\\n      headache, and absolute loss of mental or bodily endurance, measures of\\n      dietetic management are much less effective and much more difficult to\\n      find. it is at this stage that slight rise of temperature will occur,\\n      especially towards evening; then the backache and headache disappear, the\\n      pallor is replaced by a flush of color, the eyes lose their listless look,\\n      and the patient is inclined to enter upon some diversion or excitement,\\n      followed by a restless night and a morning of exhaustion and a renewal of\\n      all painful sensations. Most of such patients feel much better in the\\n      evening when they are ready for some entertainment, while in a normal\\n      state this would be the time for relaxation and repose.\\n      \\n The dietetic treatment of this stage is\\n      methodical rest. In severe cases the patient will do well to remain in bed\\n      for several days or even for weeks. It is well to shorten this period as\\n      much as possible and to insist on walking about, or, at least. sitting for\\n      a specified time every day. This may be varied b equally specified periods\\n      of rest in the recumbent position.\\n      \\n Irregularities of eating are at this\\n      and at all times to be superseded by the most rigid regularity of meals.\\n      The traditional and conventional three-meal system, however well adapted\\n      to the needs of a vigorous man or woman, does not agree with the\\n      neurasthenic patient. It is much better that these should eat oftener;\\n      four times a day is best in most cases, for the simple reason that in this\\n      way a patient, while eating less at a time, consumes more food in the\\n      aggregate.\\n      \\n As neurasthenic patients are rarely\\n      troubled with absolute aversion to wholesome food, they are generally able\\n      to consume a liberal quantity, about which it is only needful to remark\\n      here that the food should be selected from among the articles and dishes\\n      which the patient likes, provided they belong to the order of good, normal\\n      articles of food, to the exclusion of those which simply please the taste\\n      without being digestible. A dish entirely of meat or \"animal\\n      food\" is as far from being a good diet for neurasthenics as one\\n      consisting entirely of \"vegetable\" food. As a rule, the diet\\n      list should comprise one-third of nitrogenous material and two-thirds of\\n      carbohydrates. Together with these, it is a great mistake to neglect the\\n      fats, such as good butter and the fats of meats. And, lastly, every\\n      patient of this kind should be made to drink some water often, a dietetic\\n      feature too often neglected.\\n      \\n During this stage, actually fatiguing\\n      exercise of body and mind should be avoided, while, on the other hand, the\\n      patient\\'s mind should be directed away from herself, in which she is much\\n      assisted by withholding a certain kind of emotional sympathy, quite as\\n      natural as it is difficult to repress on the part of affectionate persons.\\n      Of this, a few words further on.\\n      \\n There is no definite time for the\\n      duration of this stage, which, however, depends largely on the time during\\n      which the exciting causes have acted, either aided by or without a\\n      predisposition. It is certain, however, that the sooner it is recognized\\n      and the exciting causes eliminated, so much the sooner recovery will\\n      begin. But there is a stage at which the best of experience and judgment\\n      often fail, especially in very inveterate cases. If the case is one of a\\n      patient whom the physician has had opportunity of watching at least since\\n      the earlier stages, the difficulty is not so great as it is in old cases\\n      months or even of several years\\' duration which come to treatment late. In\\n      these, the line between the intermediate stage and incipient convalescence\\n      cannot be drawn. The patient is as neurasthenic and hypochondriacal as\\n      ever; cannot bear the slightest mental or bodily exertion, not even a word\\n      or a look, without sings of apparent exhaustion, while nearly the whole\\n      time is spent in bed under anxious care of sympathetic attendants. In such\\n      cases, having become assured, by careful physical examination, of the\\n      absence of organic disease, seeing the patient generally well nourished\\n      and in fair muscular condition, the physician is warranted in assuming\\n      that the disease has run its course, that whatever morbid (pathological)\\n      process there may have been progressing in the nervous system, this\\n      process has now come to and end, but it has left the patient\\'s mental\\n      condition habituated to the moods of the past months or years, and fixed,\\n      as it were, indelibly in the memory. It is the habit that now remains, not\\n      the disease.\\n      \\n If reasonably sure of this, and calling\\n      to mind the rapid recoveries and the circumstances attending them, as\\n      above detailed, the physician is now safe in ordering a more energetic\\n      treatment, calculated to rouse the self-reliance of the patient. All\\n      visible signs of sympathy must now be set aside; the actins and demeanor\\n      of the attendants should, from this time, if not before, be changed so as\\n      to give the patient the impression that she is no longer an invalid, but\\n      expected to rely on her own exertion. Instead of being fed, the food\\n      should be placed where she must go for and eat it. She should now be\\n      expected to dress and attend, without assistance, to her natural wants.\\n      This, with some temperaments, is almost impossible, with al extremely\\n      difficult. The best course to pursue is to remove such patients from\\n      sympathetic relatives or friends, and to place them in charge of kind,\\n      reliable, but eminently practical nurses.\\n      \\n The first effect of this is either to\\n      throw the patient into a stage of helpless despondency, which, again\\n      appealing powerfully to the sympathies of those nearest to her, often\\n      frustrates the physician\\'s plans which, if firmly but kindly adhered to,\\n      would, ere long, prove of their superiority by signs of returning\\n      self-reliance and absence of complaints on the part of the patient. A\\n      second form of effect is that occurring in patients of obstreperous,\\n      selfish disposition, whose opposition and even anger is aroused by being\\n      thrown on their own resources after the removal of depressing and\\n      unpractical sympathy. This opposition or temper, often manifested in all\\n      sorts of intrigues and subterfuges on the part of the patient, if not\\n      supinely yielded to by sympathetic persons, will finally be replaced by a\\n      more rational disposition. On the whole, anger or active opposition are\\n      signs of returning energy, which, once coming to the consciousness of the\\n      patient, takes the form of self- reliance. it is this way that the cures\\n      of chronic cases above related can be explained, and physicians should\\n      profit by such experience for the benefit of their patients.\\n      \\n The general dietetic management now\\n      readily follows from what has been said, and needs only a few general\\n      modifications. The first duty of the physician will be to test the degree\\n      of reliance to be placed on the patient and her friends, ad to win them\\n      over if possible to his plans, and his success will be in proportion to\\n      the degree of confidence he is able to inspire. This personal confidence\\n      should not degenerate into a mere personal liking or attachment of a\\n      sympathy-craving neurasthenic who should discover henceforth that all\\n      sentimental expressing of sympathy are about to take a practical form,\\n      aiming at a definite result-the patient\\'s health-which she wishes but\\n      cannot exert her will to attain. The best and often the only way to do\\n      away with sentiment and to reach practical kindness is to remove the\\n      patient from certain home influence, and to place her in a hospital or\\n      elsewhere under the management of competent nurses who, without being\\n      selfish, know how to exert a certain amount of wholesome push as fast as\\n      the patient can bear it. Without the removal of sentimental sympathy, all\\n      efforts at counteracting the purely hypochondriacal side of neurasthenia\\n      are useless.\\n      \\n In these cases of neurasthenia as yet\\n      uncomplicated with the hypochondriacal element of introspective nosomania,\\n      there is only one unconditional rule to be followed, especially in\\n      acquired cases whose evident cause was incessant, conscientious work of\\n      mind and body, together with insufficient food and sleep. Such cases come\\n      on very insidiously, the loss of strength-that is, the actual waste of\\n      nerve-substance-being just a trifle grater than the quantity restored, the\\n      patient unconsciously using up a minute part of her capital every day.\\n      Here the rule should be to reverse matters to insuring a supply of\\n      nourishment and time for its assimilation greater than was the case\\n      heretofore. The case of young school-girls belong in this class. The time\\n      of food and rest should be carefully controlled at home, the duty of the\\n      physician being to educate indifferent and ignorant parents up to an\\n      appreciation of the nature of the case. It is generally not difficult to\\n      open their eyes through the medium of their anxiety concerning their\\n      children\\'s health. Having thus insured sufficient rest and food at home,\\n      the physician\\'s next object of attention should be the regulations of the\\n      school. Here is the point where teachers have an opportunity of exerting\\n      their most practical influence. It should be made obligatory on the part\\n      of teachers to institute inquiry as to whether pupils have had their meals\\n      before coming to school. This they could often ascertain without a\\n      question, by reading the pupil\\'s condition in her emaciated form, pale\\n      face and nervous manner. To guard against neglect at home, it would be an\\n      easy matter to insist that all pupils of public and private schools should\\n      bring with them some proper food. The few who do so generally bring\\n      sweets-an apple, orange or a few dry crackers-when a piece of good bread\\n      and slice of cold meat would be what they actually need. All pupils should\\n      pass inspection, and if remiss in this important particular, the\\n      delinquent should be dismissed with several marks against her. To expect\\n      this of teachers would be a great advance in the place of futile\\n      innovations of endeavoring to send forth from our common schools graduates\\n      in arts and sciences.\\n      \\n Sudden Effects.-A large number of cases\\n      of neurasthenia, especially those complicated with inveterate\\n      Hypochondriasis, are frequently traced to some sudden occurrence, having\\n      the effect of a mental or physical shock. In one patient, a vigorous girl,\\n      used to romping, climbing and running lie a boy, the cause was supposed to\\n      be a slight thump she received during a game of blindman\\'s-buff. She\\n      thought nothing of it at the time, but it was suggested long after the\\n      patient\\'s illness began. In another case some mental shock of joy or\\n      grief, not very severe and such as is often experienced in every person\\'s\\n      life, is the beginning of months of nervous prostration.\\n      \\n There is quite an array of evidence\\n      that neurasthenia which has entered upon a hypochondriacal stage or\\n      complication with or without a strong hysterical admixture, is curable by\\n      sudden impressions in the form of a shock, or more gradually by frequent\\n      repetitions of an impression. Such cases, as I have shown above, occur\\n      most commonly in the stage when what may be considered the essential\\n      pathological disturbances of function have run their course and have left\\n      the patient in a state of mental disturbance which indicated that the\\n      patient\\'s recovery depends entirely upon her volition. But there is none,\\n      and so far nothing has succeeded in arousing it. Persuasion is as useless\\n      and irritating, as argument would be in a case of insanity with a fixed\\n      illusion. The resemblance between this and the state of mind of a\\n      hypochondriacal neurasthenic is very close. She cannot move nor thick.\\n      Exhaustion overcomes her and keeps her its victim for years, when suddenly\\n      the scene changes, and a few days or weeks suffice to restore the patient\\n      to activity. In one instance it is attributed to medical, in another to\\n      \"mind cure,\" in a third to \"Christian science;\" in\\n      still other cases massage has done it, in others again \"magnetic\\n      influence,\" in others the very powerful factor necessity. It is\\n      certain that cases of this kind, produced by sudden effects on the mind of\\n      a predisposed person, are also cured by such effects. Whatever the visible\\n      form of these effects may be -whether that of \"Christian\\n      science,\" joy, grief or absolute inexorable necessity, there is\\n      always to be noticed a certain force and condition involving the modern\\n      idea of suggestion, which comes to the patient in an irresistible degree\\n      and now sets the function of the will in motion again.\\n      \\n Experience teaches that it is by no\\n      means a matter of indifference which of these forms of effect are brought\\n      into action. In one case it is the professional Christian scientist\\'s\\n      method, in another the almost brutal exertion of a person\\'s will combined\\n      with some physical force. In either case the patient is aroused from his\\n      inertia, and discovers his powers of mental and bodily ability to act.\\n      \\n A deplorable result is that recoveries\\n      after such effects are attributed in the popular mind to supernatural\\n      causes. That such is not the case may be gathered form instances occurring\\n      in very sensible and intelligent patients, whose reason is scarcely ever\\n      so far disturbed and weakened that they do not resent the proposition of\\n      trying, e.g., Christian science or mind cure.\\n      \\n Nevertheless, it is the mind cure which\\n      the intelligent patient needs quite as much as the ignorant and\\n      superstitious person; the difference is only the form in which the\\n      influencing force is applied. While in one case it is obedience to the\\n      candidly expressed instructions of the physician, in the other case the\\n      result is the to mystification. In either case it is the powerful stimulus\\n      of hope and aroused confidence that recovery will be realized.\\n      \\n The definition of suggestion does not\\n      fully cover the meaning, because the influence employed is greater than\\n      mere suggestion. The physician\\'s plan of action should be straightforward\\n      assurance of recovery, a direct appeal to hope, and an unceasing endeavor\\n      to arouse the self-reliance of the patient, not so much by verbal\\n      exhortations as by a manner and department from which the patient learns\\n      more readily than from words what is expected. If the attitude of the\\n      physician is appreciated, and seconded by the relatives and attendants, a\\n      favorable result is much more certain to follow.\\n      \\n Hypnotism is not advisable. There are\\n      now existing ancient neurasthenic invalids dating from the times of\\n      spiritualism when they were famous \"mediums.\" Hypnotism weakness\\n      the will and nervous endurance, and produces a predisposition to emotional\\n      nervousness with an intractable erotic admixture. The suggestions sought\\n      to be instilled into a hypnotized patient amount to nothing. The mental\\n      influence of mystical treatment administered while the patients is awake\\n      is much more powerful in awaking hope and confidence than the uncertain\\n      effects of an abnormal state like that of hypnotism. Mystification, again,\\n      though sometimes unavoidable with the best intention, is less powerful\\n      than direct and intelligible encouragement. While resort to mystification\\n      should be shunned by reputable physicians, the question arises as to what\\n      shall be done with the many who, from lack of intelligence or education,\\n      are entirely beyond the reach of honest common sense, and who will persist\\n      in mystifying themselves, who remain neurasthenic invalids in spite of the\\n      best regulations of the physician, and who do not recover unless their\\n      encouragement follows some mystical formalities which alone arouse their\\n      \"faith\" and finally their confidence and will-power. For the\\n      present there is no way out of the dilemma but to submit such patients to\\n      the suggestive methods of what is popularly known as mind cure and\\n      Christian science. In doing so, physicians should use their influence as\\n      far as possible in selecting the most honest persons of this class.\\n      \\n DISCUSSION.\\n      \\n JAMES C. WOOD, M.D.: I have nothing but\\n      words of praise for Dr. Wesselhoeft\\'s excellent paper. It is very evident\\n      that the author\\'s inspiration came not from books but from actual contact\\n      with neurasthenic subjects, for the impress of originality is most\\n      conspicuous. It is a production which could only come from one of\\n      experience and from a reasoner. I consider it a most valuable contribution\\n      to the literature of that now most interesting subject,\\n      \"neurasthenia\".\\n      \\n The doctor, in his paper, has sometimes\\n      used the term \"neurasthenia\" instead of\\n      \"neurasthenia.\" The first of these means, according to Thomas,\\n      great nervous power or excitement; the second, nervous debility. I taken\\n      it from the context that the subject dealt with is neurasthenia. To the\\n      average mind there exists what seems to me a needless confusion regarding\\n      the terms, nervous prostration, hysteria and hystero-neurosis. As I\\n      understand these terms they define distinct conditions, though there is a\\n      frequent blending the one with the other. The term nervous prostration,\\n      which is a synonym of neurasthenia, defines itself; the term hysteria\\n      should be restricted to those general neuroses characterized particularly\\n      by psychical manifestations, though not infrequently by motor, sensory,\\n      secretory, vasomotor and reflex derangements as well; while the term\\n      hysteroneurosis implies the uterine origin of symptoms manifesting\\n      themselves in organs remote from the uterus without structural changes in\\n      such organs, being the direct result of reflex nervous influence starting\\n      from the uterus. The last term does not occur in the paper under\\n      discussion. From the standpoint of a gynecologist I think that this is\\n      misleading.\\n      \\n Let us see why and how it is that these\\n      three conditions (I will not call them diseases) are so frequently\\n      associated. I think that all will admit the frequent occurrence in woman\\n      of reflex symptoms, the result of pelvic lesions. An irritation staring\\n      form the pelvis is conveyed to the genito-spinal centre, thence to any or\\n      all organs with which this centre communicates. The organ oftener involved\\n      than any other is the stomach. This is shown by the frequent occurrence of\\n      nausea and vomiting following conception. The nervous system may have been\\n      previously involved, but oftener it becomes so only after the nutrition is\\n      depraved, which, sooner or later, occurs if the pelvic lesion is not\\n      removed. The depraved blood fails to supply the nerve centres with that\\n      which they need to sustain them, and they become anaemic. Prostration is\\n      but a subjective manifestation of the anaemia, and it varies in degree\\n      from a slight indisposition to the most abject helplessness.\\n      \\n If, then, nervous prostration may have\\n      its beginning in a pelvic lesion, is it possible for a pelvic lesion to be\\n      inaugurated by systemic disturbances? Personally, I believe that it is,\\n      and offer this explanation as the modus operandi by which such a lesion is\\n      induced: Marked circulatory changes nearly always attend nervous\\n      prostration. The circulation is presided over by the vaso-motor system,\\n      and wear and repair depend upon the proper regulation of this system. If\\n      it becomes disturbed, the bloodvessels dilate or contract unduly, with\\n      resulting local hyperaemia or local anaemia, as the case maybe. The\\n      climacteric flushes are the result of such disturbance. The alternate\\n      coldness and heat of the extremities, so often associated with rectal and\\n      uterine lesions, is another familiar illustration. If the brain is\\n      involved, either insomnia or drowsiness occur, depending upon whether the\\n      brain is anaemic or hyperaemic. Flatulence, gastralgia, and nervous\\n      dyspepsia result when the stomach is similarly affected. The womb and the\\n      ovaries, because of the periodical congestion imposed upon them, are\\n      oftener implicated by these unnatural circulatory disturbances than any of\\n      the pelvic organs, and in time also become unduly hyperaemic or anaemic,\\n      as the case may be.\\n      \\n It will thus be seen that nervous\\n      prostration may exist independently of pelvic lesions, or, conversely,\\n      pelvic lesions may exist independently of nervous prostration.\\n      Nevertheless, the two are frequently associated, and this fact ought, I\\n      believe, to be kept in mind in dealing with the affection known as\\n      neurasthenia. Hysterical manifestations nearly always come to the surface\\n      in nervous prostration, and they also frequently attend pelvic lesions.\\n      Indeed, the term \"hystero-psychosis\" has been coined for the\\n      purpose of defining certain psychical disturbances of presumably pelvic\\n      origin, and in the broadest sense neurasthenia is not uncommonly an\\n      hysteroneurosis. It is the frequent association of these three conditions\\n      which, it seems to me, makes it more practicable to study them conjointly.\\n      \\n The special symptoms of nervous\\n      prostration are most variable. Introspection, as Dr. Wesselhoeft has\\n      pointed out, makes of the patient a nosomaniac. The anaemic nerve centres\\n      are unduly impressionable, and a mental shock which would not seriously\\n      affect a stronger and more rugged woman falls with crushing force upon one\\n      whose nutrition is already depraved. In this way are developed disorders\\n      of sensibility, alternations of mobility, circulatory disturbances,\\n      anomalies of secretion and exertion, disorders of the gastro-intestinal\\n      canal, dermatoses, and general and psychical disturbances of all kinds.\\n      Many of these affections start from pelvic lesions, and are nearly always\\n      associated with depravity of nutrition and more or less nervous\\n      prostration.\\n      \\n Some of the worst symptoms of\\n      neurasthenia with which I have had to contend have been hyperaesthesia of\\n      the articulations, giving rise to the so-called \"hysterical\\n      joint.\" Here the prostration is usually not profound, and it is\\n      possible to apply the somewhat energetic treatment recommended by Dr.\\n      Wesselhoeft. I remember one case very distinctly, the detailed history of\\n      which I shall give in another place, which brought me much reputation\\n      because of the \"remarkable\" cure I was fortunate enough to make.\\n      \\n The patient, a beautiful girl of\\n      eighteen, had been bed- ridden for three years with supposed hip-joint\\n      disease. She was in college before assuming the ride of an invalid, and\\n      worried much over her studies and work. She sustained a fall a short time\\n      previously to taking to her bed, and to this fall the injury to the hip\\n      was attributed. She had been from physician to physician and from\\n      sanitarium to sanitarium without receiving benefit. All of the numerous\\n      medical men under whose care she had been, directed their attention to the\\n      hip and applied the classical treatment for morbus coxarius without avail.\\n      The patient had finally reached a point where introspection was her chief\\n      occupation and her mind dwelt almost continually upon a \"diseased\\n      hip.\" She was finally brought to me, coming in an invalid\\'s chair and\\n      looking the very picture of dependency. There was a slight degree of\\n      anaemia, though this was not marked. Notwithstanding the expression\\n      expression of abjectness the girl did not look seriously ill. The hip was\\n      excessively tender upon pressure, but there was no local increase of\\n      temperature, no evidences of fever and suppuration, and forcible\\n      apposition by striking the heel was not very painful. More less spastic\\n      contraction of the flexor muscles of the affected side existed, which gave\\n      to the limb an appearance of actual shortening, which was very deceptive.\\n      Hysterical symptoms were common. On examination I found the left ovary\\n      exquisitely tender. Compression of the ovary increased the pain in the hip\\n      most decidedly and gave rise to much nervous agitation. I did not,\\n      therefore, deem it wise to recommend local treatment other than the daily\\n      use of the hot douche. She had long been a victim of ovarian\\n      dysmenorrhoea. I placed upon the ankle of the affected limb three pounds\\n      of bar-lead, prescribed a pair of crutches and insisted upon her walking.\\n      The lead was used to overcome the spastic contraction as well as for its\\n      moral effect. I did not deem the joint lesion of such a character as to\\n      used extension. In two months\\' time this patient discarded her crutches\\n      for a cane. Six weeks later she put up the cane and is now perfectly well.\\n      \\n This was a case in which somewhat harsh\\n      measures were eminently appropriate.\\n      \\n In marked contrast to the case just\\n      recorded is the following: Mrs.-, aet. 47, widow for twenty years. She is\\n      a devoted church-woman, and for years was a leader in all charitable work\\n      done in the community in which she resided. Through friends she was urged\\n      to consult me, and I think that the call to the neighboring town in which\\n      she lived was countermanded at least four or five times before the finally\\n      mustered up courage and strength enough to see me. Upon reaching the\\n      bedside I found my patient in a room made dark by closed blinds, over\\n      which were hung heavy blankets to shut out every ray of light. The mirror\\n      was turned toward the wall for fear a ray of light might strike it and\\n      flesh throughout the darkened room. Nor did the patient rest under these\\n      extreme precautions, for the eyes were protected with two pairs of colored\\n      glasses with side attachments. Hyperaesthesia of the sense of hearing was\\n      equally marked and the noise was excluded from the room by double doors\\n      whose keyholes were stuffed with cotton. She l so had her ears filled with\\n      cotton, over which she wore ear-mufflers. She was emaciated to an extreme\\n      degree, and had been reduced to her miserable condition by a series of\\n      events which frequently precede profound neurasthenia. Her husband was\\n      killed during the war, and she was left childless. Twelve months previous\\n      to taking to her bed she nursed her mother through a long and fatal\\n      illness. This greatly prostrated her, yet she kept up until a favorite\\n      brother-in-law was thrown from a carriage and killed. This was the last\\n      straw, and the shock compelled her to take to her bed. In due time loss of\\n      appetite with irritability of the stomach developed, which, of course, led\\n      to marked depravity of nutrition. With the anaemia came hyperaesthesia of\\n      the special senses, spinal irritation, headache, hysterical\\n      manifestations, etc. There was no series pelvic lesion, although she had\\n      been much treated for an alleged uterine displacement with congestion.\\n      Unfortunately, she was encouraged, instead of discouraged, in her\\n      invalidism, and she soon became a nosomaniac of the worst type. She had\\n      written down her symptoms one at a time, and the record is such a typical\\n      one that I should like to give it in full, but time forbids.\\n      \\n With great difficulty the patient was\\n      moved on a cough to a private hospital and placed under the Weir Mitchell\\n      treatment. I ignored the pelvic trouble entirely. It is unnecessary to\\n      give in detail the progress of the case from day to day after this\\n      treatment was inaugurated. Suffice it to say that the improvement was of\\n      the most marked character, and in six weeks from the time she entered the\\n      hospital she walked to her carriage with her eyes and ears unprotected.\\n      She soon resumed her church and charitable work, in which she again takes\\n      much delight.\\n      \\n This woman wanted to get well. She was\\n      a woman of pure motives and high ideals. She had, in the language of Dr.\\n      Wesselhoeft, the wish, but, unaided, not the will. She required the aid of\\n      an intelligent, strong-minded, nurse who could bring to her exercise\\n      applied in such a way as to enable her to assimilate food without the\\n      expenditure of nerve force. She co- operated with her physician and nurse\\n      in every possible way, and as soon as the anaemic nerve cells became\\n      flushed with new blood she began to improve. To have commanded this\\n      patient \"to take up her bed and walk\" before improving her\\n      nutrition would have been as unscientific as to have placed the first\\n      patient in bed with extension and counter-extension applied to the limb. I\\n      know of no class of cases requiring for their successful treatment more\\n      tact and discrimination than that under consideration.\\n      \\n I feel confident that I have many times\\n      cut the affection short in its prodromal stage by removing the girl from\\n      college work and insisting upon open-air exercise. Static electricity has,\\n      in my hands, proved exceedingly useful both during the prodromal stage and\\n      that of convalescence.\\n      \\n I will conclude by saying that I have\\n      been impressed with the frequency with which an hereditary history of\\n      epilepsy has been met with in the cases of neurasthenia passing under my\\n      observation.'\n",
      " 'Tresorie - SOME OF THE DISEASES PREVENTING AND COMPLICATION PREGNANCY\\n[Diseases Preventing & Complicating Pregnancy]\\n\\n STERILITY.-DeSinety, Treub, Furbinger,\\n      et al., attribute 50 per cent. of unproductive marriages to the husbands,\\n      saying that sterility in the male is more often the cause of barren\\n      marriages than is generally supposed.\\n      \\n This cause of sterility I pass by, as\\n      also sterility due to mechanical obstruction, incomplete ovulation and the\\n      numerous other causes of this condition, too manifold for mere\\n      enumeration, to consider obesity as a causative agent in this condition. I\\n      need not say that the advocates for surgical interference for the relief\\n      of this condition are legion. Sims makes the assertion that sterility can\\n      be cured by surgical means only. That, of course, is Allopathic arguing\\n      pure and simple. Cases requiring surgical interference do arise, but any\\n      treatment which raises the nutrition of the entire organism, improves the\\n      blood-formation, and favors the resorption of pathological products in the\\n      sexual organs, is to be regarded as the indicated remedy.\\n      \\n Published statements are my authority\\n      for saying that excellent results have followed the administration of\\n      drugs, nevertheless; and in complete defiance of all therapeutic measures,\\n      a certain percentage of women remain barren; for with the more occult\\n      causes of sterility we remain, as yet, unacquainted, consequently they\\n      cannot all be reached with say kind of treatment whatever.\\n      \\n The following case I report somewhat in\\n      detail. Whilst not an exceptional case at all, it bears directly upon the\\n      subject under consideration, and possesses, it seems to me, some decidedly\\n      interesting features. My object in selecting this particular one is to\\n      call attention, if possible, to a condition not sufficiently considered.\\n      Mrs. J., aet. 26, married about two years and a half, appealed to my\\n      knowledge for a reason as to why she remained childless. The lady was\\n      carrying an excess of flesh, being under the medium height, and weighing\\n      186 pounds, but appeared to be in good health; family and previous history\\n      all that could be desired. Examination showed none of the common causes of\\n      sterility; neither, so far as I could ascertain, was the husband\\n      responsible for this unproductive condition of affairs. Some previous\\n      experiences of my own, with the added testimony of other and able men, was\\n      my reason for charging this condition of things to the excess of flesh,\\n      this, by the husband, being laughingly charged to excess of laziness.\\n      \\n We all, undoubtedly, are familiar with\\n      that peculiar disease of the blood-corpuscles which, whilst producing\\n      flesh, relaxes at the same time the muscular force; acting also, I\\n      believe, upon the muscular fibres of the uterus and upon the ovaries,\\n      inducing not only serious menstrual disorders but sterility. McKee,\\n      Philbert, and others give several instances of sterility chargeable to\\n      obesity, the women in question having been married several years without\\n      bearing children, and all became mothers after losing a portion of their\\n      flesh. If any other argument were needed in support of this theory we\\n      might turn to the quadrupeds, where we find the poorest breeders among the\\n      fleshiest animals. Fournel has a very able treatise on \"The Effects\\n      of Obesity on the Menstrual Functions and Parturition.\" Without\\n      having had any actual case of this description to deal with, he inclines\\n      very strongly towards the belief that obesity favors sterility. In the\\n      treatment of the case before mentioned, the patient was subjected to a\\n      daily massage of the entire body, with a special pelvic massage three\\n      times a week. This, in the main, consists in elevating the uterus as high\\n      as possible with the finger in the vagina, ending with a quick and decided\\n      vibratory motion. The diet received particular attention, as at this time\\n      there was a slight gastric ailment. The indicated remedy, Thuja, was given\\n      in the minimum dose. At the end of three months almost thirty pounds of\\n      flesh was gone, a considerable reduction. As an experiment, I recommended\\n      coitus in the knee-elbow position, advising that the lady remain quiet as\\n      long as possible after coition, with thighs well flexed. She became\\n      enciente, but miscarried at eight weeks. There was, comparatively\\n      speaking, but little pain and not much subsequent haemorrhage. She made a\\n      rapid recovery. Since then a living child has been born to them.\\n      \\n I believe I am safe in saying that this\\n      result would hardly have obtained were it not for the prophylactic\\n      measures adopted.\\n      \\n At the end of the first two months the\\n      patient was attacked with haemorrhage. A similar occurrence took place at\\n      irregular intervals during the following five months, the quantity of\\n      blood lost being much greater than that at the normal menstrual period.\\n      \\n For the greater part of the last five\\n      months she kept her bed, at the end of which time the tendency of the\\n      uterus to empty itself could be resisted no longer. A seven months\\' child\\n      was born, and is to-day doing well.\\n      \\n Pseudocyesis cerebral pregnancy,\\n      phantom pregnancy (whatever name we may call it by) is a disease which\\n      must come under the head of those \"complicating pregnancy.\" Mrs.\\n      M., a lady, married two or three years, aet. 29. Previous history good,\\n      always enjoying perfect health. When I first saw the lady in question she\\n      was a perfect picture of health, and, according to appearance and her own\\n      statements, about seven months pregnant. I made no examination. This\\n      appeared to be a thoroughly intelligent woman, and, according to her own\\n      statement, there was cessation of the menses. There certainly was an\\n      enlargement of the abdomen and breasts, a milky secretion, and the lady\\n      was sure that she felt foetal movement. On February 28th of the present\\n      year I was called to attend her in labor. Examination showed that no\\n      pregnancy existed. So far as I could ascertain there was no assignable\\n      origin for this condition other than nervous influences, the phenomena\\n      being purely muscular distension of the abdomen.\\n      \\n Mayham reports a case of a woman 73\\n      years old, claiming to be pregnant; he also claims that subsequently she\\n      was delivered of a child; this is an Allopathic report, however, of which\\n      we will take a Homoeopathic dose. Haultain reports three cases of cerebral\\n      pregnancy. In the first, he says no cause whatever was to be found; in the\\n      second, there was a small fibroid growth in the anterior uterine wall.\\n      Hauck reports a case where the vomiting, peristalsis, and flatus, caused\\n      by alcoholism were supposed to be caused by the pregnant state. Such cases\\n      are uncommon, but they emphasize the importance of making a thorough\\n      examination, in all cases where positive information is desired of the\\n      existence or non-existence of pregnancy.\\n      \\n Hyperemesis Gravidarum.-An animated\\n      discussion, held recently between two celebrated Allopaths of Stuttgart\\n      and Leipsic, has served to awaken a renewed interest in this subject,\\n      without in the least adding anything new to our stock of knowledge\\n      regarding its aetiology. Notwithstanding the frequency of the vomiting of\\n      pregnancy, its very distressing character in many instances, and its\\n      imminent, its very distressing character in many instances, and its\\n      imminent danger, we find but very few contributions of any value, to\\n      either the aetiology of the disorder or its therapeutics. I do not expect\\n      to add anything specially new myself, but it does seem to me that our\\n      knowledge of the vomiting of pregnancy, is to say the least, in a most\\n      contradictory state. Some physicians look upon it as a trifling matter,\\n      others as a thing to be endured, and some-these are in the right too-view\\n      even the mildest cases with gravity. Even in the mildest cases of morning\\n      sickness there is a constant drain upon the nervous system, putting the\\n      sufferer into a condition, in which she is very much less able to endure\\n      parturition than she would otherwise have been.\\n      \\n Dr. Harrison Mettler says: \"After\\n      careful inquiry I find that women who suffer from much morning sickness\\n      have as a rule, tedious or otherwise troublesome labors. I have observed\\n      in multiparae that at one time they will have much nausea and vomiting\\n      followed by a difficult labor, while at another time they will be quite\\n      free from the vomiting, and will pass through the succeeding labor with\\n      comparative ease.\" I must say my observations make me agree with Dr.\\n      Mettler entirely; when one thinks how rapidly the mildest of cases assume\\n      pernicious forms, indifference is certainly no longer to be excused. There\\n      is a voluminous literature upon this subject, and many and varied are the\\n      aetiological reasons given for this very variable affection, a large\\n      majority of writers coinciding in the opinion that \"many causes\\n      operate together,\" to produce what we are pleased to designate the\\n      \"vomiting of pregnancy.\" I believe myself that in a large\\n      percentage of cases, this pernicious vomiting is simply the result of a\\n      reflex neurosis. Undoubtedly uterine displacements frequently cause\\n      vomiting; but when this is so, and the displaced organ is raised by\\n      packing the vagina with aseptic wool, the vomiting ceases.\\n      \\n Lillie reports a number of cases, where\\n      obstinate vomiting was caused by a retroflexed uterus, and restoration of\\n      the organ caused a cessation of the disorder. Bezugloff having a\\n      persistent case of morning sickness, introduced a bougie it no the uterus,\\n      the intention being to produce abortion; the immediate result was a\\n      stoppage of the vomiting, and the pregnancy went on to full term.\\n      \\n In the case just cited, I must say that\\n      I believe it was the fright, caused by the thought of abortion being\\n      performed, more than the effects of introducing the bougie, which operated\\n      so successfully; I say now, as I said before, I believe that the\\n      pre-eminent cause of this kind of sickness must be looked for i the\\n      nervous system. Flint speaks of this form of sickness as being decidedly\\n      neurotic in its origin, and cites a number of cases of a chronic variety\\n      of dyspepsia frequently occurring in young girls. I had one such case come\\n      under my personal care. There was a persistent morning sickness, with this\\n      young lady, and a disagreeable nausea whenever food was taken; this\\n      patient was at some distance from her home, in a boarding school, and she\\n      will probably never know that the lady principal entertained very grave\\n      thoughts at one time in regard to her virtue. It certainly was very\\n      difficult to differentiate between this and the vomiting of pregnancy; it\\n      was, however, simply due to a vitiated nervous system. My theory is\\n      supported by Alt, who records a number of such cases; I cite one only, the\\n      case being that of a highly hysterical woman, six months pregnant,\\n      suffering from the gravest vomiting, and anxious that miscarriage be\\n      induced. She was making preparation for entering the hospital for this\\n      purpose, when one of her children was seized with pneumonia. The anxiety\\n      felt over the child, forced all thought of self from the mother\\'s mind;\\n      from that moment the vomiting ceased and she remained well until the\\n      termination of pregnancy.-Minchener Medicinische Wochenschrift.\\n      \\n Whilst saying that I believe this\\n      disease to be in the majority of cases of purely nervous origin, I would\\n      not imply thereby that it is not to be feared, far from it; if neglected,\\n      we know how likely it is to pass quickly beyond treatment and our patient\\n      succumb from sheer exhaustion.\\n      \\n In the treatment cited such as\\n      insertion of bougies, dilation of the os, pelvic massage, etc., I believe\\n      it is merely the \"doing something,\" no matter much what it is,\\n      so long as you have gained the confidence of your patient, that does good.\\n      We have seen how suddenly Hyperemesis will cease if the patient be\\n      alarmed; it may be, has often been, and will to again, cured by a process\\n      skin to suggestion. Kattenback had a case where the patient, a primipara,\\n      was seized with an incorrigible vomiting. It was suggested to her that her\\n      stomach contained some lumps of unwholesome material and their removal\\n      would cure her. Some milk was given her, and the stomach ceremoniously\\n      washed out. its contents bore no indications of either over-acidity or\\n      abnormal ferment She was informed that she was all right and the vomiting\\n      would not return; neither did if, and she was safely delivered at term.\\n      \\n There is a familiar and now well-know\\n      phenomena, by which these neurotics can be influenced; I speak of\\n      hypnotism; it is due to purely subjective conditions.\\n      \\n There is an identity of the hypnotic\\n      susceptibility with the condition of hysteria, and it is along these lines\\n      that we can work. Just as many times as I have tried this method of\\n      treatment, for these cases of excessive vomiting, just so many times has\\n      it given me gratifying results.\\n      \\n The patient can be to sleep by\\n      bi-ocular pressure, and the idea of cure suggested; the operation may have\\n      to be repeated several times, at intervals of a day or so, but you will be\\n      rewarded by the cessation of the vomiting, often with but one suggestion.\\n      Where the patient is not easily controlled by means of the bi-ocular\\n      pressure, Luy\\'s revolving mirror is a never failing resource.'\n",
      " 'Tresorie - PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS [Presidential Address]\\n\\n THE ROLE OF HOMOEOPATHY IN THE SECOND\\n      \\n By ALVA BENJAMIN, M.B.CH.B., F.F.HOM.\\n      \\n Such a system of medicine must\\n      recognize that it is as much an art as a science, and that healing is a\\n      relationship between two living personalities. It must recognize too, that\\n      the sick individual has to take an active part in his treatment and not be\\n      merely the passive recipient of this or that treatment. For just as it is\\n      rightly said that man does not live by alone, so should it be emphasized\\n      that man cannot be cured by medicine alone. He must see to it himself that\\n      he lives as far as possible a physically and psychically healthy life.\\n      Indeed, each individual has a power within himself to help in his own\\n      cure.\\n      \\n Do the official schools of medicine\\n      teach such an art today? I am afraid not: they are so intent on seeking\\n      the specific treatment for this or that named disease or the antibiotic\\n      that will most effectively put out of action the organism regarded as the\\n      cause of the disease, that they are losing sight of the individual\\n      himself.\\n      \\n But Homoeopathy in its persistent\\n      search for the reactions of the individual to his environment in the\\n      broadest sense, no matter of what the patient is complaining surely\\n      fulfills these requirements, especially when it is recognized that the\\n      homoeopathic potencies do not anything to the patient as do the drugs of\\n      the dominant school, but rather stimulate the patients own recuperative\\n      powers to overcome the infection or re - establish the normal metabolism\\n      which has become deranged by the illness.\\n      \\n When you consider how the homoeopathic\\n      physician diagnoses the individuality of his patient over and above the\\n      name of the disease from which he is suffering, and uses for the purpose\\n      of his prescription rather than the name of the disease this personal\\n      diagnosis of the patients mental and emotional reactions, his responses to\\n      changes in weather conditions, the alternations in his environment which\\n      influence his symptoms, etc., one realize how very individualistic is the\\n      Homoeopathic prescription fitted to that particular patient.\\n      \\n The homoeopathic physician does not\\n      seek for a remedy specific to any named disease and which he can thus\\n      apply almost automatically once he has made his organic diagnosis, which\\n      in quite an appreciable number of instances may ultimately be found to be\\n      wrong and so the treatment based upon it must therefore have been wrong.\\n      He does not, as is so often done, merely suppress the most outstanding\\n      symptom by an appropriate drug; for example giving an anodyne to mask the\\n      pain or removing the skin eruption by some strong local application, in\\n      other words putting the dust under the mat and pretending the room is\\n      clean.\\n      \\n Strangely enough the homoeopathic\\n      physician is often accused by his allopathic critic in his ignorance of\\n      Homoeopathy, of merely treating symptoms, whereas it is the critic himself\\n      who practices this superficial medicine. The homoeopathic physician, on\\n      the other hand, treats his patient as a whole through his symptoms and\\n      their modifications through changes in the environment, which is quite a\\n      different matter.\\n      \\n Homoeopathic therapy, unlike methods of\\n      treatment, is based on a natural law \"Similia Similibus\\n      Curentur\" \"Likes may be cured by likes\" which has been\\n      proved time and time again by experiment and which anyone with the will to\\n      do may prove for himself. It is not subject to constant change brought\\n      about by this or that latest discovery, and which itself will soon have to\\n      give way to the still later idea.\\n      \\n Having now introduced to you our actor,\\n      what of the scene in which he is to play his role?\\n      \\n This is the nineteen hundred and fifty\\n      - fourth year of the Christian era and the second year of the reign of our\\n      much loved and admired young Queen Elizabeth II, who will remember while\\n      in south Africa on her twenty - first birthday, before she had any idea\\n      that she would so soon be called to such an exalted position as she holds\\n      today, broadcast to the commonwealth and Empire her resolve to dedicate\\n      her life to the service of this grand community which dedication she\\n      recently repeated at her Coronation.\\n      \\n Here in Great Britain we have a more or\\n      less complete welfare state, with which idea some of us may very strongly\\n      disagree, whilst others believe such a development is the result of a\\n      natural very desirable social evolution.\\n      \\n As one necessary ingredient of this\\n      welfare state came, in 1948, the initiation of the National Health\\n      Service, through which the great majority of the population receives its\\n      medical attention, although it is rightly available to all.\\n      \\n When we come to consider the role that\\n      homoeo - therapeutics should play in this scheme, I would suggest that we\\n      should regard the problem from the purely medical aspect, forgetting any\\n      political party allegiances or sympathies we may have; or if we cannot\\n      forget them we should remember that the organization of the National\\n      Insurance Scheme of which the National Health Service is but a part, was\\n      first blue printed by the well - known Liberal supporter, Lord Beveridge,\\n      and the Health Service plans developed by the Coalition Government of all\\n      three major political parties.\\n      \\n We are living at present in an age\\n      which may very justifiably be regarded as a violent age in which have been\\n      developed so many appalling instruments of destruction, the use of some of\\n      which we are quite complacently accepting and from the use of others we\\n      are refraining, not because we consider them immoral, but simply through\\n      the fear of the wholesale destruction which would be caused by their use.\\n      We are seeing X-rays used in very high voltages in the treatment of\\n      cancer, we are being constantly remained of the use of dangerous drugs in\\n      medicine, without justification, in my opinion, bearing in mind the\\n      doubtful and evanescent ameliorations they produce and the violent\\n      surgical treatment of mental patients.\\n      \\n One further violence we should not\\n      forget is the way some of our foods are devitalized by the extraction of\\n      this or that portion of the natural product for purposes quite foreign to\\n      the well - being of the people who are to feed on them; or they are\\n      contaminated by the addition of this or that dangerous chemical, either\\n      during the growing of the plant, in the form of sprays, or as so called\\n      improvers in, for instance, the manufacture of white bread. It is very\\n      significant in this regard that quite a lot of attention is paid to the\\n      protection of the man who sprays the crops, but the right of the consumer\\n      to have uncontaminated food is slurred over by the unjustifiable statement\\n      that the amount of these chemicals so consumed is so small that it cannot\\n      have any bad effect on the consumer. We who practice Homoeopathy know how\\n      unwarranted is such a statement.\\n      \\n Can we homoeopathic physicians and\\n      patient hope to be able to do anything to make the still small voice of\\n      Homoeopathy heard in all this tumult, so that we may return to a saner and\\n      more healthful way of life and help our young Queen in her lifes work for\\n      the communitys sake?\\n      \\n Can we expect any help from the leaders\\n      of the medical profession? I am afraid not, because although I believe it\\n      accurate to state that there is a very slowly growing interest in, and\\n      tolerance of our work by individual doctors, the medical authorities are\\n      still, in their prejudice, strongly opposed to us. The London University\\n      still refuses to recognize our Hospital as a post - graduate teaching\\n      Hospital: the British Medical Association prohibits the formation of a\\n      homoeopathic section of its organization, and the Royal College of\\n      Physicians still refuses its membership to any one known as a homoeopathic\\n      physician. Yet in spite of this unfavourable environment, I firmly believe\\n      that there is a future for our method of therapeutics: but it will have to\\n      be pursued with courage, determination, foresight and energy. Surely if we\\n      believe as I do, that we are the guardians of a system of treatment\\n      destined to make our people healthier and therefore more efficient and\\n      happier, we would be failing in our duty to our country if we did not take\\n      every means in our power to acquaint the community at large with the\\n      advantages of this system and the dangers of ignoring it. This is a duty,\\n      not only of the profession, but also of the laity interested in\\n      Homoeopathy and who have experienced its benefits.\\n      \\n Every physician has two professional\\n      obligation to the community, that of preserving its health and that of\\n      endeavouring to restore it to being when it has fallen by the way.\\n      \\n The homoeopathic physician, thorough\\n      his knowledge acquired through the provings of drugs, even in\\n      infinitesimal doses, has, I believe, a very special responsibility as\\n      regards the prophylaxis of disease. It seems to me that a great deal of\\n      chronic ill health may quite conceivably be due to the manipulations of\\n      our foods and to the artificial manuring of the ground in which many of\\n      them are grown. Experiments have been carried our proving that plants\\n      grown in soil enriched by natural manuring, are much less prone to\\n      diseases than those grown with the help of artificial chemical manures. It\\n      seems a fairly justified conclusion that vegetables grown under these\\n      artificial conditions may quite well be deficient in something necessary\\n      for our perfect health. It is therefore incumbent upon the physician to\\n      advocate whenever possible the ingestion of healthily grown foods in the\\n      widest sense of that term.\\n      \\n The same duty applies when we consider\\n      the great amount of drugging in which the community at large indulges by\\n      its excessive smoking, particularly when aggravated by the practice of\\n      inhaling, and by the continued and prolonged use of drugs for this or that\\n      symptom, too often, unfortunately, though not always, on the prescription\\n      of their medical advisors.\\n      \\n There is a great lack throughout the\\n      community of any real enthusiasm for perfect health: we are only too prone\\n      to be content to follow like sheep, the unintelligent and harmful\\n      practices of the majority of our fellows.\\n      \\n Similarly in the curative realm, we\\n      homoeopathic physicians have special obligations.\\n      \\n When considering our position vis-a-vis\\n      the rest of the profession, we must never lose sight of the fact that our\\n      approach to the sick individual is a much broader and more comprehensive\\n      one than that of the dominant school. This latter prides itself on its\\n      scientific approach to its problems. One must, however, always be on ones\\n      guard against being hypnotized by that word scientific. The scientific\\n      aspect of any phenomenon or problem dealing with humanity is only one\\n      limited aspect of that problem. To get a complete picture one must\\n      consider other aspect, such as the aesthetic, emotional, maybe religious,\\n      and above all, perhaps one might say embracing all, the philosophical\\n      approach. This complex approach to his patients problem is the one that\\n      the homoeopathic physician always strives to adopt, and so never loses\\n      sight of the ego of the patient, while at the same time not forgetting his\\n      physical make - up.\\n      \\n Because this approach of ours to our\\n      patients is a much broader and more comprehensive one than the much\\n      vaunted scientific aspect, which the dominant school has come to regard as\\n      the Ultima Thule of medicine, I deplore the oft - repeated request of some\\n      of my colleagues that we should forsake our philosophy and make our work\\n      as scientific as theirs. I do not mean to imply by this that we should\\n      neglect the scientific angle of our patients illness but we should always\\n      remember that is only one facet of our problem. That is why we take such\\n      pains to diagnose our patients personality with his reaction to his\\n      environment in addition to the physical diagnosis of the case in order to\\n      arrive at our prescription for his malady. In other words, we should\\n      endeavour to lead our dominant school colleagues to our way of thinking,\\n      rather than that we should adopt theirs.\\n      \\n At the same time must always remember\\n      that if our philosophy should seem at any time to contradict so - called\\n      scientific laws, we must re - examine our philosophy, and if necessary\\n      modify it, while at the same time remembering that many times in the past\\n      what have been regarded as laws have ultimately been proved not to be so.\\n      Thus it is evident that we must never relax our self - examination.\\n      \\n What shall be the role of the\\n      homoeopathic laity?\\n      \\n The first thing for them to remember is\\n      that we are living in a democratic country whose government is dependent\\n      on the goodwill of the governed, and that, if a sufficient number of\\n      voters desire a certain line of action, that line will be adopted by the\\n      government.\\n      \\n The second thought is that there are\\n      not nearly sufficient doctors practising Homoeopathy in Great Britain to\\n      satisfy the present demand, let alone any further increased demand in the\\n      future, for this line of treatment.\\n      \\n Does not this seem strange, having\\n      regard to the great advantage to humanity that Homoeopathy provides? Not\\n      if one looks below the surface and so finds the reason for this shortage.\\n      \\n Surely the most potent reason is that\\n      Homoeopathy is not taught in the official Medical Schools, either as a pre\\n      - or post - graduate study. The London University when asked to recognize\\n      the Royal London Homoeopathic Hospital as a post - graduate Medical\\n      School, refused on the plea that as Homoeopathy was not taught in the\\n      undergraduate Medical Schools, it could not find a place for it in its\\n      post - graduate curriculum.\\n      \\n It is, of course, nonsense to suggest\\n      that a graduate should pursue his studies only in those subject of which\\n      he had already obtained some knowledge in his undergraduate days and\\n      should not wish to obtain information on any new or extra subject.\\n      \\n The University Medical Shools are\\n      enabled to a great extent through Government grants. We must therefore\\n      find some way of influencing whatever Government be in power to bring\\n      pressure to bear upon the London University to remove this obstacle to the\\n      better health of the community at large. I am quite satisfied that once\\n      this academic recognition is obtained we shave many more post - graduate\\n      students of Homoeopathy.\\n      \\n I believe than in a democratic\\n      community, having a universal State Medical Service, it is the bounden\\n      duty of the Government to remove all obstacles to the peoples obtaining\\n      that form of medical treatment in which they have confidence. So long as\\n      Homoeopathy is denied its legitimate status, so long must be Government be\\n      deemed to b failing in its duty to the country.\\n      \\n If, however, we are to achieve this\\n      desirable object of full recognition, we must all, professional and laity,\\n      be fired with enthusiasm, not only for the abstract cause of Homoeopathy,\\n      but for being partners with our young Queen in delicating our lives to the\\n      community.\\n      \\n When we do this we shall help to make\\n      this second Elizabethan era one to be remembered throughout the ages to\\n      come as surpassing the first Elizabethan era in that it gained not so much\\n      the economic and political leadership of the world - though that is not to\\n      be despised - but showed the way to the most healthful and spiritual way\\n      of life that all the world look notice and followed suit.\\n      \\n To sum up, the Role of Homoeopathy, as\\n      I see it, is to humanize the practice of medicine. By that I mean it must\\n      bring the practice of medicine into line with a reasoned philosophy of\\n      life, restore to it its artistry and rid it of all unnecessary hazards. It\\n      is to do this, not from any abstract academic sense of superiority, but in\\n      order the years to come are not those of merely another reign, but to\\n      ensure a veritable Renaissance, starting with the second Elizabethan era\\n      in which Great Britain will take its rightful place in the comity of\\n      nations as the pathfinder to a way of life for which posterity will be\\n      able to say \"Thank God for Queen Elizabeth the Second and her\\n      peoples.'\n",
      " 'Tresorie - Roentgenometric Pelvimetry [Roentgenometric Pelvimetry]\\n CHARLES W.PERKINS, M.D.\\n      \\n Norwalk, Conn\\n      \\n FOR some time the x-ray has been used\\n      to advantage in diagnosis of multiple pregnancy, position of fetus and\\n      fetal abnormalities. However, it has been only the past four or five years\\n      that any definite information has been obtained by roentgenographic\\n      methods of diagnoses in pelvimetry.\\n      \\n At the present time we are convinced\\n      that only by means of roentgenographs can be true proportions of the\\n      superior strait be determined, and that the ordinary external methods of\\n      Pelvimetry are not only occasionally misleading but proportionately\\n      inaccurate.\\n      \\n The present communication deals with\\n      the method of Herbert Thomas of Yale University. This method was developed\\n      in cooperation with the late Dr. W.A. Lafield, who was Professor of\\n      Roentgenology at the Yale Medical School.\\n      \\n Some of the reasons why roentgen\\n      pelvimetry has not been more universally adopted are probably due to the\\n      following factors.\\n      \\n (1) The majority of women will be\\n      delivered normally, whether or not pelvic measurements are made.\\n      \\n (2) The medical profession does not\\n      readily accept a new method after an established satisfactory routine has\\n      been in use.\\n      \\n (3) A new method of diagnosis incurs\\n      added expense.\\n      \\n (4) The present methods, although\\n      entirely speculative, are satisfactory in most cases.\\n      \\n (5) Roentgen pelvimetry cannot be\\n      performed by the obstetrician himself but requires the aid of a\\n      roentgenologist.\\n      \\n (6) The value of roentgenometric\\n      diagnosis is recent in origin and as yet not universally accepted.\\n      \\n If the knowledge of the size and shape\\n      of the pelvis is necessary to the practice of obstetrics, roentgen\\n      pelvimetry is a sound procedure, particularly in pre-emptors patients, and\\n      should and should be considered as an indispensable aid in these cases.\\n      \\n The method of Herbert Thoms as\\n      developed at Yale Medical School is not the only method. However, it can\\n      be classified as simple, accurate and rapid; being adaptable for use by\\n      other than experts in x-ray and obstetric diagnosis. As a technical\\n      procedure a well trained hospital technician can master its technic alter\\n      sufficient instruction.\\n      \\n Studies of recent years reveal the fact\\n      that external Pelvimetry fails to give uniform and accurate information in\\n      regard to the shape and size of the superior strait. This is often true of\\n      thin undersized individuals. In many patients of this type external\\n      measurements may suggest a contracted pelvis while the x-ray will show a\\n      relatively large pelvis with a subsequent natural labor and normal-sized\\n      child. On the other hand a stocky short person with similar external\\n      measurements will disclose a contracted pelvis which is an obstetric\\n      problem. Because of the apparent relationship between shortening of the\\n      transverse diameter and a secondary persistent occipito-posterior\\n      presentation, accurate information regarding this diameter is of clinical\\n      significance.\\n      \\n The observations of Thomas were made on\\n      twenty consecutive patients whose pelvis showed a relative or real\\n      shortening of the transverse diameter of the superior strait. In every\\n      instance a primary or secondary occipito posterior position was found\\n      after the patient was in labor. (Herbert Thoms, Surgery, Gynecology and\\n      Obstetrics, January, 1933). It therefore has been proved that an actual or\\n      relative shortening of a transverse diameter of the superior strait\\n      results in a limitation of space that is greater in the anterior than in\\n      the posterior half of the superior strait. Under these circumstances, when\\n      the head descends early in labor, the occiput is forced to rotate\\n      posteriorly.\\n      \\n The x-ray offers additional information\\n      in determining the size of the fetal head. It has been noted in x-ray\\n      examination of the unengaged fetal head that it lay with the transverse\\n      diameter of the superior strait, the occiput being either to the right or\\n      left; therefore, if roentgenogram of the patient is taken in the supine\\n      position with the fetus in the uterus, it will cast a shadow which is an\\n      enlarged profile of the head. The measurements of the occipital frontal\\n      diameter of the head can then be made. On numerous occasions this method\\n      of cephalometry, determining the diameter of the unmoulded head before and\\n      after cesarean section, has yielded accurate results. (Thomas, A.M.A.,\\n      February 24, 1934).\\n      \\n As experience increases in roentgen\\n      pelvimetry, the so-called labor test will be employed less. This, however,\\n      does not mean that the physician should not under estimate the importance\\n      of uterine contraction and the ability of the fetal head to mold. It has\\n      always followed that when something could be proved desirable in medicine\\n      for the better protection of the patient, such an advance would be\\n      demanded and eventually become routine. We may concede, therefore, that\\n      roentgen pelvimetry has a distinct place in the examination of every\\n      primiparous woman. In many instances, according to Thomas and others,\\n      external; measurements were normal but the x-ray examination revealed a\\n      contracted pelvis. On the other had, in certain patients whose external\\n      measurements suggested a cesarean section roentgen pelvimetry proved\\n      otherwise and they were subsequently delivered in a normal manner.\\n      \\n CENTIMETER GRID METHOD.\\n      \\n The procedure in this method may be\\n      summarized by stating the following:.\\n      \\n (1) The patient is placed on the\\n      roentgenographic table in the semi- recumbent position.\\n      \\n (2) The level of the superior strait\\n      above the sensitized film is established.\\n      \\n (3) The tube target is centered about\\n      five centimeters posterior to the symphysis, at thirty-two inches from the\\n      sensitized film, The exposure is made.\\n      \\n (4) The patient is removed from the\\n      table, the tube target and sensitized film remaining in situ.\\n      \\n (5) A lead plate, or centimeter grid,\\n      with perforations exactly one centimeter apart, is introduced into the\\n      same plane as that previously occupied by the superior strait and a second\\n      (flash) exposure is made on the same sensitized film as was used used in\\n      the previous exposure.\\n      \\n (6) Development of the film shows the\\n      outline of the superior strait and the shadows of the perforations, the\\n      assistance between which represents centimeters in the plane of the\\n      superior strait. The anteroposterior and transverse diameters of the\\n      superior strait in its use proportions may be drawn on centimeter-square\\n      paper by following the course of the shadow of the superior strait and\\n      transcribing it.\\n      \\n As this time I wish to express my\\n      thanks to Dr. Thoms for his personal advice and instruction which helped\\n      me to master the technic of his method.'\n",

      " 'Tresorie - THE EFFICACY OF THE VIBROMETER IN APPLYING VIBRATORY MASSAGE\\nIN AURAL DISEASES [Efficacy Of Vibrometer In Applying Vibratory Message In Aural\\nDisease]\\n\\n SINCE presenting my paper before the\\n      American Institute, in June of last year on \"Vibratory Motion as a\\n      Method of Massage in Aural Diseases,\" I have been using an instrument\\n      specially devised for that purpose called the \"vibrometer.\" This\\n      instrument is in shape like a banjo, and has four strings stretched across\\n      its length resting on a bridge, which sets upon a diaphragm. On each side,\\n      elevated above the diaphragm and supported by posts, are two horizontal\\n      bars, which support the mechanical appliances used for producing the\\n      various vibratory motions. This consists in what is called a yoke, in\\n      which revolves a shaft connected with the electro-motor by pulley-wheels\\n      and a belt. Behind the diaphragm is a shallow air-tight compartment,\\n      leading from which are rubber tubes that are inserted in the external\\n      auditory canal during treatment, consequently any vibratory motion of the\\n      diaphragm, which must necessarily be an inward and a corresponding outward\\n      movement, would be exactly reproduced upon the membrana tympani, as the\\n      confined air, not being able to escape, will undergo an alternate\\n      condensation and rarefication in the external auditory canal.\\n      \\n Every vibratory movement of the strings\\n      of the instrument is communicated to the diaphragm by means of the bridge\\n      upon which it rests. These strings by varying their tension and length can\\n      be regulated to give a high or low rate of vibration as desired, for\\n      instance, the heaviest string left at its original length adjusted to a\\n      slight tension may make about fifty vibratory motions to the second, while\\n      the highest string on the instrument adjusted to a high tension and\\n      clamped down to one-fourth its original length would probably make three\\n      thousand vibratory motions to the second.\\n      \\n In the centre of the diaphragm is an\\n      attachment which works on a lever, and when hit by the cam on the\\n      revolving shaft lifts the diaphragm to a considerable extent, causing a\\n      powerful effect on the membrana tympani. This attachment can be adjusted\\n      at four different leverages, which causes a modification or increase of\\n      its intensity and can be regulated at from one to twenty-five vibratory\\n      movements to the second. This is only used in very bad cases and for not\\n      more than five minutes continuously.\\n      \\n The instrument which I have been\\n      describing in an improvement on the first manufactured, and as far as I\\n      know, is the only one which offers the same facilities for applying this\\n      method of massage. The class of patients in my experience who are\\n      generally benefited from the first, are those in which the mucous membrane\\n      lining the tympanic cavity and Eustachian tubes is in a hypertrophic\\n      condition. The membrana tympani are depressed, opaque, and thickened. They\\n      usually complain of a stiffed sensation in the ears, with a great deal of\\n      tinnitus aurium, and that their hearing is worse during a cold. In cases\\n      where the mucous membranes are atrophied with a large external auditory\\n      canal perfectly dry and Eustachian tubes patulous, and generally very\\n      little tinnitus, this or no other treatment has done very much good in the\\n      majority of cases, and in looking ever my records I find that only about\\n      five per cent. have been relieved, while in the before-mentioned cases the\\n      good results reach at least seventy-five per cent. In treating persons, I\\n      always select the rate of vibration which corresponds in pitch, if\\n      possible, to that caused by the diseased condition of the ears. If there\\n      is no tinnitus to guide me, I find whether the patient can hear a high or\\n      low sound better; if it is a low sound, a high rate of vibration is used\\n      in treatment, and vice versa, A point which I would like to explain here\\n      is this: It is not necessary that the sound from the instrument should be\\n      of the same quality of the tinnitus experienced by the patient, but merely\\n      the same pitch. for instance, if a banjo, where one of the strings was\\n      adjusted when sounded to produce a certain note, and a musical instrument\\n      of any other kind, whose quality of tone was entirely different, was made\\n      to sound the same note in a room, the string on the banjo would vibrate in\\n      sympathy, which has been proven by experiment, any other note, no matter\\n      how loud, would have no effect. Another point is in the way the strings of\\n      the vibrometer are set in motion. On the revolving shaft is a wheel\\n      projecting from which are metallic picks which hit the string it is\\n      adjusted over. It does not make any difference in the number of vibratory\\n      motions per second, whether the string is hit fast or slow, but at the\\n      time the string is first hit the intensity is greater than it is just\\n      before being hit again, and as the motion of the wheel is perfectly\\n      rhythmic, revolving so many times to the second, it has just as good an\\n      effect as if the intensity during the fraction of a second did not vary at\\n      all. The idea of using vibratory motion, as I have said before, originated\\n      within my mind some years ago, and later put into practical operation, and\\n      as far as I know, was the first to lay before the profession in a\\n      scientific manner, this method of massage.\\n      \\n I have found that when two of the\\n      strings upon the vibrometer were regulated in such a way that when both\\n      were set in vibration at the same time, producing the sensation of a\\n      harmonious sound, the effect in some cases on the tinnitus was especially\\n      beneficial, relieving, where the various kinds of vibrations produced by a\\n      single string failed. Sub-acute cases of deafness, accompanied by tinnitus\\n      aurium, are quickly relieved, as the following case will illustrate:.\\n      \\n Mrs. M. Young, married lady, aet. 26,\\n      called at my office, April 1, 1893, complaining of partial deafness and\\n      tinnitus aurium. She had a stuffed sensation, or as if cotton had been\\n      packed in the external auditory canal. She says the tinnitus was so\\n      annoying as to prevent sleep. On examination, found considerable\\n      retraction of the membrana tympani, and hearing for the watch, on the\\n      right side five inches, on the left, seven inches. The Eustachian tube\\n      were partially closed, which made inflation somewhat difficult, giving\\n      slight relief. I used several of the vibrations on the different strings\\n      without immediate benefit.\\n      \\n April 4th.-She came again, and reported\\n      that no improvement had taken place. I again inflated her ears, after\\n      which she sat down to the vibrometer. The central attachment was used with\\n      considerable force continuously for four minutes, after which she declared\\n      that the tinnitus had entirely ceased in the right ear, and greatly\\n      modified in the left; the hearing for the watch had increased for both\\n      ears to fourteen inches, and the stuffed sensation had almost entirely\\n      disappeared. On inspection of the membrana tympani, found them\\n      comparatively very slightly retracted. On April 8th, found improvement had\\n      continued, when the same treatment was used for three minutes; after which\\n      she declared herself completely relieved of the tinnitus and stuffed\\n      sensation, with hearing powerfully restored. Saw her again on April 13th,\\n      when she declared the good results from last treatment to have still\\n      continued.\\n      \\n I find that in the majority of cases,\\n      when the strings of the instrument are used it is only necessary to strike\\n      them lightly with the friction wheel. In vibrating the heavy string, I\\n      generally set the bridge back behind the central attachment, and adjusting\\n      the motor in such way that the belt is at a considerable tension, so that\\n      the pulley-wheel revolves slowly. I also generally use this adjustment\\n      when setting in motion two strings at one time. The principle of this\\n      method of treatment embraces two essential features which to my mind makes\\n      this system of massage the only scientific one applicable to the membrana\\n      tympani and its associate sound-conducting parts. Message is the\\n      application of motion to disease, and its scientific administration\\n      consists of its application in a systematic manner. In applying massage in\\n      aural diseases, it is necessary to produce a to-and-fro movement of the\\n      membrana tympani, and, if possible, by a force which is harmless and at\\n      the same time effective. The vibrometer fulfils these conditions. Any of\\n      the strings on the instrument that may be set in motion by the\\n      friction-wheel, will produce a certain number of vibratory movements to\\n      the second of time, and the movements of the central attachment are also\\n      measured. What could be more systematic than this? The motions of the\\n      membrana tympani were intended by nature to its vibratory, and as the\\n      vibrometer generates measured motion, and these motions are vibratory,\\n      theoretically we have a scientific and effective method of massage in\\n      aural diseases; and, as demonstrated practically by the use of the\\n      vibrometer, we have in fact a great scientific advance over all previous\\n      methods. Since the introduction of this treatment in aural diseases, it\\n      makes possible a more or less benefit in cases of deafness heretofore\\n      considered hopeless, and has opened up the field for the treatment of\\n      aural diseases to such an extent that the number of deaf patients seeking\\n      relief at the aurist\\'s hands will at least double itself.\\n      \\n DISCUSSION.\\n      \\n H.C. HOUGHTON, M.D.: Dr. Garey\\'s\\n      admirable paper gives us the description of the vibrometer, an instrument\\n      devised under his personal direction and inspection, for the purpose of\\n      applying massage to the ear. It is the only instrument of the kind on the\\n      market, so far as I am aware, and after a somewhat prolonged use of it, I\\n      am prepared to recommend the latest production of the vibrometer company.\\n      \\n This instrument is a decided\\n      improvement over the instrument first sent out, and is capable of\\n      producing a most profound effect upon the drum-head and ossicula; indeed,\\n      upon the entire auditory apparatus. I am able to confirm Dr. Garey\\'s\\n      statement of the effect of high and low vibrations us regards treatment.\\n      \\n I have also been very much interested\\n      in the use of stringed or reed instruments for diagnosis, and find that we\\n      can detect any abnormal sensitiveness of the auditory nerve to high or low\\n      tones. Some patients are extremely sensitive to all tones, high or low;\\n      others to high tones and not to low tones; others, conversely. Again, in\\n      some instances, there is a peculiar sensitiveness to single tones or to\\n      discords produced by sounding the note and half-note at the same time.\\n      Under the action of the central attachment of the vibrometer this\\n      sensitiveness is modified, the sensitiveness to high tones disappearing\\n      and being replaced by a low tone or, conversely, under treatment, a low\\n      tone disappears and a high tone is established, temporarily, at least.\\n      Again, in cases of recent origin, treatment will substitute an undefined\\n      rushing sound for a definite musical tone, either high or low, and later,\\n      the treatment will abolish this, the patient being relieved of this\\n      intensely annoying symptom. In some cases, with this relief, there is an\\n      improvement in the audition; in other cases, no improvement follows.\\n      \\n I confess to the domination of the\\n      material over my mind in my earlier experience with massage, and I think\\n      the inclination of operators will be to use a far greater degree of power\\n      than is necessary. I therefore notice with great satisfaction Professor\\n      Garey\\'s remark that \"the object should be to produce a to-and-fro\\n      motion to the membrana tympani, and, if possible, by a force which is\\n      harmless and at the same time effective.\" I would hardly say\\n      \"to-and-fro motion of the drum-head,\" because I think that the\\n      expression is liable to perpetuate the motion which is fixed in the minds\\n      of most physiologists, that the drum-head moves as a whole, with a\\n      to-and-fro motion.\" That is true under the influence of the Politzer,\\n      Siegle\\'s otoscope and similar instruments; but it certainly does not so\\n      move in the ordinary function of audition, but stands as the iris does in\\n      the eye, as an adjustor, a regulator of sound-force; in some sense as the\\n      iris does in its relation with the lens, to adjust, regulate and direct\\n      the essential force, and the vibration of the drum-head is at every node;\\n      every portion receives impressions that are converted into molecular\\n      disturbances of varying lengths, according as they are produced upon the\\n      stiff and unyielding portions of the drum-head at the periphery, along the\\n      manubrium, or in the more attenuated and easily-yielding portions which\\n      the between these two areas. Not only so, but these impulses are\\n      communicated to the contained air of the tympanum, and make their\\n      impression upon the acoustic nerve through the round window synchronously\\n      with the impression made through the ossicula.\\n      \\n This whole subject widens before my\\n      mind in such a way that one might wish himself twenty years and at liberty\\n      to devote himself to a term of research in acoustics, such as is offered\\n      only in the technical schools of the continent of Europe.\\n      \\n WM. R. KING, M.D.: In discussing Dr.\\n      Garey\\'s paper I shall begin by saying that his methods have been closely\\n      followed by me since the beginning of his experiments, owing to the fact\\n      that I have been greatly interested in the treatment of deafness and\\n      tinnitus by means of sound waves or by aural massage since 1887, and have\\n      experimented and treated many cases by this method since then, though with\\n      crude and unsatisfactory instruments. Since using the vibrometer-which,\\n      after much study and experimentation, is now presented to the profession\\n      in practical shape-I have undoubtedly increased my percentage of good\\n      results.\\n      \\n I don\\'t believe I am over-sanguine or\\n      carried away by interest in this method, and believe I can rightly\\n      appreciate that this does not offer us a panacea or cure-all for auditory\\n      ailments, and hope I may always be ready to see the failures and to strive\\n      to find methods or remedies to reach some of them.\\n      \\n In speaking of the application of the\\n      instrument, I wish to call attention to the central attachment or post foe\\n      vibrations. Dr. Garey has not given it as much attention in the paper as\\n      it deserves. It is very useful as a general means of aural massage,\\n      rougher in nature and more general in application than the strings which\\n      help to make up the instrument. I often use it before applying the\\n      \"similar found\" to a given case, as a species of gymnastics, to\\n      stimulate secretion and motion in the conducting apparatus of the ear,\\n      viz., membrana tympani and ossicles. In most cases-in fact, in all-where\\n      tinnitus is present, I follow this up immediately by the nearest approach\\n      to the similar pitch obtainable.\\n      \\n I agree thoroughly with Dr. Garey, that\\n      the best results are achieved in cases accompanying hypertrophic catarrh,\\n      and that the least benefit is apparent in cases of atrophic nature.\\n      \\n Regarding the method of treatment in\\n      the absence of tinnitus, my experience the does not coincide with that of\\n      the author of the paper entirely; I do not feel that as yet we have any\\n      safe rule to guide us. My method has been to try the numerous sounds and\\n      variations the of until I find the one that seems to give the best\\n      immediate results, or that the patient himself will speak of as very\\n      penetrating and powerful )though not necessarily loud and heavy).\\n      \\n It seems almost impossible at present\\n      to simulate all the qualities of tone as they occur in the ears of those\\n      suffering with tinnitus; in fact, it would appear to be unnecessary.\\n      However, it seems advantageous and quite necessary to secure the closest\\n      simulation of pitch, thus in many cases soon obliterating annoying\\n      tinnitus and improving hearing powers.\\n      \\n The arrangement permitting of the\\n      picking of two strings simultaneously adds decidedly the usefulness of the\\n      instrument, as it increases the range of pitch as well as varying the\\n      quality of tones procurable, thereby decidedly enlarging our field of\\n      application.\\n      \\n The force used for creating the message\\n      or gymnastics of the membrana tympani and the ossicles-viz, vibratory\\n      force or sound- carefully and scientifically applied, is nature\\'s remedy,\\n      because it is adapted by nature, and is the only force which can rightly\\n      or safely be applied to these delicate portions of this complex organ of\\n      hearing.\\n      \\n A startling commentary on this subject\\n      is the array of cases benefited who have been relegated to the shelf by\\n      ancient and modern otology; cases declared unhelpable have been vastly\\n      improved. Pray, make no mistake; I did not say all cases.\\n      \\n It may be interesting to hear the\\n      latest regarding the instrument which was first invented for the\\n      application of this method of aural massage Mr. E.J. Godman, the inventor\\n      and patentee, is constantly on the lookout, and always striving for\\n      improvements to his machine. He has made many that you all know of. Permit\\n      me to report a few so recent they have not yet left the factory.\\n      \\n First.-The machine has been taken from\\n      its case, and is now mounted on a solid stand or table of oak, being set\\n      below the level, or so that the face of the instrument is just level with\\n      the face of the table. This is all supported by rigid, solid metal legs,\\n      which absolutely prevent foreign vibrations.\\n      \\n Second.-The motor has been removed from\\n      its little shelf and relegated below the table. I t can be placed upon a\\n      box on the floor, a shelf against the wall, or, better yet, a shelf\\n      solidly attached to the metal supports of the table. A belt goes up\\n      through an aperture to a wheel on a shaft, the other extremity of which\\n      carries a wheel with a rubber tire (a friction wheel), which in its\\n      revolution, being in contact with a larger flat- surfaced wheel on the\\n      main shaft of the instrument, turns this in harmony with itself. This\\n      arrangement does away with the necessity of shifting the motor each time\\n      you wish to shift the carriage from one string to another- a consummation\\n      to be devoutly thankful for. The removal of the motor from the instrument\\n      as at present attached will recommend itself to all who have used the\\n      vibrometer, a great amount of undesirable jar being thus avoided.\\n      \\n Third.-Ratchet keys capable of very\\n      fine adjustment of tension of strings are now provided for the instrument.\\n      \\n Fourth.-A rheostadt or resistance-coil\\n      is now to be placed beneath the table between the storage battery and the\\n      switch, by this means enabling us to control the speed and number of\\n      revolutions to a nicety.\\n      \\n Other, though comparatively minor,\\n      improvements are being made, and others are contemplated, as, for\\n      instance, the substitution of a roughly corrugated rubber band for the\\n      picker on the wheel, thereby getting rid of the metallic sound of the\\n      picker on the wire strings.\\n      \\n I have experimented with a number of\\n      appliance for the production of the sounds and pitches that I have\\n      required, but I always fall back on the vibrometer, especially as at\\n      present constructed, for satisfactory work and results.\\n      \\n This instrument may be, and probably\\n      is, as yet, in its infancy. It, and the method it applies, can only be\\n      perfected by constant work and experimentation both on the part of the\\n      profession and of the manufacturers. Each improvement we can suggest, if\\n      it only should serve as a means of helping one solitary case, would be\\n      well worth our while.\\n      \\n The experiments being made by different\\n      methods for treating deafness by sound waves is indicative of the interest\\n      the profession has taken in the matter. It is indicative of a lack of\\n      something in our usual armamentarium which is greatly longed for by\\n      patient and doctor; that is, the means for making the deaf hear and for\\n      relieving distressing tinnitus. There has been a dearth in this direction,\\n      and perhaps there still is, but I believe fully that we have in aural\\n      massage by vibratory force a decided acquisition at our hands.\\n      \\n E. H. LINNELL., M.D.: I would simply\\n      like to ask Dr. King how long he uses the instrument, and whether he uses\\n      it according to the deafness.\\n      \\n DR. KING: Yes, decidedly. In an intense\\n      case of deafness I would have to use it a great deal longer. The central\\n      attachment I never carry over three or five minutes, and the whole\\n      treatment I don\\'t think is over carried over twenty or twenty-five minutes\\n      in one case, and usually averages from ten to fifteen.\\n      \\n HAROLD WILSON, M.D.: I have only to\\n      suggest, what I have elsewhere called attention to, the possibility of\\n      another mechanical device for securing vibratory motion. It is well known\\n      that in the make and break of a current of electricity, in the circuit of\\n      which there is a telephone, we get an influence upon the make and break of\\n      the current in the telephone. Now, it is a simple matter with which these\\n      makes and breaks are made as to obtaining any number of vibration that you\\n      wish. You may, by a mechanical device of some rotary motion, if you\\n      choose, make and break the current as rapidly as you please until you have\\n      reached several thousand vibrations a second, or you may even make the\\n      vibrations so slow us to be easily counted. The application of this\\n      suggestion has been put in force in my own practice, more or less, in the\\n      use of the telephone as connected with the induction-coil ordinary\\n      battery. The more intense the current, the more intense the sound. You can\\n      easily see that it is mere question of mechanics to secure these two\\n      sounds-intensity of vibration and rapidity of vibration. I will say,\\n      furthermore, that it has this advantage. There is no noise in the office,\\n      which I think is not altogether true of the vibrometer. I would suggest\\n      that so far as the vibrometer is concerned, if it could be made to be\\n      noiseless to anybody but the patient, it would be a decided improvement.\\n      In that respect the telephone is a decided improvement, because there is\\n      no noise except to the patient, because the noise is right at the ear of\\n      the patient. If I were seeking for a perfected instrument in this line, I\\n      would go outside of the banjo idea. As we have the most perfect writing\\n      machines, which have no connection with the ordinary method of writing,\\n      and sewing machines, which have no connection with sewing by hand, so it\\n      occurs to me that possibly the securing of he vibratory motion upon the\\n      ears might be obtained in a totally different way from that which you get\\n      when you listen to the drum of the guitar or an ordinary musical\\n      instrument, and I would suggest that the make and break of a telephone\\n      open a very fruitful field for mechanical experimentation.\\n      \\n H.C. HOUGHTON, M.D.: In my study of\\n      this subject I made the acquaintance of Mr. Bernhardt, of New York City,\\n      who is a personal friend of Mr. Emil Berliner, the inventor of the Emil\\n      Berliner Telephone, which is the instrument by which the Bell Telephone\\n      Company maintain their monopoly at present. Mr. Berliner is the inventor\\n      of the graphophone, and has, I think, covered this whole matter which Dr.\\n      Wilson has mentioned. As ordinary Bell telephone receiver is put into the\\n      circuit of an ordinary induction machine, and you can use it just as the\\n      English people use the audiometer, and as you remove the coil you modify\\n      the vibrations, which is covered with another disk and a tube, and that\\n      tube covered with a stethoscope tube, which is the same as we use for the\\n      phonograph or vibrometer, and, as Dr. Wilson has suggested, you can modify\\n      the intensity, and of course the whole matter is adjusted by the\\n      attachment of the cord, so that you can have fine vibrations. The\\n      intensity of the vibrations is regulated by the distance to which you\\n      uncover the cord. The only difficulty in the adjustment is that it has\\n      been so severe that it is really uncomfortable, and the noise of the\\n      instrument is reduced to the minimum for office use.\\n      \\n A.B. NORTON, M.D.: I will also add that\\n      in regard to the objection Dr. Wilson makes to the noise, there is no\\n      doubt it is an annoying thing in the office, and in that line I have some\\n      men at work on my suggestion. We are devising another machine, or\\n      instrument, which is to be entirely enclosed in a cabinet, so there will\\n      be no noise whatever in the room if it is made a success. The idea is a\\n      little crude, and I am quite uncertain whether it will amount to anything\\n      or not. Then, in the line of what Dr. King was speaking in regard to Mr.\\n      Goodwin-he called, at New York, to see me last week. I made two little\\n      suggestion to him, which I think would be in line with his advancement.\\n      One is the number of the picks. The present vibrometer has four picks I\\n      suggest the experiment of trying twelve or sixteen picks, which will make\\n      a more continuous sound; it may be of some value. Then, in regard to\\n      regulating the speed of the machine: you regulate that now by a series of\\n      buttons, so as to get three different speeds. We will have a very slight,\\n      intermediate speed, and a very rapid speed. My experience with the\\n      vibrometer is especially favorable. I think the idea is in the right\\n      direction, and it is simply a matter of instrumentation.']\n",

Dietary sources of vitamin C include fruits and vegetables, particularly citrus fruits such as oranges.Severe deficiency of vitamin C causes scurvy. Although rare, scurvy results in severe symptoms and can cause death. People with scurvy are treated with vitamin C and should be under medical supervision.Many uses for vitamin C have been proposed, but evidence of benefit in scientific studies is lacking. In particular, research on asthma, cancer, and diabetes remains inconclusive, and a lack of benefit has been found for the prevention of cataracts or heart disease.The use of vitamin C in the prevention or treatment of colds remains controversial. Extensive research has been conducted. Overall, vitamin C lacked an effect on the development of colds and on cold symptoms. However, the duration of the cold shortened slightly. Notably, people living in extreme circumstances, including soldiers in the subarctic, skiers, and marathon runners, had a 50% decrease in the risk of developing a cold. This area merits additional research and may be of particular interest to athletes or people in the military.'\n",

Vitamin B12 is frequently used in combination with other B vitamins in a vitamin B complex formulation. Vitamin B12 is important in DNA synthesis. Vitamin B12 is bound to the protein in food. Acid in the stomach releases B12 from protein during digestion. Once released, B12 combines with a substance called intrinsic factor (IF) before it is absorbed into the bloodstream.The human body stores several years\\' worth of vitamin B12 in the liver, so low levels in the body are rare. Decreases in vitamin B12 levels are more common in the elderly, HIV-infected persons, and vegetarians. Inability to absorb vitamin B12 from the intestinal tract can cause a type of anemia called pernicious anemia. Fever and symptoms of \"excessive sweating\" have been reported with anemia due to low levels of vitamin B12; however, these are fixed with vitamin B12 treatment.'\n",

This is based on results. They are not\\n      hopeless cases; they are still hopeful and they get well under\\n      radiotherapy. This has happened during the last three years, not because I\\n      have changed any but because the method of radiotherapy has changed. A\\n      great change has taken place. First of all, radium and x-rays are no\\n      longer looked on a last resort.\".\\n      \\n The foregoing bears witness to the\\n      progress made in the field radiation therapy. The manufacture of more\\n      adequate apparatus and the improved technic in its use reflect this\\n      improvement. Machines are used generally delivering twenty to thirty\\n      milliamperes of current at 200 K.V., while machines operating at 750 to\\n      1,000 200 K.V., using lower milliamperes, have been installed in several\\n      places in this country. Since the question of increased voltages began to\\n      dominate the field, machines operating at 400 to 600 K.V., using sealed\\n      tubes, have been manufactured in this country as well as on the been\\n      manufactured in this country as well as on the continent. This higher\\n      powered machines occupy little more space than the usual 200 K.V. machine.\\n      \\n The effectiveness of these stronger\\n      radiations is thought to be due to (1) the increased penetration and its\\n      consequently larger percentage depth doses, (2) the supposed higher\\n      selective action of short have length radiation on malignant cells, and\\n      (3) greatly increased x-ray output. Clinics using super-voltages report\\n      that clinical results are somewhat better than those secured through the\\n      use of the lesser voltage machine.\\n      \\n Experimental effort, from the physical\\n      and biologic point of view, has been exerted to establish to standard\\n      basis for radiotherapy since Roentgens discovery thirtyfive years ago, and\\n      its application five years later. Radiotherapists have only recently begun\\n      to understand the principles of clinical application or radiotherapy in\\n      the treatment of malignant conditions.\\n      \\n Regaud selected the rabbits testicle\\n      for his experiments because its histologic cellular structure was highly\\n      sensitive to radiation, containing cells which are in a state of active\\n      mitosis resembling that of malignant tissue. In 1922, Regaud reported that\\n      of malignant, tissue. In 1922, Regaud reported that it was impossible to\\n      sterilize the testicle by a single dose of radiation without causing\\n      serious damage to the overlying skin. The dose required to produced such\\n      radio necrosis was equivalent to about three radionecrosis was equivalent\\n      to about three erythemas when administered in one dose. However, by\\n      dividing the dose in such a manner as to prolong the treatment over a\\n      period of fourteen days, a total dose of about five erythemas could be\\n      given causing complete sterilizations without damage to the skin. Thus it\\n      is seen that by prolonging the time of treatment the cutaneous dose could\\n      be increased nearly 50 per cent without causing necrosis.\\n      \\n The above experiments were reported,\\n      and the same results determined, by Schinz and Slotopolsky in 1926, and\\n      again by Regaud and Ferroux in 1927. These experiments formed the\\n      foundation for the clinical studies of Pfahler (America), Hohlfelder\\n      (Germany) and Coutard (France), who have swung the pendulum from massive\\n      radiation, as advocated by the German school, to that of the protected\\n      fractional dose method. Results have been achieved by this method which\\n      are superior to previously reported; these are obtained by the improved\\n      method of administering a large dose to the (3 days) without causing\\n      destructive effects to the surroundings normal structure (or cancer bed);\\n      its effect are rather biologic than physical. The clinical application of\\n      the method of radiation by Pfahler, Countard, and Berven (Sweden) in the\\n      treatment of cancer of the tonsil, pharynx and larynx and have proved the\\n      radio-sensitive properties of squamous carcinoma, previously considered\\n      incapable of of responding to radiation.\\n      \\n According to Coutard, the neoplasm is\\n      exposed to x-rays twice daily, giving a total dose of 350 r to400 r to two\\n      areas, using 190 to 200 k.v., four milliamperes, two millimeters of copper\\n      and three millimeters of aluminum filtration at a distance of fifty of\\n      sixty centimeters, for lesion of the head and neck. For deeply situated\\n      lesions, such as cancer of the uterus, the focal distance varies from 80\\n      to 100 centimeters, the area of the field for the head and neck conditions\\n      being only 50 to 100 square centimeters, while those of the lower abdomen\\n      require on an average of 250 to 300 square centimeters. For the\\n      sterilization of the radio-sensitive squamous carcinomatous growth, a\\n      depth dose of 3,000 r to 4,000 r is given, while stronger dose is\\n      necessary for the radio-resistant tumors.\\n      \\n In the course of treatment of principle\\n      guides a radio reaction of the covering epithelium and the radio reaction\\n      of the cancer cells. The radio reaction of the cutaneous epithelium is\\n      called \"radio epidermitis.\"characterized by loss of epithelial\\n      layers and denudation of the dermis. The reaction of the mucous membrane ,\\n      called \"radio epithelitis,\" manifests itself by loss of the\\n      epithelial layer sand denudation of the mucous membrane, epithelial layers\\n      and denudation of the corium which becomes covered by a fibrinous and\\n      false membrane; of clear. The duration of both describe radio reactions is\\n      six weeks. Each appears at the beginning of three weeks and disappears at\\n      the beginning of the ninth week.\\n      \\n Should the total or daily dose or the\\n      intensity per minute be too high, or the filtration or the tension too\\n      low, the cancer bed would be modified. the nutrition of the malignant\\n      cells becomes impaired The cellular radio- sensitivity, which seems to be\\n      linked up not only with the mitosis of the cell but above all with the\\n      activity of their interchange with the cell but above all with the\\n      activity of their interchange with the surrounding normal structures,\\n      becomes diminished and at times suppressed. The cancer cells become\\n      incentive to radiation. This phenomenon is called \"radio-\\n      vaccination\" by Regaud.\\n      \\n Observation of clinical facts shows\\n      that changes in the surrounding normal tissue result from excessive daily\\n      doses and intensity per minute per minute causing radio resistance of the\\n      tissue. Conversely, radio- sensitivity would be prolonged with a smaller\\n      daily dosage and the resultant extended period.\\n      \\n Realizing that better results may be\\n      obtained by prolonged treatment, Coutard and his collaborators in the last\\n      few years have begun to extend the duration of treatment of certain\\n      so-called radio-resistant cancers from thirty to ninety days, giving weak\\n      daily doses in order of about 175, 220, 225 and 250 r per day, dividing\\n      the dose in two treatments. By this method he was able to cure a certain\\n      number of lesions on which he had not been able previously to obtain the\\n      same results, such as very differentiated epidermoid epithelioma invading\\n      the muscles and cartilages, glandular epithelioma of the breast ad the\\n      thyroid body, and special round celled epitheliomas of the upper part of\\n      the ethmoid and the adjacent sinuses. This mode of prolonged treatment not\\n      only controlled the condition locally but it lessened the frequency of\\n      metastasis.\\n      \\n When radiating a cancer of very\\n      embryonic, very radio-sensitive growths, the energy factor is predominant.\\n      The action of the x-rays seems to be direct and rapid; the treatment can\\n      be accomplished within fifteen to twenty days. The cells are destroyed and\\n      generally normal structures are affected very little. When radiating the\\n      less embryonic type of growths, the time of treatment should be longer.\\n      \\n Pursuing these general principles, I\\n      have adopted the Countard method with some slight modifications. The cures\\n      which I shall illustrate will show that the percentage of cures in a\\n      number of most dangerous epidermoid carcinomas has markedly increased and\\n      that some conditions formerly considered hopeless have been temporarily\\n      cured. In conclusion I wish to emphasize the following facts:.\\n      \\n (1) Cure of cancer by x-rays is still\\n      difficult and must not be entered into lightly and causally.\\n      \\n (2) Radiotherapy is just as radical in\\n      method as surgery, and requires great skill, judgment and experience.\\n      \\n (3) The cooperation of the pathologist\\n      and the radiotherapist is imperative for a proper estimate of the\\n      radio-sensitivity in relation to treatment of the lesion.\\n      \\n (4) Daily examination of the patient is\\n      necessary; modification of the normal structure and general reaction by\\n      the x-ray treatment sometimes appears to quickly that it is often\\n      necessary to diminish the daily dose or the size of the field in the\\n      course of treatment.\\n      \\n (5) There exists no fixed method of\\n      treatment, only a simple clinical treatment for each individual patient\\n      and for the special type of tumor..\\n      \\n (6) Improvement in roentgen apparatus\\n      of higher voltages, producing more penetrating rays, will permit a better\\n      relation between destruction of malignant cells and preservation of the\\n      supporting, and the radio sensitivity of the tumor may be prolonged.'\n",

But why is it not spreading sufficiently and\\n      adequately in our motherland or in fact anywhere in the world? Why is our\\n      National Government not still keen on according official recognition to\\n      this superb system of healing art or providing ways and means for its\\n      development and diffusion? Why the public opinion is not gaining strength\\n      enough to put sufficient pressure on our Government to take interest in\\n      it? Why sufficient number of fully equipped Homoeopathic teaching\\n      institutions and hospitals are not growing to turn out adequate number of\\n      fully qualified Homoeopathic physicians in the country?\\n      \\n It is high time that we should draw the\\n      attention of the profession and the laity to provide answers to so many\\n      \"whys\" and to solve the pressing problems in the matter\\n      concerned. On a cursory view it becomes evident that the Homoeopathic\\n      profession, the people and the Government are each individually and\\n      collectively responsible for this impasse.\\n      \\n The so - called Allopathy still\\n      occupies the dominant place in any country, even in the land of birth of\\n      Homoeopathy. It is no wonder that Homoeopathy, being a discovery of merely\\n      a century and a half still lags behind its rival shool. But it is a wonder\\n      of wonders that Homoeopathy has already encompassed the whole world within\\n      such a short period since it was ushered into existence by Hahnemann.\\n      History of man reveals that nowhere a new truth was accepted by him easily\\n      and readily, obsessed as he is with conservatism, tradition, authority and\\n      vested interests. Nonetheless the triumphant march of Homoeopathy with a\\n      such a meteoric speed throughout the length and breadth of the world is a\\n      proof positive of the truth inherent in the system and phenomenal\\n      therapeutic efficacy of this healing art. It is one more glaring instance\\n      of mans love of truth against heavy odds that impede his progress at every\\n      step.\\n      \\n For the propagation of any new truth\\n      and its acceptance by man, in general, the first and foremost condition is\\n      the turning out of sufficient number of persons who have realised the\\n      truth and are adept in the practice of it. This involves establishment of\\n      a sufficient number of teaching institutions which will turn out experts\\n      in the science and art of Homoeopathy; and a sufficient number of\\n      Homoeopathic Hospital where, the efficacy of this system of treatment will\\n      be put to test.\\n      \\n Human knowledge is becoming\\n      unmanageably vast. The appearance of specialists has become indispensable.\\n      So special Hospitals for the treatment of specific types of diseases have\\n      sprung forth elsewhere, e.g. Tuberculosis Hospitals, Cancer Hospitals,\\n      Hospital for Tropical Diseases etc. Because of organisation of these\\n      hospitals people generally think of getting themselves treated in these\\n      institutions. As there are no fully - equipped general Homoeopathic\\n      Hospitals and not to speak of special Homoeopathic Hospitals and not to\\n      speak of special Homoeopathic Hospitals the result is Homoeopathy is not\\n      getting a fair chance of treating those diseases like tuberculosis,\\n      cancer, acute infectious diseases of epidemic type e.g., Small-pox,\\n      Cholera etc. on a large and organised scale. Consequently the general\\n      public cannot keep much faith in this treatment and mostly take recourse\\n      to homoeopathic treatment when the case is \"past all hope and past\\n      all surgery\". Hence the establishment of fully - equipped\\n      Homoeopathic institutions (College - cum - Hospitals) is an imperative\\n      necessity for enhancing the prestige of the Homoeopathic profession and\\n      for convincing the people about the therapeutic efficacy of this system of\\n      treatment. Is it not a pity that Homoeopathy once established its\\n      reputation by treating Cholera cases in this city and now nobody thinks of\\n      this treatment in Cholera cases and rushes the patient to the Allopathic\\n      Hospitals which are especially meant for these types of patients? How can\\n      we hope to gain ground under these circumstances?\\n      \\n The next great obstacle is the apathy\\n      and in many cases active antagonism of our Government, both at the Centre\\n      and at least in some of the State, towards Homoeopathy. The Government is\\n      under the thumb of its medical directorates which are solely manned by\\n      Allopathic doctors. The main reasons for the non - acceptance of the\\n      Homoeopathic system of treatment may be summed up in three words:\\n      tradition, authority and professionalism. Their psychology is easily\\n      understood if it is borne in mind that the conservative inertia of human\\n      mind attempts to reject any new thought will all the means at its\\n      disposal. Another reason is due to vested interests. Even a cursory glance\\n      at the history of origin and spread of Homoeopathy, enables one to find\\n      out that the opposition to this system from the start, was not scientific\\n      but rather of commercial nature on the part of the apothecaries who were\\n      afraid of losing their trade - profits. We regret to note that the Central\\n      Government have not yet implemented a single recommendation put forward by\\n      the Homoeopathic Enquiry Committee, Planning Commission. Third Health\\n      Ministers Conference, Ad Hoc Committee etc. though Homoeopathic Acts have\\n      been passed in the States of Bombay, U.P., Madhya Pradesh, Travancore -\\n      Cochin, Bihar etc. I is curious to note that W. Bengal is the only State\\n      where a Homoeopathic Bill has recently been thrown out by the State\\n      Government.\\n      \\n Another great obstacle is the\\n      psychology of the general mass of population who fail to adopt a proper\\n      philosophical attitude towards Homoeopathy and takes the Homoeopathic\\n      Therapeutic Law as great paradox contrary to common sense. Unless we can\\n      educate the public in the matter, we cannot hope to secure their whole -\\n      hearted support for this system of treatment.\\n      \\n Lack of enthusiasm for constructive\\n      works on the part of the Homoeopathic profession, the apathy of our\\n      Government and hesitancy on the part of the public to accept Homoeopathy\\n      are great obstacles to the spread of this system of treatment in the\\n      country. Unless this vicious circles is broken the progress of Homoeopathy\\n      is bound to be impeded. We have to fight on all fronts if we aspire to\\n      achieve victory in our battle for the cause of Homoeopathy and the\\n      suffering humanity.\\n      \\n But our first necessity as pointed out\\n      by the Soul of India expressing itself through Sri Aurobindo, is: If India\\n      is to survive and do her appointed work in the world, the youth of India\\n      should learn to think, to think on all subjects, to think independently,\\n      fruitfully, going to the heart of things, not stopped by their surface,\\n      free of pre - judgements, shearing sophism and prejudice asunder as with a\\n      sharp sword smiting down obscurantism of all kinds as with a mace of\\n      Bhima.\\n      \\n \"Let our brains no longer, like\\n      European infants, be swathed with swaddling clothes; let it have recover\\n      the free and unbound motion of the Gods, let it have not only the\\n      minuteness but the wide mastery and sovereignty natural to the intellect\\n      of Bharata and easily recoverable by it if it once accustomes itself to\\n      feel its own power and be convinced of its own worth.\\n      \\n \"The old fixed foundations have\\n      been broken up, we are tossing in the waters of a great upheaval and\\n      change. It is no use clinging to the old ice - floes of the past, they\\n      will soon melt and leave their refugees struggling in perilous waters. It\\n      is no use landing ourselves in the infirm bog, neither sea nor good, dry\\n      land of a second - hand Europeanism. We shall only die there a miserable\\n      and unclean death.\\n      \\n \"No we must learn to swim and use\\n      that power to reach the good vessel of unchanging truth; we must land\\n      again on the eternal rock of ages.\"\\n      \\n Yes, we must expand, we must assimilate\\n      whatever is assimilable for our growth. Stagnation and contraction are the\\n      signs of Death. Our knowledge must be aggressive, must diffuse through the\\n      rank and file of the whole Homoeopathic profession if we wish to survive\\n      and perpetuate ourselves; to leave an extensive ignorance either below or\\n      around us is to expose ourselves to the perpetual danger of being\\n      exterminated as a professional entity.\\n      \\n In fine, I welcome you, once again, on\\n      this historic occasion to this historic city to deliberate, to exchange\\n      view points and to come to agreed decisions with regard to our future line\\n      of action in respect of Homoeopathy in all its aspects.'\n",
      " 'Tresorie - SOME OBSERVATIONS ON NEURASTHENIA AND ITS TREATMENT\\n[Neurasthenia & Treatment]\\n\\n WHEN, thirty-five years ago, the writer\\n      first made the acquaintance of what is now called neurasthenia, it was\\n      known as spinal irritation, and the best of modern researches have been\\n      unable to give a better definition beyond a functional disturbance of the\\n      spinal and cerebral nerves, dependent on a morbid process, for which\\n      \"irritation\" is as proper a term as any. As deaths do not occur,\\n      autopsies throw no light on the subject. Briefly stated, neurasthenia,\\n      when observed from the beginning through its chronic course, has a period\\n      of prodromal symptoms followed by a protracted acute, and succeeded by a\\n      still more protracted chronic, state, between the end of which and the\\n      beginning of convalescence there is a very vague, often indiscernible,\\n      boundary line.\\n      \\n The prodromal symptoms are quite\\n      indefinite and very variable, pointing to nothing in particular. Loss of\\n      appetite, irregular sleep, excitability alternating with lassitude, etc.,\\n      are often overlooked, especially when the second stage-display of unusual\\n      mental and physical energy without subsequent fatigue- becomes apparent.\\n      This is often mistaken for a sign of unusually good health. When a young\\n      girl or mature woman, married or unmarried, feels that she can study ten\\n      hours a day and devote half of her night to pleasure or business; when\\n      besides much mental occupation she begins to rejoice in long walks without\\n      fatigue, that is the time when the mischief is going on without exciting\\n      timely suspicion. Relief is at last sought when the functional disorder of\\n      the nerves has gone to the opposite extreme, and becomes manifest in what\\n      is properly and popularly termed \"nervous prostration,\" when\\n      instead of having no sense of fatigue, the best bodily or mental effort\\n      seems intolerable, in grave cases rendering the patient a helpless being,\\n      completely dependent on the unremitting assistance of others whom she )it\\n      is usually a woman) rules with the inexorable power of the vis inertiae.\\n      \\n During this usually very protracted\\n      period of the disease convalescence usually sets in, but so imperceptibly\\n      that the physician alone can sometimes estimate its progress, which is\\n      unnoticeable to others towards whom the patient acts as she has for months\\n      or years. This is the time for action, too often delayed from motives of\\n      misplaced sympathy on the part of relatives and friends.\\n      \\n The affections is in many instances\\n      limited to the spine, the mind becoming only secondarily tired. In other\\n      cases it is spinal and cerebral; in others again chiefly cerebral. The\\n      line between this and insanity is always clearly definable. Though a\\n      neurasthenic patient may become insane, and probably the reverse, yet both\\n      are distinct conditions.\\n      \\n Books speak of this disease at common\\n      to men and women. Yet in this region in small towns as well as in large\\n      cities the cases of neurasthenia in women are preponderatingly great.\\n      \\n Hypochondriacs and hysteria stand in\\n      peculiar relation to neurasthenia. They maybe regarded as different\\n      species of the same genus; that is, more or less deeply seated\\n      disturbances of the cerebro-spinal system in which the sympathetic system\\n      is probably indirectly involved, as many functional disturbances presided\\n      over by the great sympathetic system often testify. Hypochondriasis, pure\\n      and simple as occurring in men, is easily distinguishable by its striking\\n      characteristic of introspection and despondency, occasioned by abnormal\\n      sensations, without marked physical weakness and tiredness. Pure\\n      hypochondriacs are often energetic, conscientious workers. In hysteria\\n      there is neither great tiredness nor tendency to introspection, but a\\n      paroxysmal or prolonged absence of the power of self control, in grave\\n      cases associated with tonic or clonic muscular spasm and loss of\\n      consciousness. While neurasthenia in its uncomplicated forms is free from\\n      these symptoms, but, as ample experience teaches, often complicated with\\n      both of the preceding forms to such an extent that it is often very\\n      difficult to tell which is primary and which secondary. The symptoms known\\n      as introspection, hysterical aberrations of the emotions, and neurasthenic\\n      sense of exhaustion are in their distinctive manifestations most important\\n      and constitute indications in the selection of remedial and dietetic\\n      measures.\\n      \\n The following are some observation of\\n      peculiarities observed in a large number of cases and peculiar to all:.\\n      \\n Introspection.-The neurasthenic patient\\n      in variably expresses her desire for relief, not so much in a direct\\n      appeal as in a supplicating, subdued tone of voice and manner. She rarely\\n      asks, \"What can you do to relieve me?\" but almost invariably,\\n      \"What is the cause of\" this or that sensation? If she is\\n      introspective, that is, hypochondriacal, she becomes a nosomaniac,\\n      watching acutely every one of her numerous distressing sensation, on the\\n      unremitting analysis of which her mind dwells. In marked cases she is\\n      quite unable to think of anything outside of herself, and in many cases\\n      dislikes to do so, preferring to river her attention on herself. Attempts\\n      to divert her annoy or anger her. Friends and relatives implore the\\n      physician to divert the patient, but all their attempts are in vain\\n      because quite misdirected.\\n      \\n Positive and Negative Will.-It seems\\n      sometimes as if the patient delights in her self-inspection, and that she\\n      prefers her condition to speedy recovery. This is not the case, for the\\n      patient will always assure the physician of her wish to get well. During\\n      the acute stage-a long yet definable period-this wish and longing cannot\\n      well be utilized, but the long and ill-defined period of convalescence\\n      must first be awaited. Here we shall always discover that the wish and the\\n      will of the patient are two very different mental conditions. The desire\\n      or wish for recovery is entirely unattended by any will effort to\\n      accomplish the desired end. The injunctions and directions of the\\n      physician are resisted by the same unconquerable power of negative power,\\n      or vis inertiae. The patient having been unable to exert her will, now\\n      thinks herself unable to use it.\\n      \\n Numerous Symptoms of Patients.-To\\n      physicians in search of indications for medicines each statement of\\n      patient concerning a sensation is apt to be considered as a symptom. Many\\n      years ago, when resolved to get at the keynote of a patient\\'s case, the\\n      writer determined to allow the patient to detail all her symptoms as long\\n      as she chose and to take accurate notes of each one till the right one\\n      should be disclosed; and this was to be done regardless of time and\\n      exertion. The patient, one who needed no urging to describe her\\n      \"symptoms,\" began in an almost inaudible voice, detailing one\\n      sensation after another with an unrivalled degree of clearness and\\n      vividness of expression; as she proceeded the voice became stronger, her\\n      face slightly flushed, and the most perfect descriptive language flowed in\\n      an endless stream. Each word was written down, page after page was filled;\\n      still she went on with unmistakable signs of satisfaction at being able to\\n      pour her pent-up emotions into willing and sympathetic ears. If, for a\\n      moment, the flow of language was interrupted, a simple question would\\n      re-animate her to proceed with renewed energy. Feelings seemed to beget\\n      feelings; their complexity gave the patient no trouble; her intellect was\\n      equal to the action of unraveling the most complicated sensation,\\n      separating them into their component parts and spreading them out before\\n      the mind of the listener. A glance at the watch showed that nearly two\\n      hours had passed, during which the feeblest of neurasthenic patients had\\n      talked incessantly. The note-book was full, the keynote was found. It was\\n      this: neurasthenic patients have innumerable sensation and exhibit no\\n      sings of fatigue after talking incessantly for nearly two hours.\\n      \\n Great Endurance of Neurasthenics.-The\\n      instance just related, which is one of many, illustrates two things. One\\n      is, that it is not the kind of sensation described but the fact that\\n      neurasthenics have innumerable sensations, that constitute the symptoms.\\n      The other thing is that many neurasthenics are capable of great exertion\\n      without suffering disagreeable after- effects from fatigue. This is\\n      illustrated by other cases of which I have notes. A highly neurasthenic\\n      young lady consented to camp out for her health near a lake. She was\\n      induced to join a party for a short walk along the lake. By trying what\\n      they thought a shorter road the party lost their way and took a very long\\n      walk of about four hours, through bogs and over forces. The neurasthenic\\n      was less fatigued than some of the others. The interesting observation was\\n      subsequently made that the patient had become interested in a young man of\\n      the party. She recovered her health within a year from that time. Other\\n      cases of this kind will appear under the head of therapeutic suggestions.\\n      \\n Neurasthenic Patients Crave\\n      Sympathy.-This is one of the most formidable obstacles to the curative\\n      management of such cases, for the kind of sympathy such patients crave is\\n      expressions of condolence and more or less deep affliction at so much\\n      suffering as the patient expresses. Such sympathy is most natural and does\\n      honor to the feelings of parents, sisters, brothers and husbands, but it\\n      is unfortunate that the deeper their expression of affliction so much the\\n      more profound will be the mental dejection and weakness of the patient.\\n      Almost every case which has come under the writer\\'s observation has been\\n      much hampered if not made hopeless by this condition of things, against\\n      which no remedy suggests itself that would not be construed as\\n      \"unkind\".\\n      \\n The origin of this very formidable and\\n      refractory nervous disease, like that of most diseases usually termed\\n      chronic, is either hereditary or acquired, as the histories of every\\n      observed case plainly testify. Either the father was a hypochondriac or\\n      the mother neurasthenic, or both parents were of unsound nervous\\n      constitution. Dipsomania on the part of parents produces neurasthenia in\\n      the children, as readily as it will be followed by any other form of\\n      nervous disease, according to the individual predisposition of the\\n      offspring. The excessive use of tea and coffee is another very active\\n      factor in the history of neurasthenics. Where fathers inclined to alcohol,\\n      mothers are addicted to tea and coffee, which, while its immediate effects\\n      do not obtrude themselves upon our notice, are none the less insidious in\\n      their more remote consequences.\\n      \\n The acquired forms of neurasthenia are\\n      of utmost interest to the therapeutist, and the sources of acquisition are\\n      readily stated. They are much brain-work with insufficient food and sleep.\\n      Such conditions obtain chiefly in women (less frequently in men) of fine\\n      intellectual ability, conscientiousness and ambition. Physical overwork\\n      with unintellectual women has no such effect. Quite analogous to the above\\n      are the conditions of care and sorrow, especially in women who are able\\n      for a long time to conceal and control their emotions. The usual\\n      consequence of such states of mind is disregard of food and insufficient\\n      sleep. Instances of acquired neurasthenia are presented in families of\\n      several girls and boys, where one or more of the former are Neurasthenic\\n      while the latter are vigorous and athletic. Boys delighting in vigorous\\n      exercise do not, as is the case with girls, lose appetite and sleep.\\n      \\n The effects of nervous exhaustion in\\n      boys are usually much less grave than in girls; as a rule such effects are\\n      manifested in mental, not muscular, tiredness, and they are relieved by\\n      air and exercise, while in girls and women those influences are shunned\\n      because they seem to increase the tiredness.\\n      \\n Predisposition-The temperament, or what\\n      in modern pharaseology is called the personal equation, plays a visible\\n      but uncontrollable part in the progress of neurasthenia, as temperament\\n      greatly determines the other imperfectly known condition known as\\n      predisposition. Where the disease is hereditary, it is easy to say that\\n      the predisposition is due to that source; where there is no history of\\n      heredity and where neurasthenia exists in the last members of a\\n      generation, it may be attributed to acquired predisposition which needed\\n      only the exciting cause to establish the disease in its most typical form.\\n      \\n One of the most common forms of\\n      neurasthenia, often quite intractable, results from a serious defect in\\n      our public school system, one which affects chiefly girls from twelve to\\n      fourteen years of age. The following is a brief example: The child rises\\n      late with no appetite for breakfast and no time to eat it if so inclined.\\n      The lessons, however, have been learned the evening before, and the school\\n      work is begun with an ambitions will and a crammed mind, and continues\\n      with one intermission of often not more than ten minutes or three of four\\n      hours. The pupil arrives at home ravenously hungry, eats too fast, and too\\n      much of injudiciously prepared food, too long in digesting to leave room\\n      for an appetite for even a light evening meal, or even for a breakfast the\\n      next morning.\\n      \\n In another case the girl or boy grows\\n      desperately hungry while at school, but being unprovided with food\\n      (lunch), goes on with the school exercises, at the end of which the sense\\n      of hunger has vanished and has been replaced by an aversion to normal\\n      food, with a possible craving for something pungent and indigestible. This\\n      observation can easily be made in many instances, and will, in as many\\n      cases, be seen to lead to nervous prostration, which is then treated by\\n      vile, patented concoctions consisting largely of whiskey, under the name\\n      of \"tonics,\" while the patient needs only the best that a\\n      legitimate market affords prepared in a sensible manner.\\n      \\n Typical Cases Ending in Rapid\\n      Recovery.-Curative results have already been indicated in what has been\\n      said above, and further indications for treatment may be gathered from a\\n      few cases of extremely rapid recovery of apparently incurable cases, to\\n      which brief allusion will here be made. A woman of forty had been a victim\\n      of grave neurasthenia for five years. In the absence of an inclination to\\n      exert himself, she had, during that period, been mostly confined to her\\n      bed or lounge, in the meantime giving birth to two children, going through\\n      gestation and confinement normally, without recovering from neurasthenic\\n      prostration which, in the course of some years more, rendered her entirely\\n      helpless. Her condition was associated with a feeling of dropping to\\n      pieces unless supported and braced by a harness of wood, iron and leather,\\n      in which she \"sat up\" for several hours each day, spending the\\n      rest of the time in bed. Having left the patient in this condition, it was\\n      reported before the writer\\'s next professional visit that Mrs.-had been\\n      cured, and that she was able to go out like other people. A visit to the\\n      house confirmed the report. The patient came to the door herself, and in a\\n      quiet manner, entirely without the least expression of joy or wonder at\\n      her release, stated, that having heard of a famous \"magnetic\\n      physician,\" she summoned him, was ordered by him to arise and stand;\\n      protesting that it was impossible, she was raised to her feet and again\\n      ordered to stand, then to walk. Fearing that she would fall, she begged\\n      the magnetic doctor to support her, which he peremptorily refused, saying\\n      she might fall if she liked. Instead of falling, she had to walk about the\\n      room, was then placed upon a lounge and subjected to a severe treatment of\\n      rolling and pummelling, and then ordered to dress and sit up until tired,\\n      to remain up and about like other people, and to call on the doctor in\\n      future, as he would not come so far to the patient again. This happened\\n      about twenty-five years ago, and the patient has been in very fair health\\n      arrested by insisting that all professional visits by the writer or any\\n      other physician to whose sympathy the patient could appeal must cease.\\n      This injunction was carried out conscientiously with the best results by\\n      the husband of the patient. Perhaps we may learn from this that sometimes,\\n      at least, the familiar motto is reversed, and angels rush in where fools\\n      fear to tread.\\n      \\n Profiting by this experience, another\\n      neurasthenic woman, unmarried, but of most intractable, antagonistic\\n      temperament, confined to her bed, in and out of hospitals, for years,\\n      wearing out the strength and means of her relatives and the patience of\\n      many physicians, was at length abandoned by them. It was a case of spinal\\n      and cerebral neurasthenia complicated with hypochondriasis in its most\\n      trying form of introspective maunderings and endless description of\\n      symptoms. She tormented her advisers by her endless tirades, the\\n      indulgence of which invariably aggravated her condition, and were there\\n      fore avoided, until once her physician yielded to the patient\\'s\\n      importunities for a visit, when be found her in her usual abject state of\\n      prostration. Guided by experience derived from cases like the one first\\n      described, he assisted the patient to her feet and marched her, will you\\n      nil you, up and down the room until he, at least, was thoroughly tired,\\n      and then departed with the promise never to do so again. The patient, on\\n      her part, made a number of her unnameable promises, but kept on her feet\\n      and let the doctors alone. Though not cured of deeply-rooted morbid mental\\n      faults, the neurasthenic phase of her condition had yielded to the change\\n      of the antagonistic element of her character from passive to very\\n      practical activity. A third very serious case of this kind occurred in the\\n      person of a girl of fifteen, of selfish character, who gradually became\\n      bed-ridden with spinal and cerebral neurasthenia, and tormented with the\\n      usual multifarious painful sensations, none of which, on the most\\n      pains-taking physical examination, resulted from demonstrable organic\\n      disease of genital or abdominal organs. The patient was most tenderly\\n      cared for by her mother, who, in the course of years, became so imbued\\n      with the idea of yielding to every wish and whim of the patient, that at\\n      length remonstrance became useless. The mother, though recognizing the\\n      importance of persuading or urging her daughter to depend more on herself,\\n      admitted that she had yielded so long that now she must continue to feed,\\n      dress and assist her charge in the most trivial things. Her food had to be\\n      placed in her mouth, the position of a hand or foot changed by some one\\n      else, although patient did so spontaneously when she chose. This went on\\n      for fifteen years, when the mother, growing old and feeble, died. Her\\n      maternal support being gone, the patient at once proved her ability to\\n      walk, to dress, to feed herself, and to seek light employment. Though far\\n      from well, she is equally far fro being a helpless, bed-ridden invalid.\\n      \\n A fourth case, still very vividly\\n      impressed on the writer\\'s mind, was one of a healthy, romping girl of 14,\\n      who, as happen in this remarkably capricious disease, in the midst of\\n      perfect health, one day took to her bed and remained there with all the\\n      symptoms of neurasthenia, involving first the spinal and finally the\\n      cerebral nerves. This patient was very amiable, conscientious, and\\n      sensible, never loquacious, and not troubled with hypochondriacal thoughts\\n      or sensations. Tiredness was the only expression she used in describing\\n      her feelings. There was literally no variation from this condition, which\\n      confined her to her bed for years, till she grew from a girl to a woman.\\n      Eating and sleeping well, and improving perceptibly in personal appearance\\n      and character, yet she lay on her couch tired and watched over with\\n      unremitting care by a most anxious mother, showing her solicitude and\\n      sympathy in every feature. Once, in the second year of the disease, a\\n      favorable interruption occurred. The mother, still a young woman, gave\\n      birth to another child. During her confinement the neurasthenic patient\\n      was in charge of her mother\\'s nurse, assisted by other servants. The\\n      nurse, while devoted to the daughter, agreed with the writer that excess\\n      of sympathy was injurious, and used her best and judicious endeavors\\n      gradually to persuade the patient to make some physical effort at walking\\n      and standing. In this she was so successful that in two weeks she\\n      accompanied the girl on half-mile walks up and down hill, finally without\\n      assistance. Thus, recovery seemed assured, and everything was favorable\\n      progressing towards it when the mother, having fully recovered, again took\\n      charge of her daughter, with the result that she at once took to her\\n      lounge and remained there two years longer. About that time other advice\\n      was urged and gladly acceded to, with the result that the case was\\n      diagnosed by an eminent surgeon as spinal paralysis in consequence of\\n      concussion, though it could never be shown when and where it occurred.\\n      Salves, plasters, anodynes, nervines, and electricity did no good, but\\n      effectually destroyed appetite and digestion, which higher to had been\\n      normal. So this adviser resigned in favor of a third, who, being a younger\\n      and less prejudiced man, agreed perfectly with the writer\\'s original\\n      opinion. He advised return to moderate exercise, avoidance of drugs, and\\n      less display of sympathy. This, though formerly rejected as\\n      \"unkind,\" was now acceded to as coming from a nerve- specialist,\\n      fresh from Europe, at that time very rare. Still attending the other\\n      members of the family, the writer had sample opportunity of observing the\\n      course of the case. Improvement was very slow and uncertain till financial\\n      misfortune overtook the family. Almost with a bound our patient left her\\n      cough, and, organizing a kindergarten, strove energetically in supporting\\n      herself and assisting her mother. The change came about in less than three\\n      weeks, and resulted in perfect recovery.\\n      \\n At this point another very instructive\\n      case of very speedy recovery, after six or seven years of neurasthenic\\n      prostration, deserves to be mentioned. A woman of 35 had been in bed and\\n      on the lounge most of the time for nearly seven years, at the end of which\\n      time she became my patient, her regular medical attendant having gone to\\n      Europe. She was of very amiable disposition and as sensitive as she was\\n      weak. Her symptoms, as in the other cases, were instantaneous exhaustion\\n      on the least physical exertion. She could give herself up to no mental\\n      occupation beyond directing her house-hold affairs, the education of her\\n      son, and the rehearsal of her numerous sensations. She had not been my\\n      patient long when her husband failed in business, so that the family was\\n      reduced from very comfortable circumstances to a condition which made it\\n      necessary for the patient to make her own living and that of the family.\\n      This she almost at once proceeded to do, setting aside all other\\n      considerations and establishing a boarding-house, where she did most of\\n      the work herself. This she has done now for ten or twelve years without a\\n      serious relapse. The time involved in the period of convalescence was\\n      scarcely more than three weeks, a although her work maybe said to have\\n      begun at the moment her resolution was taken.\\n      \\n Prognostics.-From these and other cases\\n      in and outside of the writer\\'s practice, it is safe to say that the\\n      majority of cases of neurasthenia recover, though years may elapse before\\n      that period. We learn, furthermore, that recoveries, especially of very\\n      inveterate cases, depend on conditions beyond the control of the\\n      physician, as was the case in the above-recorded instances, where\\n      circumstances forced the patient to cases to wish for recovery and to make\\n      an effort of the will. This having been once accomplished self-confidence,\\n      for a long time in abeyance, was permanently restored.\\n      \\n Curability, further, depends very much\\n      on the temperament of the patient, whether amiable, tractable and\\n      confiding in the honest endeavors of the physician, or whether refractory,\\n      suspicious, untruthful, selfish and antagonistic, of a disposition\\n      impossible to win over on account of unnatural distrust of every\\n      well-meaning person. The degree of intelligence of patients also has a\\n      pronounced influence on the result. The most readily curable cases are\\n      those acquired without hereditary predisposition, where the cause is found\\n      in the absence of food and sleep, also where sorrow and anxiety can be\\n      averted or counteracted by judicious conduct of near relatives and\\n      friends.\\n      \\n Dietetic Treatment.-This, as medicinal\\n      treatment, must be governed by the stage at which the case comes into the\\n      physician\\'s hands-whether yet in its prodromal, its acute or its chronic\\n      phase. The prodromal stage of the disease has no very decided\\n      pathognomonic signs. The most that can be recognized in this stage is that\\n      the patient\\'s habits or duties are of a kind which will eventually lead to\\n      obdurate neurasthenia if not arrested in time by removing the exciting\\n      causes. Too much pleasure, as well as too much care, especially in girls\\n      and woman, tends to neglect of food and rest, in the absence of which,\\n      excitements, whether of pleasure or care, begets a state of unrest in\\n      which repose is disagreeable. With such a condition comes a list of\\n      incipient casual complaints of headache, imperfect sleep, notional ways of\\n      eating, working or playing. A few questions will determine whether the\\n      patient is living according to normal or abnormal habits with regard to\\n      appetite, sleep and occupation. Where these are found, their alteration to\\n      normal ways must be instead on. It is unnecessary to say that this is\\n      easier said than done, for it will probably meet with serious objections\\n      on the part of the patient, if not on that of her relatives; for most\\n      likely she has examinations for college to prepare for, involving several\\n      months of dose and careful study at night, and the patient cannot waste\\n      time in sleeping and eating while cramming that little excited and\\n      ambitions brain. A failure in the examinations would be as much of a\\n      disappointment to parents as to patient, who proves, as usual, that this\\n      appellation is a misnomer. She accordingly goes in as she please, lied by\\n      an increasing morbidly ambitions impulse, and the result is likely to be\\n      the mournful satisfaction on the part of the physician of being obliged to\\n      say, \"I told you before what would happen.\" Of course, all\\n      regret the now evident nerve-prostration, while, if the doctor had\\n      succeeded in enforcing his rules, he would in many cases experience the\\n      still more painful reproach of having been too severe. Nevertheless,\\n      absolute firmness and a kindly but unflinching exertion of his will,\\n      without the least compromise, reward the physician with the best results\\n      in such cases.\\n      \\n When the case, after the stage of\\n      excitement and untiring restlessness (at which it would still be speedily\\n      curable by simple dietetic rules) has, after weeks or months, entered upon\\n      the phase of painful prostration, here we encounter backache, oppressive\\n      headache, and absolute loss of mental or bodily endurance, measures of\\n      dietetic management are much less effective and much more difficult to\\n      find. it is at this stage that slight rise of temperature will occur,\\n      especially towards evening; then the backache and headache disappear, the\\n      pallor is replaced by a flush of color, the eyes lose their listless look,\\n      and the patient is inclined to enter upon some diversion or excitement,\\n      followed by a restless night and a morning of exhaustion and a renewal of\\n      all painful sensations. Most of such patients feel much better in the\\n      evening when they are ready for some entertainment, while in a normal\\n      state this would be the time for relaxation and repose.\\n      \\n The dietetic treatment of this stage is\\n      methodical rest. In severe cases the patient will do well to remain in bed\\n      for several days or even for weeks. It is well to shorten this period as\\n      much as possible and to insist on walking about, or, at least. sitting for\\n      a specified time every day. This may be varied b equally specified periods\\n      of rest in the recumbent position.\\n      \\n Irregularities of eating are at this\\n      and at all times to be superseded by the most rigid regularity of meals.\\n      The traditional and conventional three-meal system, however well adapted\\n      to the needs of a vigorous man or woman, does not agree with the\\n      neurasthenic patient. It is much better that these should eat oftener;\\n      four times a day is best in most cases, for the simple reason that in this\\n      way a patient, while eating less at a time, consumes more food in the\\n      aggregate.\\n      \\n As neurasthenic patients are rarely\\n      troubled with absolute aversion to wholesome food, they are generally able\\n      to consume a liberal quantity, about which it is only needful to remark\\n      here that the food should be selected from among the articles and dishes\\n      which the patient likes, provided they belong to the order of good, normal\\n      articles of food, to the exclusion of those which simply please the taste\\n      without being digestible. A dish entirely of meat or \"animal\\n      food\" is as far from being a good diet for neurasthenics as one\\n      consisting entirely of \"vegetable\" food. As a rule, the diet\\n      list should comprise one-third of nitrogenous material and two-thirds of\\n      carbohydrates. Together with these, it is a great mistake to neglect the\\n      fats, such as good butter and the fats of meats. And, lastly, every\\n      patient of this kind should be made to drink some water often, a dietetic\\n      feature too often neglected.\\n      \\n During this stage, actually fatiguing\\n      exercise of body and mind should be avoided, while, on the other hand, the\\n      patient\\'s mind should be directed away from herself, in which she is much\\n      assisted by withholding a certain kind of emotional sympathy, quite as\\n      natural as it is difficult to repress on the part of affectionate persons.\\n      Of this, a few words further on.\\n      \\n There is no definite time for the\\n      duration of this stage, which, however, depends largely on the time during\\n      which the exciting causes have acted, either aided by or without a\\n      predisposition. It is certain, however, that the sooner it is recognized\\n      and the exciting causes eliminated, so much the sooner recovery will\\n      begin. But there is a stage at which the best of experience and judgment\\n      often fail, especially in very inveterate cases. If the case is one of a\\n      patient whom the physician has had opportunity of watching at least since\\n      the earlier stages, the difficulty is not so great as it is in old cases\\n      months or even of several years\\' duration which come to treatment late. In\\n      these, the line between the intermediate stage and incipient convalescence\\n      cannot be drawn. The patient is as neurasthenic and hypochondriacal as\\n      ever; cannot bear the slightest mental or bodily exertion, not even a word\\n      or a look, without sings of apparent exhaustion, while nearly the whole\\n      time is spent in bed under anxious care of sympathetic attendants. In such\\n      cases, having become assured, by careful physical examination, of the\\n      absence of organic disease, seeing the patient generally well nourished\\n      and in fair muscular condition, the physician is warranted in assuming\\n      that the disease has run its course, that whatever morbid (pathological)\\n      process there may have been progressing in the nervous system, this\\n      process has now come to and end, but it has left the patient\\'s mental\\n      condition habituated to the moods of the past months or years, and fixed,\\n      as it were, indelibly in the memory. It is the habit that now remains, not\\n      the disease.\\n      \\n If reasonably sure of this, and calling\\n      to mind the rapid recoveries and the circumstances attending them, as\\n      above detailed, the physician is now safe in ordering a more energetic\\n      treatment, calculated to rouse the self-reliance of the patient. All\\n      visible signs of sympathy must now be set aside; the actins and demeanor\\n      of the attendants should, from this time, if not before, be changed so as\\n      to give the patient the impression that she is no longer an invalid, but\\n      expected to rely on her own exertion. Instead of being fed, the food\\n      should be placed where she must go for and eat it. She should now be\\n      expected to dress and attend, without assistance, to her natural wants.\\n      This, with some temperaments, is almost impossible, with al extremely\\n      difficult. The best course to pursue is to remove such patients from\\n      sympathetic relatives or friends, and to place them in charge of kind,\\n      reliable, but eminently practical nurses.\\n      \\n The first effect of this is either to\\n      throw the patient into a stage of helpless despondency, which, again\\n      appealing powerfully to the sympathies of those nearest to her, often\\n      frustrates the physician\\'s plans which, if firmly but kindly adhered to,\\n      would, ere long, prove of their superiority by signs of returning\\n      self-reliance and absence of complaints on the part of the patient. A\\n      second form of effect is that occurring in patients of obstreperous,\\n      selfish disposition, whose opposition and even anger is aroused by being\\n      thrown on their own resources after the removal of depressing and\\n      unpractical sympathy. This opposition or temper, often manifested in all\\n      sorts of intrigues and subterfuges on the part of the patient, if not\\n      supinely yielded to by sympathetic persons, will finally be replaced by a\\n      more rational disposition. On the whole, anger or active opposition are\\n      signs of returning energy, which, once coming to the consciousness of the\\n      patient, takes the form of self- reliance. it is this way that the cures\\n      of chronic cases above related can be explained, and physicians should\\n      profit by such experience for the benefit of their patients.\\n      \\n The general dietetic management now\\n      readily follows from what has been said, and needs only a few general\\n      modifications. The first duty of the physician will be to test the degree\\n      of reliance to be placed on the patient and her friends, ad to win them\\n      over if possible to his plans, and his success will be in proportion to\\n      the degree of confidence he is able to inspire. This personal confidence\\n      should not degenerate into a mere personal liking or attachment of a\\n      sympathy-craving neurasthenic who should discover henceforth that all\\n      sentimental expressing of sympathy are about to take a practical form,\\n      aiming at a definite result-the patient\\'s health-which she wishes but\\n      cannot exert her will to attain. The best and often the only way to do\\n      away with sentiment and to reach practical kindness is to remove the\\n      patient from certain home influence, and to place her in a hospital or\\n      elsewhere under the management of competent nurses who, without being\\n      selfish, know how to exert a certain amount of wholesome push as fast as\\n      the patient can bear it. Without the removal of sentimental sympathy, all\\n      efforts at counteracting the purely hypochondriacal side of neurasthenia\\n      are useless.\\n      \\n In these cases of neurasthenia as yet\\n      uncomplicated with the hypochondriacal element of introspective nosomania,\\n      there is only one unconditional rule to be followed, especially in\\n      acquired cases whose evident cause was incessant, conscientious work of\\n      mind and body, together with insufficient food and sleep. Such cases come\\n      on very insidiously, the loss of strength-that is, the actual waste of\\n      nerve-substance-being just a trifle grater than the quantity restored, the\\n      patient unconsciously using up a minute part of her capital every day.\\n      Here the rule should be to reverse matters to insuring a supply of\\n      nourishment and time for its assimilation greater than was the case\\n      heretofore. The case of young school-girls belong in this class. The time\\n      of food and rest should be carefully controlled at home, the duty of the\\n      physician being to educate indifferent and ignorant parents up to an\\n      appreciation of the nature of the case. It is generally not difficult to\\n      open their eyes through the medium of their anxiety concerning their\\n      children\\'s health. Having thus insured sufficient rest and food at home,\\n      the physician\\'s next object of attention should be the regulations of the\\n      school. Here is the point where teachers have an opportunity of exerting\\n      their most practical influence. It should be made obligatory on the part\\n      of teachers to institute inquiry as to whether pupils have had their meals\\n      before coming to school. This they could often ascertain without a\\n      question, by reading the pupil\\'s condition in her emaciated form, pale\\n      face and nervous manner. To guard against neglect at home, it would be an\\n      easy matter to insist that all pupils of public and private schools should\\n      bring with them some proper food. The few who do so generally bring\\n      sweets-an apple, orange or a few dry crackers-when a piece of good bread\\n      and slice of cold meat would be what they actually need. All pupils should\\n      pass inspection, and if remiss in this important particular, the\\n      delinquent should be dismissed with several marks against her. To expect\\n      this of teachers would be a great advance in the place of futile\\n      innovations of endeavoring to send forth from our common schools graduates\\n      in arts and sciences.\\n      \\n Sudden Effects.-A large number of cases\\n      of neurasthenia, especially those complicated with inveterate\\n      Hypochondriasis, are frequently traced to some sudden occurrence, having\\n      the effect of a mental or physical shock. In one patient, a vigorous girl,\\n      used to romping, climbing and running lie a boy, the cause was supposed to\\n      be a slight thump she received during a game of blindman\\'s-buff. She\\n      thought nothing of it at the time, but it was suggested long after the\\n      patient\\'s illness began. In another case some mental shock of joy or\\n      grief, not very severe and such as is often experienced in every person\\'s\\n      life, is the beginning of months of nervous prostration.\\n      \\n There is quite an array of evidence\\n      that neurasthenia which has entered upon a hypochondriacal stage or\\n      complication with or without a strong hysterical admixture, is curable by\\n      sudden impressions in the form of a shock, or more gradually by frequent\\n      repetitions of an impression. Such cases, as I have shown above, occur\\n      most commonly in the stage when what may be considered the essential\\n      pathological disturbances of function have run their course and have left\\n      the patient in a state of mental disturbance which indicated that the\\n      patient\\'s recovery depends entirely upon her volition. But there is none,\\n      and so far nothing has succeeded in arousing it. Persuasion is as useless\\n      and irritating, as argument would be in a case of insanity with a fixed\\n      illusion. The resemblance between this and the state of mind of a\\n      hypochondriacal neurasthenic is very close. She cannot move nor thick.\\n      Exhaustion overcomes her and keeps her its victim for years, when suddenly\\n      the scene changes, and a few days or weeks suffice to restore the patient\\n      to activity. In one instance it is attributed to medical, in another to\\n      \"mind cure,\" in a third to \"Christian science;\" in\\n      still other cases massage has done it, in others again \"magnetic\\n      influence,\" in others the very powerful factor necessity. It is\\n      certain that cases of this kind, produced by sudden effects on the mind of\\n      a predisposed person, are also cured by such effects. Whatever the visible\\n      form of these effects may be -whether that of \"Christian\\n      science,\" joy, grief or absolute inexorable necessity, there is\\n      always to be noticed a certain force and condition involving the modern\\n      idea of suggestion, which comes to the patient in an irresistible degree\\n      and now sets the function of the will in motion again.\\n      \\n Experience teaches that it is by no\\n      means a matter of indifference which of these forms of effect are brought\\n      into action. In one case it is the professional Christian scientist\\'s\\n      method, in another the almost brutal exertion of a person\\'s will combined\\n      with some physical force. In either case the patient is aroused from his\\n      inertia, and discovers his powers of mental and bodily ability to act.\\n      \\n A deplorable result is that recoveries\\n      after such effects are attributed in the popular mind to supernatural\\n      causes. That such is not the case may be gathered form instances occurring\\n      in very sensible and intelligent patients, whose reason is scarcely ever\\n      so far disturbed and weakened that they do not resent the proposition of\\n      trying, e.g., Christian science or mind cure.\\n      \\n Nevertheless, it is the mind cure which\\n      the intelligent patient needs quite as much as the ignorant and\\n      superstitious person; the difference is only the form in which the\\n      influencing force is applied. While in one case it is obedience to the\\n      candidly expressed instructions of the physician, in the other case the\\n      result is the to mystification. In either case it is the powerful stimulus\\n      of hope and aroused confidence that recovery will be realized.\\n      \\n The definition of suggestion does not\\n      fully cover the meaning, because the influence employed is greater than\\n      mere suggestion. The physician\\'s plan of action should be straightforward\\n      assurance of recovery, a direct appeal to hope, and an unceasing endeavor\\n      to arouse the self-reliance of the patient, not so much by verbal\\n      exhortations as by a manner and department from which the patient learns\\n      more readily than from words what is expected. If the attitude of the\\n      physician is appreciated, and seconded by the relatives and attendants, a\\n      favorable result is much more certain to follow.\\n      \\n Hypnotism is not advisable. There are\\n      now existing ancient neurasthenic invalids dating from the times of\\n      spiritualism when they were famous \"mediums.\" Hypnotism weakness\\n      the will and nervous endurance, and produces a predisposition to emotional\\n      nervousness with an intractable erotic admixture. The suggestions sought\\n      to be instilled into a hypnotized patient amount to nothing. The mental\\n      influence of mystical treatment administered while the patients is awake\\n      is much more powerful in awaking hope and confidence than the uncertain\\n      effects of an abnormal state like that of hypnotism. Mystification, again,\\n      though sometimes unavoidable with the best intention, is less powerful\\n      than direct and intelligible encouragement. While resort to mystification\\n      should be shunned by reputable physicians, the question arises as to what\\n      shall be done with the many who, from lack of intelligence or education,\\n      are entirely beyond the reach of honest common sense, and who will persist\\n      in mystifying themselves, who remain neurasthenic invalids in spite of the\\n      best regulations of the physician, and who do not recover unless their\\n      encouragement follows some mystical formalities which alone arouse their\\n      \"faith\" and finally their confidence and will-power. For the\\n      present there is no way out of the dilemma but to submit such patients to\\n      the suggestive methods of what is popularly known as mind cure and\\n      Christian science. In doing so, physicians should use their influence as\\n      far as possible in selecting the most honest persons of this class.\\n      \\n DISCUSSION.\\n      \\n JAMES C. WOOD, M.D.: I have nothing but\\n      words of praise for Dr. Wesselhoeft\\'s excellent paper. It is very evident\\n      that the author\\'s inspiration came not from books but from actual contact\\n      with neurasthenic subjects, for the impress of originality is most\\n      conspicuous. It is a production which could only come from one of\\n      experience and from a reasoner. I consider it a most valuable contribution\\n      to the literature of that now most interesting subject,\\n      \"neurasthenia\".\\n      \\n The doctor, in his paper, has sometimes\\n      used the term \"neurasthenia\" instead of\\n      \"neurasthenia.\" The first of these means, according to Thomas,\\n      great nervous power or excitement; the second, nervous debility. I taken\\n      it from the context that the subject dealt with is neurasthenia. To the\\n      average mind there exists what seems to me a needless confusion regarding\\n      the terms, nervous prostration, hysteria and hystero-neurosis. As I\\n      understand these terms they define distinct conditions, though there is a\\n      frequent blending the one with the other. The term nervous prostration,\\n      which is a synonym of neurasthenia, defines itself; the term hysteria\\n      should be restricted to those general neuroses characterized particularly\\n      by psychical manifestations, though not infrequently by motor, sensory,\\n      secretory, vasomotor and reflex derangements as well; while the term\\n      hysteroneurosis implies the uterine origin of symptoms manifesting\\n      themselves in organs remote from the uterus without structural changes in\\n      such organs, being the direct result of reflex nervous influence starting\\n      from the uterus. The last term does not occur in the paper under\\n      discussion. From the standpoint of a gynecologist I think that this is\\n      misleading.\\n      \\n Let us see why and how it is that these\\n      three conditions (I will not call them diseases) are so frequently\\n      associated. I think that all will admit the frequent occurrence in woman\\n      of reflex symptoms, the result of pelvic lesions. An irritation staring\\n      form the pelvis is conveyed to the genito-spinal centre, thence to any or\\n      all organs with which this centre communicates. The organ oftener involved\\n      than any other is the stomach. This is shown by the frequent occurrence of\\n      nausea and vomiting following conception. The nervous system may have been\\n      previously involved, but oftener it becomes so only after the nutrition is\\n      depraved, which, sooner or later, occurs if the pelvic lesion is not\\n      removed. The depraved blood fails to supply the nerve centres with that\\n      which they need to sustain them, and they become anaemic. Prostration is\\n      but a subjective manifestation of the anaemia, and it varies in degree\\n      from a slight indisposition to the most abject helplessness.\\n      \\n If, then, nervous prostration may have\\n      its beginning in a pelvic lesion, is it possible for a pelvic lesion to be\\n      inaugurated by systemic disturbances? Personally, I believe that it is,\\n      and offer this explanation as the modus operandi by which such a lesion is\\n      induced: Marked circulatory changes nearly always attend nervous\\n      prostration. The circulation is presided over by the vaso-motor system,\\n      and wear and repair depend upon the proper regulation of this system. If\\n      it becomes disturbed, the bloodvessels dilate or contract unduly, with\\n      resulting local hyperaemia or local anaemia, as the case maybe. The\\n      climacteric flushes are the result of such disturbance. The alternate\\n      coldness and heat of the extremities, so often associated with rectal and\\n      uterine lesions, is another familiar illustration. If the brain is\\n      involved, either insomnia or drowsiness occur, depending upon whether the\\n      brain is anaemic or hyperaemic. Flatulence, gastralgia, and nervous\\n      dyspepsia result when the stomach is similarly affected. The womb and the\\n      ovaries, because of the periodical congestion imposed upon them, are\\n      oftener implicated by these unnatural circulatory disturbances than any of\\n      the pelvic organs, and in time also become unduly hyperaemic or anaemic,\\n      as the case may be.\\n      \\n It will thus be seen that nervous\\n      prostration may exist independently of pelvic lesions, or, conversely,\\n      pelvic lesions may exist independently of nervous prostration.\\n      Nevertheless, the two are frequently associated, and this fact ought, I\\n      believe, to be kept in mind in dealing with the affection known as\\n      neurasthenia. Hysterical manifestations nearly always come to the surface\\n      in nervous prostration, and they also frequently attend pelvic lesions.\\n      Indeed, the term \"hystero-psychosis\" has been coined for the\\n      purpose of defining certain psychical disturbances of presumably pelvic\\n      origin, and in the broadest sense neurasthenia is not uncommonly an\\n      hysteroneurosis. It is the frequent association of these three conditions\\n      which, it seems to me, makes it more practicable to study them conjointly.\\n      \\n The special symptoms of nervous\\n      prostration are most variable. Introspection, as Dr. Wesselhoeft has\\n      pointed out, makes of the patient a nosomaniac. The anaemic nerve centres\\n      are unduly impressionable, and a mental shock which would not seriously\\n      affect a stronger and more rugged woman falls with crushing force upon one\\n      whose nutrition is already depraved. In this way are developed disorders\\n      of sensibility, alternations of mobility, circulatory disturbances,\\n      anomalies of secretion and exertion, disorders of the gastro-intestinal\\n      canal, dermatoses, and general and psychical disturbances of all kinds.\\n      Many of these affections start from pelvic lesions, and are nearly always\\n      associated with depravity of nutrition and more or less nervous\\n      prostration.\\n      \\n Some of the worst symptoms of\\n      neurasthenia with which I have had to contend have been hyperaesthesia of\\n      the articulations, giving rise to the so-called \"hysterical\\n      joint.\" Here the prostration is usually not profound, and it is\\n      possible to apply the somewhat energetic treatment recommended by Dr.\\n      Wesselhoeft. I remember one case very distinctly, the detailed history of\\n      which I shall give in another place, which brought me much reputation\\n      because of the \"remarkable\" cure I was fortunate enough to make.\\n      \\n The patient, a beautiful girl of\\n      eighteen, had been bed- ridden for three years with supposed hip-joint\\n      disease. She was in college before assuming the ride of an invalid, and\\n      worried much over her studies and work. She sustained a fall a short time\\n      previously to taking to her bed, and to this fall the injury to the hip\\n      was attributed. She had been from physician to physician and from\\n      sanitarium to sanitarium without receiving benefit. All of the numerous\\n      medical men under whose care she had been, directed their attention to the\\n      hip and applied the classical treatment for morbus coxarius without avail.\\n      The patient had finally reached a point where introspection was her chief\\n      occupation and her mind dwelt almost continually upon a \"diseased\\n      hip.\" She was finally brought to me, coming in an invalid\\'s chair and\\n      looking the very picture of dependency. There was a slight degree of\\n      anaemia, though this was not marked. Notwithstanding the expression\\n      expression of abjectness the girl did not look seriously ill. The hip was\\n      excessively tender upon pressure, but there was no local increase of\\n      temperature, no evidences of fever and suppuration, and forcible\\n      apposition by striking the heel was not very painful. More less spastic\\n      contraction of the flexor muscles of the affected side existed, which gave\\n      to the limb an appearance of actual shortening, which was very deceptive.\\n      Hysterical symptoms were common. On examination I found the left ovary\\n      exquisitely tender. Compression of the ovary increased the pain in the hip\\n      most decidedly and gave rise to much nervous agitation. I did not,\\n      therefore, deem it wise to recommend local treatment other than the daily\\n      use of the hot douche. She had long been a victim of ovarian\\n      dysmenorrhoea. I placed upon the ankle of the affected limb three pounds\\n      of bar-lead, prescribed a pair of crutches and insisted upon her walking.\\n      The lead was used to overcome the spastic contraction as well as for its\\n      moral effect. I did not deem the joint lesion of such a character as to\\n      used extension. In two months\\' time this patient discarded her crutches\\n      for a cane. Six weeks later she put up the cane and is now perfectly well.\\n      \\n This was a case in which somewhat harsh\\n      measures were eminently appropriate.\\n      \\n In marked contrast to the case just\\n      recorded is the following: Mrs.-, aet. 47, widow for twenty years. She is\\n      a devoted church-woman, and for years was a leader in all charitable work\\n      done in the community in which she resided. Through friends she was urged\\n      to consult me, and I think that the call to the neighboring town in which\\n      she lived was countermanded at least four or five times before the finally\\n      mustered up courage and strength enough to see me. Upon reaching the\\n      bedside I found my patient in a room made dark by closed blinds, over\\n      which were hung heavy blankets to shut out every ray of light. The mirror\\n      was turned toward the wall for fear a ray of light might strike it and\\n      flesh throughout the darkened room. Nor did the patient rest under these\\n      extreme precautions, for the eyes were protected with two pairs of colored\\n      glasses with side attachments. Hyperaesthesia of the sense of hearing was\\n      equally marked and the noise was excluded from the room by double doors\\n      whose keyholes were stuffed with cotton. She l so had her ears filled with\\n      cotton, over which she wore ear-mufflers. She was emaciated to an extreme\\n      degree, and had been reduced to her miserable condition by a series of\\n      events which frequently precede profound neurasthenia. Her husband was\\n      killed during the war, and she was left childless. Twelve months previous\\n      to taking to her bed she nursed her mother through a long and fatal\\n      illness. This greatly prostrated her, yet she kept up until a favorite\\n      brother-in-law was thrown from a carriage and killed. This was the last\\n      straw, and the shock compelled her to take to her bed. In due time loss of\\n      appetite with irritability of the stomach developed, which, of course, led\\n      to marked depravity of nutrition. With the anaemia came hyperaesthesia of\\n      the special senses, spinal irritation, headache, hysterical\\n      manifestations, etc. There was no series pelvic lesion, although she had\\n      been much treated for an alleged uterine displacement with congestion.\\n      Unfortunately, she was encouraged, instead of discouraged, in her\\n      invalidism, and she soon became a nosomaniac of the worst type. She had\\n      written down her symptoms one at a time, and the record is such a typical\\n      one that I should like to give it in full, but time forbids.\\n      \\n With great difficulty the patient was\\n      moved on a cough to a private hospital and placed under the Weir Mitchell\\n      treatment. I ignored the pelvic trouble entirely. It is unnecessary to\\n      give in detail the progress of the case from day to day after this\\n      treatment was inaugurated. Suffice it to say that the improvement was of\\n      the most marked character, and in six weeks from the time she entered the\\n      hospital she walked to her carriage with her eyes and ears unprotected.\\n      She soon resumed her church and charitable work, in which she again takes\\n      much delight.\\n      \\n This woman wanted to get well. She was\\n      a woman of pure motives and high ideals. She had, in the language of Dr.\\n      Wesselhoeft, the wish, but, unaided, not the will. She required the aid of\\n      an intelligent, strong-minded, nurse who could bring to her exercise\\n      applied in such a way as to enable her to assimilate food without the\\n      expenditure of nerve force. She co- operated with her physician and nurse\\n      in every possible way, and as soon as the anaemic nerve cells became\\n      flushed with new blood she began to improve. To have commanded this\\n      patient \"to take up her bed and walk\" before improving her\\n      nutrition would have been as unscientific as to have placed the first\\n      patient in bed with extension and counter-extension applied to the limb. I\\n      know of no class of cases requiring for their successful treatment more\\n      tact and discrimination than that under consideration.\\n      \\n I feel confident that I have many times\\n      cut the affection short in its prodromal stage by removing the girl from\\n      college work and insisting upon open-air exercise. Static electricity has,\\n      in my hands, proved exceedingly useful both during the prodromal stage and\\n      that of convalescence.\\n      \\n I will conclude by saying that I have\\n      been impressed with the frequency with which an hereditary history of\\n      epilepsy has been met with in the cases of neurasthenia passing under my\\n      observation.'\n",
      " 'Tresorie - SOME OF THE DISEASES PREVENTING AND COMPLICATION PREGNANCY\\n[Diseases Preventing & Complicating Pregnancy]\\n\\n STERILITY.-DeSinety, Treub, Furbinger,\\n      et al., attribute 50 per cent. of unproductive marriages to the husbands,\\n      saying that sterility in the male is more often the cause of barren\\n      marriages than is generally supposed.\\n      \\n This cause of sterility I pass by, as\\n      also sterility due to mechanical obstruction, incomplete ovulation and the\\n      numerous other causes of this condition, too manifold for mere\\n      enumeration, to consider obesity as a causative agent in this condition. I\\n      need not say that the advocates for surgical interference for the relief\\n      of this condition are legion. Sims makes the assertion that sterility can\\n      be cured by surgical means only. That, of course, is Allopathic arguing\\n      pure and simple. Cases requiring surgical interference do arise, but any\\n      treatment which raises the nutrition of the entire organism, improves the\\n      blood-formation, and favors the resorption of pathological products in the\\n      sexual organs, is to be regarded as the indicated remedy.\\n      \\n Published statements are my authority\\n      for saying that excellent results have followed the administration of\\n      drugs, nevertheless; and in complete defiance of all therapeutic measures,\\n      a certain percentage of women remain barren; for with the more occult\\n      causes of sterility we remain, as yet, unacquainted, consequently they\\n      cannot all be reached with say kind of treatment whatever.\\n      \\n The following case I report somewhat in\\n      detail. Whilst not an exceptional case at all, it bears directly upon the\\n      subject under consideration, and possesses, it seems to me, some decidedly\\n      interesting features. My object in selecting this particular one is to\\n      call attention, if possible, to a condition not sufficiently considered.\\n      Mrs. J., aet. 26, married about two years and a half, appealed to my\\n      knowledge for a reason as to why she remained childless. The lady was\\n      carrying an excess of flesh, being under the medium height, and weighing\\n      186 pounds, but appeared to be in good health; family and previous history\\n      all that could be desired. Examination showed none of the common causes of\\n      sterility; neither, so far as I could ascertain, was the husband\\n      responsible for this unproductive condition of affairs. Some previous\\n      experiences of my own, with the added testimony of other and able men, was\\n      my reason for charging this condition of things to the excess of flesh,\\n      this, by the husband, being laughingly charged to excess of laziness.\\n      \\n We all, undoubtedly, are familiar with\\n      that peculiar disease of the blood-corpuscles which, whilst producing\\n      flesh, relaxes at the same time the muscular force; acting also, I\\n      believe, upon the muscular fibres of the uterus and upon the ovaries,\\n      inducing not only serious menstrual disorders but sterility. McKee,\\n      Philbert, and others give several instances of sterility chargeable to\\n      obesity, the women in question having been married several years without\\n      bearing children, and all became mothers after losing a portion of their\\n      flesh. If any other argument were needed in support of this theory we\\n      might turn to the quadrupeds, where we find the poorest breeders among the\\n      fleshiest animals. Fournel has a very able treatise on \"The Effects\\n      of Obesity on the Menstrual Functions and Parturition.\" Without\\n      having had any actual case of this description to deal with, he inclines\\n      very strongly towards the belief that obesity favors sterility. In the\\n      treatment of the case before mentioned, the patient was subjected to a\\n      daily massage of the entire body, with a special pelvic massage three\\n      times a week. This, in the main, consists in elevating the uterus as high\\n      as possible with the finger in the vagina, ending with a quick and decided\\n      vibratory motion. The diet received particular attention, as at this time\\n      there was a slight gastric ailment. The indicated remedy, Thuja, was given\\n      in the minimum dose. At the end of three months almost thirty pounds of\\n      flesh was gone, a considerable reduction. As an experiment, I recommended\\n      coitus in the knee-elbow position, advising that the lady remain quiet as\\n      long as possible after coition, with thighs well flexed. She became\\n      enciente, but miscarried at eight weeks. There was, comparatively\\n      speaking, but little pain and not much subsequent haemorrhage. She made a\\n      rapid recovery. Since then a living child has been born to them.\\n      \\n I believe I am safe in saying that this\\n      result would hardly have obtained were it not for the prophylactic\\n      measures adopted.\\n      \\n At the end of the first two months the\\n      patient was attacked with haemorrhage. A similar occurrence took place at\\n      irregular intervals during the following five months, the quantity of\\n      blood lost being much greater than that at the normal menstrual period.\\n      \\n For the greater part of the last five\\n      months she kept her bed, at the end of which time the tendency of the\\n      uterus to empty itself could be resisted no longer. A seven months\\' child\\n      was born, and is to-day doing well.\\n      \\n Pseudocyesis cerebral pregnancy,\\n      phantom pregnancy (whatever name we may call it by) is a disease which\\n      must come under the head of those \"complicating pregnancy.\" Mrs.\\n      M., a lady, married two or three years, aet. 29. Previous history good,\\n      always enjoying perfect health. When I first saw the lady in question she\\n      was a perfect picture of health, and, according to appearance and her own\\n      statements, about seven months pregnant. I made no examination. This\\n      appeared to be a thoroughly intelligent woman, and, according to her own\\n      statement, there was cessation of the menses. There certainly was an\\n      enlargement of the abdomen and breasts, a milky secretion, and the lady\\n      was sure that she felt foetal movement. On February 28th of the present\\n      year I was called to attend her in labor. Examination showed that no\\n      pregnancy existed. So far as I could ascertain there was no assignable\\n      origin for this condition other than nervous influences, the phenomena\\n      being purely muscular distension of the abdomen.\\n      \\n Mayham reports a case of a woman 73\\n      years old, claiming to be pregnant; he also claims that subsequently she\\n      was delivered of a child; this is an Allopathic report, however, of which\\n      we will take a Homoeopathic dose. Haultain reports three cases of cerebral\\n      pregnancy. In the first, he says no cause whatever was to be found; in the\\n      second, there was a small fibroid growth in the anterior uterine wall.\\n      Hauck reports a case where the vomiting, peristalsis, and flatus, caused\\n      by alcoholism were supposed to be caused by the pregnant state. Such cases\\n      are uncommon, but they emphasize the importance of making a thorough\\n      examination, in all cases where positive information is desired of the\\n      existence or non-existence of pregnancy.\\n      \\n Hyperemesis Gravidarum.-An animated\\n      discussion, held recently between two celebrated Allopaths of Stuttgart\\n      and Leipsic, has served to awaken a renewed interest in this subject,\\n      without in the least adding anything new to our stock of knowledge\\n      regarding its aetiology. Notwithstanding the frequency of the vomiting of\\n      pregnancy, its very distressing character in many instances, and its\\n      imminent, its very distressing character in many instances, and its\\n      imminent danger, we find but very few contributions of any value, to\\n      either the aetiology of the disorder or its therapeutics. I do not expect\\n      to add anything specially new myself, but it does seem to me that our\\n      knowledge of the vomiting of pregnancy, is to say the least, in a most\\n      contradictory state. Some physicians look upon it as a trifling matter,\\n      others as a thing to be endured, and some-these are in the right too-view\\n      even the mildest cases with gravity. Even in the mildest cases of morning\\n      sickness there is a constant drain upon the nervous system, putting the\\n      sufferer into a condition, in which she is very much less able to endure\\n      parturition than she would otherwise have been.\\n      \\n Dr. Harrison Mettler says: \"After\\n      careful inquiry I find that women who suffer from much morning sickness\\n      have as a rule, tedious or otherwise troublesome labors. I have observed\\n      in multiparae that at one time they will have much nausea and vomiting\\n      followed by a difficult labor, while at another time they will be quite\\n      free from the vomiting, and will pass through the succeeding labor with\\n      comparative ease.\" I must say my observations make me agree with Dr.\\n      Mettler entirely; when one thinks how rapidly the mildest of cases assume\\n      pernicious forms, indifference is certainly no longer to be excused. There\\n      is a voluminous literature upon this subject, and many and varied are the\\n      aetiological reasons given for this very variable affection, a large\\n      majority of writers coinciding in the opinion that \"many causes\\n      operate together,\" to produce what we are pleased to designate the\\n      \"vomiting of pregnancy.\" I believe myself that in a large\\n      percentage of cases, this pernicious vomiting is simply the result of a\\n      reflex neurosis. Undoubtedly uterine displacements frequently cause\\n      vomiting; but when this is so, and the displaced organ is raised by\\n      packing the vagina with aseptic wool, the vomiting ceases.\\n      \\n Lillie reports a number of cases, where\\n      obstinate vomiting was caused by a retroflexed uterus, and restoration of\\n      the organ caused a cessation of the disorder. Bezugloff having a\\n      persistent case of morning sickness, introduced a bougie it no the uterus,\\n      the intention being to produce abortion; the immediate result was a\\n      stoppage of the vomiting, and the pregnancy went on to full term.\\n      \\n In the case just cited, I must say that\\n      I believe it was the fright, caused by the thought of abortion being\\n      performed, more than the effects of introducing the bougie, which operated\\n      so successfully; I say now, as I said before, I believe that the\\n      pre-eminent cause of this kind of sickness must be looked for i the\\n      nervous system. Flint speaks of this form of sickness as being decidedly\\n      neurotic in its origin, and cites a number of cases of a chronic variety\\n      of dyspepsia frequently occurring in young girls. I had one such case come\\n      under my personal care. There was a persistent morning sickness, with this\\n      young lady, and a disagreeable nausea whenever food was taken; this\\n      patient was at some distance from her home, in a boarding school, and she\\n      will probably never know that the lady principal entertained very grave\\n      thoughts at one time in regard to her virtue. It certainly was very\\n      difficult to differentiate between this and the vomiting of pregnancy; it\\n      was, however, simply due to a vitiated nervous system. My theory is\\n      supported by Alt, who records a number of such cases; I cite one only, the\\n      case being that of a highly hysterical woman, six months pregnant,\\n      suffering from the gravest vomiting, and anxious that miscarriage be\\n      induced. She was making preparation for entering the hospital for this\\n      purpose, when one of her children was seized with pneumonia. The anxiety\\n      felt over the child, forced all thought of self from the mother\\'s mind;\\n      from that moment the vomiting ceased and she remained well until the\\n      termination of pregnancy.-Minchener Medicinische Wochenschrift.\\n      \\n Whilst saying that I believe this\\n      disease to be in the majority of cases of purely nervous origin, I would\\n      not imply thereby that it is not to be feared, far from it; if neglected,\\n      we know how likely it is to pass quickly beyond treatment and our patient\\n      succumb from sheer exhaustion.\\n      \\n In the treatment cited such as\\n      insertion of bougies, dilation of the os, pelvic massage, etc., I believe\\n      it is merely the \"doing something,\" no matter much what it is,\\n      so long as you have gained the confidence of your patient, that does good.\\n      We have seen how suddenly Hyperemesis will cease if the patient be\\n      alarmed; it may be, has often been, and will to again, cured by a process\\n      skin to suggestion. Kattenback had a case where the patient, a primipara,\\n      was seized with an incorrigible vomiting. It was suggested to her that her\\n      stomach contained some lumps of unwholesome material and their removal\\n      would cure her. Some milk was given her, and the stomach ceremoniously\\n      washed out. its contents bore no indications of either over-acidity or\\n      abnormal ferment She was informed that she was all right and the vomiting\\n      would not return; neither did if, and she was safely delivered at term.\\n      \\n There is a familiar and now well-know\\n      phenomena, by which these neurotics can be influenced; I speak of\\n      hypnotism; it is due to purely subjective conditions.\\n      \\n There is an identity of the hypnotic\\n      susceptibility with the condition of hysteria, and it is along these lines\\n      that we can work.

It must recognize too, that\\n      the sick individual has to take an active part in his treatment and not be\\n      merely the passive recipient of this or that treatment. For just as it is\\n      rightly said that man does not live by alone, so should it be emphasized\\n      that man cannot be cured by medicine alone. He must see to it himself that\\n      he lives as far as possible a physically and psychically healthy life.\\n      Indeed, each individual has a power within himself to help in his own\\n      cure.\\n      \\n Do the official schools of medicine\\n      teach such an art today? I am afraid not: they are so intent on seeking\\n      the specific treatment for this or that named disease or the antibiotic\\n      that will most effectively put out of action the organism regarded as the\\n      cause of the disease, that they are losing sight of the individual\\n      himself.\\n      \\n But Homoeopathy in its persistent\\n      search for the reactions of the individual to his environment in the\\n      broadest sense, no matter of what the patient is complaining surely\\n      fulfills these requirements, especially when it is recognized that the\\n      homoeopathic potencies do not anything to the patient as do the drugs of\\n      the dominant school, but rather stimulate the patients own recuperative\\n      powers to overcome the infection or re - establish the normal metabolism\\n      which has become deranged by the illness.\\n      \\n When you consider how the homoeopathic\\n      physician diagnoses the individuality of his patient over and above the\\n      name of the disease from which he is suffering, and uses for the purpose\\n      of his prescription rather than the name of the disease this personal\\n      diagnosis of the patients mental and emotional reactions, his responses to\\n      changes in weather conditions, the alternations in his environment which\\n      influence his symptoms, etc., one realize how very individualistic is the\\n      Homoeopathic prescription fitted to that particular patient.\\n      \\n The homoeopathic physician does not\\n      seek for a remedy specific to any named disease and which he can thus\\n      apply almost automatically once he has made his organic diagnosis, which\\n      in quite an appreciable number of instances may ultimately be found to be\\n      wrong and so the treatment based upon it must therefore have been wrong.\\n      He does not, as is so often done, merely suppress the most outstanding\\n      symptom by an appropriate drug; for example giving an anodyne to mask the\\n      pain or removing the skin eruption by some strong local application, in\\n      other words putting the dust under the mat and pretending the room is\\n      clean.\\n      \\n Strangely enough the homoeopathic\\n      physician is often accused by his allopathic critic in his ignorance of\\n      Homoeopathy, of merely treating symptoms, whereas it is the critic himself\\n      who practices this superficial medicine. The homoeopathic physician, on\\n      the other hand, treats his patient as a whole through his symptoms and\\n      their modifications through changes in the environment, which is quite a\\n      different matter.\\n      \\n Homoeopathic therapy, unlike methods of\\n      treatment, is based on a natural law \"Similia Similibus\\n      Curentur\" \"Likes may be cured by likes\" which has been\\n      proved time and time again by experiment and which anyone with the will to\\n      do may prove for himself. It is not subject to constant change brought\\n      about by this or that latest discovery, and which itself will soon have to\\n      give way to the still later idea.\\n      \\n Having now introduced to you our actor,\\n      what of the scene in which he is to play his role?\\n      \\n This is the nineteen hundred and fifty\\n      - fourth year of the Christian era and the second year of the reign of our\\n      much loved and admired young Queen Elizabeth II, who will remember while\\n      in south Africa on her twenty - first birthday, before she had any idea\\n      that she would so soon be called to such an exalted position as she holds\\n      today, broadcast to the commonwealth and Empire her resolve to dedicate\\n      her life to the service of this grand community which dedication she\\n      recently repeated at her Coronation.\\n      \\n Here in Great Britain we have a more or\\n      less complete welfare state, with which idea some of us may very strongly\\n      disagree, whilst others believe such a development is the result of a\\n      natural very desirable social evolution.\\n      \\n As one necessary ingredient of this\\n      welfare state came, in 1948, the initiation of the National Health\\n      Service, through which the great majority of the population receives its\\n      medical attention, although it is rightly available to all.\\n      \\n When we come to consider the role that\\n      homoeo - therapeutics should play in this scheme, I would suggest that we\\n      should regard the problem from the purely medical aspect, forgetting any\\n      political party allegiances or sympathies we may have; or if we cannot\\n      forget them we should remember that the organization of the National\\n      Insurance Scheme of which the National Health Service is but a part, was\\n      first blue printed by the well - known Liberal supporter, Lord Beveridge,\\n      and the Health Service plans developed by the Coalition Government of all\\n      three major political parties.\\n      \\n We are living at present in an age\\n      which may very justifiably be regarded as a violent age in which have been\\n      developed so many appalling instruments of destruction, the use of some of\\n      which we are quite complacently accepting and from the use of others we\\n      are refraining, not because we consider them immoral, but simply through\\n      the fear of the wholesale destruction which would be caused by their use.\\n      We are seeing X-rays used in very high voltages in the treatment of\\n      cancer, we are being constantly remained of the use of dangerous drugs in\\n      medicine, without justification, in my opinion, bearing in mind the\\n      doubtful and evanescent ameliorations they produce and the violent\\n      surgical treatment of mental patients.\\n      \\n One further violence we should not\\n      forget is the way some of our foods are devitalized by the extraction of\\n      this or that portion of the natural product for purposes quite foreign to\\n      the well - being of the people who are to feed on them; or they are\\n      contaminated by the addition of this or that dangerous chemical, either\\n      during the growing of the plant, in the form of sprays, or as so called\\n      improvers in, for instance, the manufacture of white bread. It is very\\n      significant in this regard that quite a lot of attention is paid to the\\n      protection of the man who sprays the crops, but the right of the consumer\\n      to have uncontaminated food is slurred over by the unjustifiable statement\\n      that the amount of these chemicals so consumed is so small that it cannot\\n      have any bad effect on the consumer. We who practice Homoeopathy know how\\n      unwarranted is such a statement.\\n      \\n Can we homoeopathic physicians and\\n      patient hope to be able to do anything to make the still small voice of\\n      Homoeopathy heard in all this tumult, so that we may return to a saner and\\n      more healthful way of life and help our young Queen in her lifes work for\\n      the communitys sake?\\n      \\n Can we expect any help from the leaders\\n      of the medical profession? I am afraid not, because although I believe it\\n      accurate to state that there is a very slowly growing interest in, and\\n      tolerance of our work by individual doctors, the medical authorities are\\n      still, in their prejudice, strongly opposed to us. The London University\\n      still refuses to recognize our Hospital as a post - graduate teaching\\n      Hospital: the British Medical Association prohibits the formation of a\\n      homoeopathic section of its organization, and the Royal College of\\n      Physicians still refuses its membership to any one known as a homoeopathic\\n      physician. Yet in spite of this unfavourable environment, I firmly believe\\n      that there is a future for our method of therapeutics: but it will have to\\n      be pursued with courage, determination, foresight and energy. Surely if we\\n      believe as I do, that we are the guardians of a system of treatment\\n      destined to make our people healthier and therefore more efficient and\\n      happier, we would be failing in our duty to our country if we did not take\\n      every means in our power to acquaint the community at large with the\\n      advantages of this system and the dangers of ignoring it. This is a duty,\\n      not only of the profession, but also of the laity interested in\\n      Homoeopathy and who have experienced its benefits.\\n      \\n Every physician has two professional\\n      obligation to the community, that of preserving its health and that of\\n      endeavouring to restore it to being when it has fallen by the way.\\n      \\n The homoeopathic physician, thorough\\n      his knowledge acquired through the provings of drugs, even in\\n      infinitesimal doses, has, I believe, a very special responsibility as\\n      regards the prophylaxis of disease. It seems to me that a great deal of\\n      chronic ill health may quite conceivably be due to the manipulations of\\n      our foods and to the artificial manuring of the ground in which many of\\n      them are grown. Experiments have been carried our proving that plants\\n      grown in soil enriched by natural manuring, are much less prone to\\n      diseases than those grown with the help of artificial chemical manures. It\\n      seems a fairly justified conclusion that vegetables grown under these\\n      artificial conditions may quite well be deficient in something necessary\\n      for our perfect health. It is therefore incumbent upon the physician to\\n      advocate whenever possible the ingestion of healthily grown foods in the\\n      widest sense of that term.\\n      \\n The same duty applies when we consider\\n      the great amount of drugging in which the community at large indulges by\\n      its excessive smoking, particularly when aggravated by the practice of\\n      inhaling, and by the continued and prolonged use of drugs for this or that\\n      symptom, too often, unfortunately, though not always, on the prescription\\n      of their medical advisors.\\n      \\n There is a great lack throughout the\\n      community of any real enthusiasm for perfect health: we are only too prone\\n      to be content to follow like sheep, the unintelligent and harmful\\n      practices of the majority of our fellows.\\n      \\n Similarly in the curative realm, we\\n      homoeopathic physicians have special obligations.\\n      \\n When considering our position vis-a-vis\\n      the rest of the profession, we must never lose sight of the fact that our\\n      approach to the sick individual is a much broader and more comprehensive\\n      one than that of the dominant school. This latter prides itself on its\\n      scientific approach to its problems. One must, however, always be on ones\\n      guard against being hypnotized by that word scientific. The scientific\\n      aspect of any phenomenon or problem dealing with humanity is only one\\n      limited aspect of that problem. To get a complete picture one must\\n      consider other aspect, such as the aesthetic, emotional, maybe religious,\\n      and above all, perhaps one might say embracing all, the philosophical\\n      approach. This complex approach to his patients problem is the one that\\n      the homoeopathic physician always strives to adopt, and so never loses\\n      sight of the ego of the patient, while at the same time not forgetting his\\n      physical make - up.\\n      \\n Because this approach of ours to our\\n      patients is a much broader and more comprehensive one than the much\\n      vaunted scientific aspect, which the dominant school has come to regard as\\n      the Ultima Thule of medicine, I deplore the oft - repeated request of some\\n      of my colleagues that we should forsake our philosophy and make our work\\n      as scientific as theirs. I do not mean to imply by this that we should\\n      neglect the scientific angle of our patients illness but we should always\\n      remember that is only one facet of our problem. That is why we take such\\n      pains to diagnose our patients personality with his reaction to his\\n      environment in addition to the physical diagnosis of the case in order to\\n      arrive at our prescription for his malady. In other words, we should\\n      endeavour to lead our dominant school colleagues to our way of thinking,\\n      rather than that we should adopt theirs.\\n      \\n At the same time must always remember\\n      that if our philosophy should seem at any time to contradict so - called\\n      scientific laws, we must re - examine our philosophy, and if necessary\\n      modify it, while at the same time remembering that many times in the past\\n      what have been regarded as laws have ultimately been proved not to be so.\\n      Thus it is evident that we must never relax our self - examination.\\n      \\n What shall be the role of the\\n      homoeopathic laity?\\n      \\n The first thing for them to remember is\\n      that we are living in a democratic country whose government is dependent\\n      on the goodwill of the governed, and that, if a sufficient number of\\n      voters desire a certain line of action, that line will be adopted by the\\n      government.\\n      \\n The second thought is that there are\\n      not nearly sufficient doctors practising Homoeopathy in Great Britain to\\n      satisfy the present demand, let alone any further increased demand in the\\n      future, for this line of treatment.\\n      \\n Does not this seem strange, having\\n      regard to the great advantage to humanity that Homoeopathy provides? Not\\n      if one looks below the surface and so finds the reason for this shortage.\\n      \\n Surely the most potent reason is that\\n      Homoeopathy is not taught in the official Medical Schools, either as a pre\\n      - or post - graduate study. The London University when asked to recognize\\n      the Royal London Homoeopathic Hospital as a post - graduate Medical\\n      School, refused on the plea that as Homoeopathy was not taught in the\\n      undergraduate Medical Schools, it could not find a place for it in its\\n      post - graduate curriculum.\\n      \\n It is, of course, nonsense to suggest\\n      that a graduate should pursue his studies only in those subject of which\\n      he had already obtained some knowledge in his undergraduate days and\\n      should not wish to obtain information on any new or extra subject.\\n      \\n The University Medical Shools are\\n      enabled to a great extent through Government grants. We must therefore\\n      find some way of influencing whatever Government be in power to bring\\n      pressure to bear upon the London University to remove this obstacle to the\\n      better health of the community at large. I am quite satisfied that once\\n      this academic recognition is obtained we shave many more post - graduate\\n      students of Homoeopathy.\\n      \\n I believe than in a democratic\\n      community, having a universal State Medical Service, it is the bounden\\n      duty of the Government to remove all obstacles to the peoples obtaining\\n      that form of medical treatment in which they have confidence. So long as\\n      Homoeopathy is denied its legitimate status, so long must be Government be\\n      deemed to b failing in its duty to the country.\\n      \\n If, however, we are to achieve this\\n      desirable object of full recognition, we must all, professional and laity,\\n      be fired with enthusiasm, not only for the abstract cause of Homoeopathy,\\n      but for being partners with our young Queen in delicating our lives to the\\n      community.\\n      \\n When we do this we shall help to make\\n      this second Elizabethan era one to be remembered throughout the ages to\\n      come as surpassing the first Elizabethan era in that it gained not so much\\n      the economic and political leadership of the world - though that is not to\\n      be despised - but showed the way to the most healthful and spiritual way\\n      of life that all the world look notice and followed suit.\\n      \\n To sum up, the Role of Homoeopathy, as\\n      I see it, is to humanize the practice of medicine. By that I mean it must\\n      bring the practice of medicine into line with a reasoned philosophy of\\n      life, restore to it its artistry and rid it of all unnecessary hazards. It\\n      is to do this, not from any abstract academic sense of superiority, but in\\n      order the years to come are not those of merely another reign, but to\\n      ensure a veritable Renaissance, starting with the second Elizabethan era\\n      in which Great Britain will take its rightful place in the comity of\\n      nations as the pathfinder to a way of life for which posterity will be\\n      able to say \"Thank God for Queen Elizabeth the Second and her\\n      peoples.'\n",
      " 'Tresorie - Roentgenometric Pelvimetry [Roentgenometric Pelvimetry]\\n CHARLES W.PERKINS, M.D.\\n      \\n Norwalk, Conn\\n      \\n FOR some time the x-ray has been used\\n      to advantage in diagnosis of multiple pregnancy, position of fetus and\\n      fetal abnormalities. However, it has been only the past four or five years\\n      that any definite information has been obtained by roentgenographic\\n      methods of diagnoses in pelvimetry.\\n      \\n At the present time we are convinced\\n      that only by means of roentgenographs can be true proportions of the\\n      superior strait be determined, and that the ordinary external methods of\\n      Pelvimetry are not only occasionally misleading but proportionately\\n      inaccurate.\\n      \\n The present communication deals with\\n      the method of Herbert Thomas of Yale University. This method was developed\\n      in cooperation with the late Dr. W.A. Lafield, who was Professor of\\n      Roentgenology at the Yale Medical School.\\n      \\n Some of the reasons why roentgen\\n      pelvimetry has not been more universally adopted are probably due to the\\n      following factors.\\n      \\n (1) The majority of women will be\\n      delivered normally, whether or not pelvic measurements are made.\\n      \\n (2) The medical profession does not\\n      readily accept a new method after an established satisfactory routine has\\n      been in use.\\n      \\n (3) A new method of diagnosis incurs\\n      added expense.\\n      \\n (4) The present methods, although\\n      entirely speculative, are satisfactory in most cases.\\n      \\n (5) Roentgen pelvimetry cannot be\\n      performed by the obstetrician himself but requires the aid of a\\n      roentgenologist.\\n      \\n (6) The value of roentgenometric\\n      diagnosis is recent in origin and as yet not universally accepted.\\n      \\n If the knowledge of the size and shape\\n      of the pelvis is necessary to the practice of obstetrics, roentgen\\n      pelvimetry is a sound procedure, particularly in pre-emptors patients, and\\n      should and should be considered as an indispensable aid in these cases.\\n      \\n The method of Herbert Thoms as\\n      developed at Yale Medical School is not the only method. However, it can\\n      be classified as simple, accurate and rapid; being adaptable for use by\\n      other than experts in x-ray and obstetric diagnosis. As a technical\\n      procedure a well trained hospital technician can master its technic alter\\n      sufficient instruction.\\n      \\n Studies of recent years reveal the fact\\n      that external Pelvimetry fails to give uniform and accurate information in\\n      regard to the shape and size of the superior strait. This is often true of\\n      thin undersized individuals. In many patients of this type external\\n      measurements may suggest a contracted pelvis while the x-ray will show a\\n      relatively large pelvis with a subsequent natural labor and normal-sized\\n      child. On the other hand a stocky short person with similar external\\n      measurements will disclose a contracted pelvis which is an obstetric\\n      problem. Because of the apparent relationship between shortening of the\\n      transverse diameter and a secondary persistent occipito-posterior\\n      presentation, accurate information regarding this diameter is of clinical\\n      significance.\\n      \\n The observations of Thomas were made on\\n      twenty consecutive patients whose pelvis showed a relative or real\\n      shortening of the transverse diameter of the superior strait. In every\\n      instance a primary or secondary occipito posterior position was found\\n      after the patient was in labor. (Herbert Thoms, Surgery, Gynecology and\\n      Obstetrics, January, 1933). It therefore has been proved that an actual or\\n      relative shortening of a transverse diameter of the superior strait\\n      results in a limitation of space that is greater in the anterior than in\\n      the posterior half of the superior strait. Under these circumstances, when\\n      the head descends early in labor, the occiput is forced to rotate\\n      posteriorly.\\n      \\n The x-ray offers additional information\\n      in determining the size of the fetal head. It has been noted in x-ray\\n      examination of the unengaged fetal head that it lay with the transverse\\n      diameter of the superior strait, the occiput being either to the right or\\n      left; therefore, if roentgenogram of the patient is taken in the supine\\n      position with the fetus in the uterus, it will cast a shadow which is an\\n      enlarged profile of the head. The measurements of the occipital frontal\\n      diameter of the head can then be made. On numerous occasions this method\\n      of cephalometry, determining the diameter of the unmoulded head before and\\n      after cesarean section, has yielded accurate results. (Thomas, A.M.A.,\\n      February 24, 1934).\\n      \\n As experience increases in roentgen\\n      pelvimetry, the so-called labor test will be employed less. This, however,\\n      does not mean that the physician should not under estimate the importance\\n      of uterine contraction and the ability of the fetal head to mold. It has\\n      always followed that when something could be proved desirable in medicine\\n      for the better protection of the patient, such an advance would be\\n      demanded and eventually become routine. We may concede, therefore, that\\n      roentgen pelvimetry has a distinct place in the examination of every\\n      primiparous woman. In many instances, according to Thomas and others,\\n      external; measurements were normal but the x-ray examination revealed a\\n      contracted pelvis. On the other had, in certain patients whose external\\n      measurements suggested a cesarean section roentgen pelvimetry proved\\n      otherwise and they were subsequently delivered in a normal manner.\\n      \\n CENTIMETER GRID METHOD.\\n      \\n The procedure in this method may be\\n      summarized by stating the following:.\\n      \\n (1) The patient is placed on the\\n      roentgenographic table in the semi- recumbent position.\\n      \\n (2) The level of the superior strait\\n      above the sensitized film is established.\\n      \\n (3) The tube target is centered about\\n      five centimeters posterior to the symphysis, at thirty-two inches from the\\n      sensitized film, The exposure is made.\\n      \\n (4) The patient is removed from the\\n      table, the tube target and sensitized film remaining in situ.\\n      \\n (5) A lead plate, or centimeter grid,\\n      with perforations exactly one centimeter apart, is introduced into the\\n      same plane as that previously occupied by the superior strait and a second\\n      (flash) exposure is made on the same sensitized film as was used used in\\n      the previous exposure.\\n      \\n (6) Development of the film shows the\\n      outline of the superior strait and the shadows of the perforations, the\\n      assistance between which represents centimeters in the plane of the\\n      superior strait. The anteroposterior and transverse diameters of the\\n      superior strait in its use proportions may be drawn on centimeter-square\\n      paper by following the course of the shadow of the superior strait and\\n      transcribing it.\\n      \\n As this time I wish to express my\\n      thanks to Dr. Thoms for his personal advice and instruction which helped\\n      me to master the technic of his method.'\n",
      " 'Tresorie - NOTATU DIGNUM [Test Of A Homoeopath]\\n\\n Complaints are not unfrequently made\\n      that the homoeopathic materia medica is too vast for practical utility;\\n      that the schematised list of symptoms are unprofitable, if not impossible\\n      reading.

Indeed, I think that the test of a genuine\\n      homoeopath might not unfairly be said to life in his capacity to read\\n      through a Schema with both profit and enjoyment because of the\\n      possibilities it reveals of dealing with cases occurring every day in\\n      practice.

Behind the diaphragm is a shallow air-tight compartment,\\n      leading from which are rubber tubes that are inserted in the external\\n      auditory canal during treatment, consequently any vibratory motion of the\\n      diaphragm, which must necessarily be an inward and a corresponding outward\\n      movement, would be exactly reproduced upon the membrana tympani, as the\\n      confined air, not being able to escape, will undergo an alternate\\n      condensation and rarefication in the external auditory canal.\\n      \\n Every vibratory movement of the strings\\n      of the instrument is communicated to the diaphragm by means of the bridge\\n      upon which it rests. These strings by varying their tension and length can\\n      be regulated to give a high or low rate of vibration as desired, for\\n      instance, the heaviest string left at its original length adjusted to a\\n      slight tension may make about fifty vibratory motions to the second, while\\n      the highest string on the instrument adjusted to a high tension and\\n      clamped down to one-fourth its original length would probably make three\\n      thousand vibratory motions to the second.\\n      \\n In the centre of the diaphragm is an\\n      attachment which works on a lever, and when hit by the cam on the\\n      revolving shaft lifts the diaphragm to a considerable extent, causing a\\n      powerful effect on the membrana tympani. This attachment can be adjusted\\n      at four different leverages, which causes a modification or increase of\\n      its intensity and can be regulated at from one to twenty-five vibratory\\n      movements to the second. This is only used in very bad cases and for not\\n      more than five minutes continuously.\\n      \\n The instrument which I have been\\n      describing in an improvement on the first manufactured, and as far as I\\n      know, is the only one which offers the same facilities for applying this\\n      method of massage. The class of patients in my experience who are\\n      generally benefited from the first, are those in which the mucous membrane\\n      lining the tympanic cavity and Eustachian tubes is in a hypertrophic\\n      condition. The membrana tympani are depressed, opaque, and thickened. They\\n      usually complain of a stiffed sensation in the ears, with a great deal of\\n      tinnitus aurium, and that their hearing is worse during a cold. In cases\\n      where the mucous membranes are atrophied with a large external auditory\\n      canal perfectly dry and Eustachian tubes patulous, and generally very\\n      little tinnitus, this or no other treatment has done very much good in the\\n      majority of cases, and in looking ever my records I find that only about\\n      five per cent. have been relieved, while in the before-mentioned cases the\\n      good results reach at least seventy-five per cent. In treating persons, I\\n      always select the rate of vibration which corresponds in pitch, if\\n      possible, to that caused by the diseased condition of the ears. If there\\n      is no tinnitus to guide me, I find whether the patient can hear a high or\\n      low sound better; if it is a low sound, a high rate of vibration is used\\n      in treatment, and vice versa, A point which I would like to explain here\\n      is this: It is not necessary that the sound from the instrument should be\\n      of the same quality of the tinnitus experienced by the patient, but merely\\n      the same pitch. for instance, if a banjo, where one of the strings was\\n      adjusted when sounded to produce a certain note, and a musical instrument\\n      of any other kind, whose quality of tone was entirely different, was made\\n      to sound the same note in a room, the string on the banjo would vibrate in\\n      sympathy, which has been proven by experiment, any other note, no matter\\n      how loud, would have no effect. Another point is in the way the strings of\\n      the vibrometer are set in motion. On the revolving shaft is a wheel\\n      projecting from which are metallic picks which hit the string it is\\n      adjusted over. It does not make any difference in the number of vibratory\\n      motions per second, whether the string is hit fast or slow, but at the\\n      time the string is first hit the intensity is greater than it is just\\n      before being hit again, and as the motion of the wheel is perfectly\\n      rhythmic, revolving so many times to the second, it has just as good an\\n      effect as if the intensity during the fraction of a second did not vary at\\n      all. The idea of using vibratory motion, as I have said before, originated\\n      within my mind some years ago, and later put into practical operation, and\\n      as far as I know, was the first to lay before the profession in a\\n      scientific manner, this method of massage.\\n      \\n I have found that when two of the\\n      strings upon the vibrometer were regulated in such a way that when both\\n      were set in vibration at the same time, producing the sensation of a\\n      harmonious sound, the effect in some cases on the tinnitus was especially\\n      beneficial, relieving, where the various kinds of vibrations produced by a\\n      single string failed. Sub-acute cases of deafness, accompanied by tinnitus\\n      aurium, are quickly relieved, as the following case will illustrate:.\\n      \\n Mrs. M. Young, married lady, aet. 26,\\n      called at my office, April 1, 1893, complaining of partial deafness and\\n      tinnitus aurium. She had a stuffed sensation, or as if cotton had been\\n      packed in the external auditory canal. She says the tinnitus was so\\n      annoying as to prevent sleep. On examination, found considerable\\n      retraction of the membrana tympani, and hearing for the watch, on the\\n      right side five inches, on the left, seven inches. The Eustachian tube\\n      were partially closed, which made inflation somewhat difficult, giving\\n      slight relief. I used several of the vibrations on the different strings\\n      without immediate benefit.\\n      \\n April 4th.-She came again, and reported\\n      that no improvement had taken place. I again inflated her ears, after\\n      which she sat down to the vibrometer. The central attachment was used with\\n      considerable force continuously for four minutes, after which she declared\\n      that the tinnitus had entirely ceased in the right ear, and greatly\\n      modified in the left; the hearing for the watch had increased for both\\n      ears to fourteen inches, and the stuffed sensation had almost entirely\\n      disappeared. On inspection of the membrana tympani, found them\\n      comparatively very slightly retracted. On April 8th, found improvement had\\n      continued, when the same treatment was used for three minutes; after which\\n      she declared herself completely relieved of the tinnitus and stuffed\\n      sensation, with hearing powerfully restored. Saw her again on April 13th,\\n      when she declared the good results from last treatment to have still\\n      continued.\\n      \\n I find that in the majority of cases,\\n      when the strings of the instrument are used it is only necessary to strike\\n      them lightly with the friction wheel. In vibrating the heavy string, I\\n      generally set the bridge back behind the central attachment, and adjusting\\n      the motor in such way that the belt is at a considerable tension, so that\\n      the pulley-wheel revolves slowly. I also generally use this adjustment\\n      when setting in motion two strings at one time. The principle of this\\n      method of treatment embraces two essential features which to my mind makes\\n      this system of massage the only scientific one applicable to the membrana\\n      tympani and its associate sound-conducting parts. Message is the\\n      application of motion to disease, and its scientific administration\\n      consists of its application in a systematic manner. In applying massage in\\n      aural diseases, it is necessary to produce a to-and-fro movement of the\\n      membrana tympani, and, if possible, by a force which is harmless and at\\n      the same time effective. The vibrometer fulfils these conditions. Any of\\n      the strings on the instrument that may be set in motion by the\\n      friction-wheel, will produce a certain number of vibratory movements to\\n      the second of time, and the movements of the central attachment are also\\n      measured. What could be more systematic than this? The motions of the\\n      membrana tympani were intended by nature to its vibratory, and as the\\n      vibrometer generates measured motion, and these motions are vibratory,\\n      theoretically we have a scientific and effective method of massage in\\n      aural diseases; and, as demonstrated practically by the use of the\\n      vibrometer, we have in fact a great scientific advance over all previous\\n      methods. Since the introduction of this treatment in aural diseases, it\\n      makes possible a more or less benefit in cases of deafness heretofore\\n      considered hopeless, and has opened up the field for the treatment of\\n      aural diseases to such an extent that the number of deaf patients seeking\\n      relief at the aurist\\'s hands will at least double itself.\\n      \\n DISCUSSION.\\n      \\n H.C. HOUGHTON, M.D.: Dr. Garey\\'s\\n      admirable paper gives us the description of the vibrometer, an instrument\\n      devised under his personal direction and inspection, for the purpose of\\n      applying massage to the ear. It is the only instrument of the kind on the\\n      market, so far as I am aware, and after a somewhat prolonged use of it, I\\n      am prepared to recommend the latest production of the vibrometer company.\\n      \\n This instrument is a decided\\n      improvement over the instrument first sent out, and is capable of\\n      producing a most profound effect upon the drum-head and ossicula; indeed,\\n      upon the entire auditory apparatus. I am able to confirm Dr. Garey\\'s\\n      statement of the effect of high and low vibrations us regards treatment.\\n      \\n I have also been very much interested\\n      in the use of stringed or reed instruments for diagnosis, and find that we\\n      can detect any abnormal sensitiveness of the auditory nerve to high or low\\n      tones. Some patients are extremely sensitive to all tones, high or low;\\n      others to high tones and not to low tones; others, conversely. Again, in\\n      some instances, there is a peculiar sensitiveness to single tones or to\\n      discords produced by sounding the note and half-note at the same time.\\n      Under the action of the central attachment of the vibrometer this\\n      sensitiveness is modified, the sensitiveness to high tones disappearing\\n      and being replaced by a low tone or, conversely, under treatment, a low\\n      tone disappears and a high tone is established, temporarily, at least.\\n      Again, in cases of recent origin, treatment will substitute an undefined\\n      rushing sound for a definite musical tone, either high or low, and later,\\n      the treatment will abolish this, the patient being relieved of this\\n      intensely annoying symptom. In some cases, with this relief, there is an\\n      improvement in the audition; in other cases, no improvement follows.\\n      \\n I confess to the domination of the\\n      material over my mind in my earlier experience with massage, and I think\\n      the inclination of operators will be to use a far greater degree of power\\n      than is necessary. I therefore notice with great satisfaction Professor\\n      Garey\\'s remark that \"the object should be to produce a to-and-fro\\n      motion to the membrana tympani, and, if possible, by a force which is\\n      harmless and at the same time effective.\" I would hardly say\\n      \"to-and-fro motion of the drum-head,\" because I think that the\\n      expression is liable to perpetuate the motion which is fixed in the minds\\n      of most physiologists, that the drum-head moves as a whole, with a\\n      to-and-fro motion.\" That is true under the influence of the Politzer,\\n      Siegle\\'s otoscope and similar instruments; but it certainly does not so\\n      move in the ordinary function of audition, but stands as the iris does in\\n      the eye, as an adjustor, a regulator of sound-force; in some sense as the\\n      iris does in its relation with the lens, to adjust, regulate and direct\\n      the essential force, and the vibration of the drum-head is at every node;\\n      every portion receives impressions that are converted into molecular\\n      disturbances of varying lengths, according as they are produced upon the\\n      stiff and unyielding portions of the drum-head at the periphery, along the\\n      manubrium, or in the more attenuated and easily-yielding portions which\\n      the between these two areas. Not only so, but these impulses are\\n      communicated to the contained air of the tympanum, and make their\\n      impression upon the acoustic nerve through the round window synchronously\\n      with the impression made through the ossicula.\\n      \\n This whole subject widens before my\\n      mind in such a way that one might wish himself twenty years and at liberty\\n      to devote himself to a term of research in acoustics, such as is offered\\n      only in the technical schools of the continent of Europe.\\n      \\n WM. R. KING, M.D.: In discussing Dr.\\n      Garey\\'s paper I shall begin by saying that his methods have been closely\\n      followed by me since the beginning of his experiments, owing to the fact\\n      that I have been greatly interested in the treatment of deafness and\\n      tinnitus by means of sound waves or by aural massage since 1887, and have\\n      experimented and treated many cases by this method since then, though with\\n      crude and unsatisfactory instruments. Since using the vibrometer-which,\\n      after much study and experimentation, is now presented to the profession\\n      in practical shape-I have undoubtedly increased my percentage of good\\n      results.\\n      \\n I don\\'t believe I am over-sanguine or\\n      carried away by interest in this method, and believe I can rightly\\n      appreciate that this does not offer us a panacea or cure-all for auditory\\n      ailments, and hope I may always be ready to see the failures and to strive\\n      to find methods or remedies to reach some of them.\\n      \\n In speaking of the application of the\\n      instrument, I wish to call attention to the central attachment or post foe\\n      vibrations. Dr. Garey has not given it as much attention in the paper as\\n      it deserves. It is very useful as a general means of aural massage,\\n      rougher in nature and more general in application than the strings which\\n      help to make up the instrument. I often use it before applying the\\n      \"similar found\" to a given case, as a species of gymnastics, to\\n      stimulate secretion and motion in the conducting apparatus of the ear,\\n      viz., membrana tympani and ossicles. In most cases-in fact, in all-where\\n      tinnitus is present, I follow this up immediately by the nearest approach\\n      to the similar pitch obtainable.\\n      \\n I agree thoroughly with Dr. Garey, that\\n      the best results are achieved in cases accompanying hypertrophic catarrh,\\n      and that the least benefit is apparent in cases of atrophic nature.\\n      \\n Regarding the method of treatment in\\n      the absence of tinnitus, my experience the does not coincide with that of\\n      the author of the paper entirely; I do not feel that as yet we have any\\n      safe rule to guide us. My method has been to try the numerous sounds and\\n      variations the of until I find the one that seems to give the best\\n      immediate results, or that the patient himself will speak of as very\\n      penetrating and powerful )though not necessarily loud and heavy).\\n      \\n It seems almost impossible at present\\n      to simulate all the qualities of tone as they occur in the ears of those\\n      suffering with tinnitus; in fact, it would appear to be unnecessary.\\n      However, it seems advantageous and quite necessary to secure the closest\\n      simulation of pitch, thus in many cases soon obliterating annoying\\n      tinnitus and improving hearing powers.\\n      \\n The arrangement permitting of the\\n      picking of two strings simultaneously adds decidedly the usefulness of the\\n      instrument, as it increases the range of pitch as well as varying the\\n      quality of tones procurable, thereby decidedly enlarging our field of\\n      application.\\n      \\n The force used for creating the message\\n      or gymnastics of the membrana tympani and the ossicles-viz, vibratory\\n      force or sound- carefully and scientifically applied, is nature\\'s remedy,\\n      because it is adapted by nature, and is the only force which can rightly\\n      or safely be applied to these delicate portions of this complex organ of\\n      hearing.\\n      \\n A startling commentary on this subject\\n      is the array of cases benefited who have been relegated to the shelf by\\n      ancient and modern otology; cases declared unhelpable have been vastly\\n      improved. Pray, make no mistake; I did not say all cases.\\n      \\n It may be interesting to hear the\\n      latest regarding the instrument which was first invented for the\\n      application of this method of aural massage Mr. E.J. Godman, the inventor\\n      and patentee, is constantly on the lookout, and always striving for\\n      improvements to his machine. He has made many that you all know of. Permit\\n      me to report a few so recent they have not yet left the factory.\\n      \\n First.-The machine has been taken from\\n      its case, and is now mounted on a solid stand or table of oak, being set\\n      below the level, or so that the face of the instrument is just level with\\n      the face of the table. This is all supported by rigid, solid metal legs,\\n      which absolutely prevent foreign vibrations.\\n      \\n Second.-The motor has been removed from\\n      its little shelf and relegated below the table. I t can be placed upon a\\n      box on the floor, a shelf against the wall, or, better yet, a shelf\\n      solidly attached to the metal supports of the table. A belt goes up\\n      through an aperture to a wheel on a shaft, the other extremity of which\\n      carries a wheel with a rubber tire (a friction wheel), which in its\\n      revolution, being in contact with a larger flat- surfaced wheel on the\\n      main shaft of the instrument, turns this in harmony with itself. This\\n      arrangement does away with the necessity of shifting the motor each time\\n      you wish to shift the carriage from one string to another- a consummation\\n      to be devoutly thankful for. The removal of the motor from the instrument\\n      as at present attached will recommend itself to all who have used the\\n      vibrometer, a great amount of undesirable jar being thus avoided.\\n      \\n Third.-Ratchet keys capable of very\\n      fine adjustment of tension of strings are now provided for the instrument.\\n      \\n Fourth.-A rheostadt or resistance-coil\\n      is now to be placed beneath the table between the storage battery and the\\n      switch, by this means enabling us to control the speed and number of\\n      revolutions to a nicety.\\n      \\n Other, though comparatively minor,\\n      improvements are being made, and others are contemplated, as, for\\n      instance, the substitution of a roughly corrugated rubber band for the\\n      picker on the wheel, thereby getting rid of the metallic sound of the\\n      picker on the wire strings.\\n      \\n I have experimented with a number of\\n      appliance for the production of the sounds and pitches that I have\\n      required, but I always fall back on the vibrometer, especially as at\\n      present constructed, for satisfactory work and results.\\n      \\n This instrument may be, and probably\\n      is, as yet, in its infancy. It, and the method it applies, can only be\\n      perfected by constant work and experimentation both on the part of the\\n      profession and of the manufacturers. Each improvement we can suggest, if\\n      it only should serve as a means of helping one solitary case, would be\\n      well worth our while.\\n      \\n The experiments being made by different\\n      methods for treating deafness by sound waves is indicative of the interest\\n      the profession has taken in the matter. It is indicative of a lack of\\n      something in our usual armamentarium which is greatly longed for by\\n      patient and doctor; that is, the means for making the deaf hear and for\\n      relieving distressing tinnitus. There has been a dearth in this direction,\\n      and perhaps there still is, but I believe fully that we have in aural\\n      massage by vibratory force a decided acquisition at our hands.\\n      \\n E. H. LINNELL., M.D.: I would simply\\n      like to ask Dr. King how long he uses the instrument, and whether he uses\\n      it according to the deafness.\\n      \\n DR. KING: Yes, decidedly. In an intense\\n      case of deafness I would have to use it a great deal longer. The central\\n      attachment I never carry over three or five minutes, and the whole\\n      treatment I don\\'t think is over carried over twenty or twenty-five minutes\\n      in one case, and usually averages from ten to fifteen.\\n      \\n HAROLD WILSON, M.D.: I have only to\\n      suggest, what I have elsewhere called attention to, the possibility of\\n      another mechanical device for securing vibratory motion. It is well known\\n      that in the make and break of a current of electricity, in the circuit of\\n      which there is a telephone, we get an influence upon the make and break of\\n      the current in the telephone. Now, it is a simple matter with which these\\n      makes and breaks are made as to obtaining any number of vibration that you\\n      wish. You may, by a mechanical device of some rotary motion, if you\\n      choose, make and break the current as rapidly as you please until you have\\n      reached several thousand vibrations a second, or you may even make the\\n      vibrations so slow us to be easily counted. The application of this\\n      suggestion has been put in force in my own practice, more or less, in the\\n      use of the telephone as connected with the induction-coil ordinary\\n      battery. The more intense the current, the more intense the sound. You can\\n      easily see that it is mere question of mechanics to secure these two\\n      sounds-intensity of vibration and rapidity of vibration. I will say,\\n      furthermore, that it has this advantage. There is no noise in the office,\\n      which I think is not altogether true of the vibrometer. I would suggest\\n      that so far as the vibrometer is concerned, if it could be made to be\\n      noiseless to anybody but the patient, it would be a decided improvement.\\n      In that respect the telephone is a decided improvement, because there is\\n      no noise except to the patient, because the noise is right at the ear of\\n      the patient. If I were seeking for a perfected instrument in this line, I\\n      would go outside of the banjo idea. As we have the most perfect writing\\n      machines, which have no connection with the ordinary method of writing,\\n      and sewing machines, which have no connection with sewing by hand, so it\\n      occurs to me that possibly the securing of he vibratory motion upon the\\n      ears might be obtained in a totally different way from that which you get\\n      when you listen to the drum of the guitar or an ordinary musical\\n      instrument, and I would suggest that the make and break of a telephone\\n      open a very fruitful field for mechanical experimentation.\\n      \\n H.C. HOUGHTON, M.D.: In my study of\\n      this subject I made the acquaintance of Mr. Bernhardt, of New York City,\\n      who is a personal friend of Mr. Emil Berliner, the inventor of the Emil\\n      Berliner Telephone, which is the instrument by which the Bell Telephone\\n      Company maintain their monopoly at present. Mr. Berliner is the inventor\\n      of the graphophone, and has, I think, covered this whole matter which Dr.\\n      Wilson has mentioned. As ordinary Bell telephone receiver is put into the\\n      circuit of an ordinary induction machine, and you can use it just as the\\n      English people use the audiometer, and as you remove the coil you modify\\n      the vibrations, which is covered with another disk and a tube, and that\\n      tube covered with a stethoscope tube, which is the same as we use for the\\n      phonograph or vibrometer, and, as Dr. Wilson has suggested, you can modify\\n      the intensity, and of course the whole matter is adjusted by the\\n      attachment of the cord, so that you can have fine vibrations. The\\n      intensity of the vibrations is regulated by the distance to which you\\n      uncover the cord. The only difficulty in the adjustment is that it has\\n      been so severe that it is really uncomfortable, and the noise of the\\n      instrument is reduced to the minimum for office use.\\n      \\n A.B. NORTON, M.D.: I will also add that\\n      in regard to the objection Dr. Wilson makes to the noise, there is no\\n      doubt it is an annoying thing in the office, and in that line I have some\\n      men at work on my suggestion. We are devising another machine, or\\n      instrument, which is to be entirely enclosed in a cabinet, so there will\\n      be no noise whatever in the room if it is made a success. The idea is a\\n      little crude, and I am quite uncertain whether it will amount to anything\\n      or not. Then, in the line of what Dr. King was speaking in regard to Mr.\\n      Goodwin-he called, at New York, to see me last week. I made two little\\n      suggestion to him, which I think would be in line with his advancement.\\n      One is the number of the picks. The present vibrometer has four picks I\\n      suggest the experiment of trying twelve or sixteen picks, which will make\\n      a more continuous sound; it may be of some value. Then, in regard to\\n      regulating the speed of the machine: you regulate that now by a series of\\n      buttons, so as to get three different speeds. We will have a very slight,\\n      intermediate speed, and a very rapid speed. My experience with the\\n      vibrometer is especially favorable. I think the idea is in the right\\n      direction, and it is simply a matter of instrumentation.']\n",
      "Test 7 of 18 completed.[ 'Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is a water-soluble vitamin, which is needed by the body to form collagen in bones, cartilage, muscle, and blood vessels. Dietary sources of vitamin C include fruits and vegetables, particularly citrus fruits such as oranges.Severe deficiency of vitamin C causes scurvy. Although rare, scurvy results in severe symptoms and can cause death. People with scurvy are treated with vitamin C and should be under medical supervision.Many uses for vitamin C have been proposed, but evidence of benefit in scientific studies is lacking. In particular, research on asthma, cancer, and diabetes remains inconclusive, and a lack of benefit has been found for the prevention of cataracts or heart disease.The use of vitamin C in the prevention or treatment of colds remains controversial. Extensive research has been conducted. Overall, vitamin C lacked an effect on the development of colds and on cold symptoms. However, the duration of the cold shortened slightly. Notably, people living in extreme circumstances, including soldiers in the subarctic, skiers, and marathon runners, had a 50% decrease in the risk of developing a cold. This area merits additional research and may be of particular interest to athletes or people in the military.'\n",
      " \"Honey is a sweet fluid made by honeybees from the nectar of flowers. It is generally safe, but there have been reports of certain toxic types of honey made from plants from the Rhododendron genus and others.Honey is easy for the body to absorb and use. It contains about 70-80 percent sugar. The rest is water, minerals, and some protein, acids, and other substances. Honey has been used for wounds, skin problems, and various diseases of the stomach and intestines.The antibacterial effects of honey are well-known. Research has been done on the role of honey in long-term wound management, as well as the treatment of ulcers, burns, Fournier's gangrene (a life-threatening bacterial infection), and diabetes. However, more high-quality studies are needed to make firm conclusions on the use of honey.\"\n",
      " 'Vitamin B12 is an essential water-soluble vitamin that is commonly found in a variety of foods, such as fish, shellfish, meat, eggs, and dairy products. Vitamin B12 is frequently used in combination with other B vitamins in a vitamin B complex formulation. Vitamin B12 is important in DNA synthesis. Vitamin B12 is bound to the protein in food. Acid in the stomach releases B12 from protein during digestion. Once released, B12 combines with a substance called intrinsic factor (IF) before it is absorbed into the bloodstream.The human body stores several years\\' worth of vitamin B12 in the liver, so low levels in the body are rare. Decreases in vitamin B12 levels are more common in the elderly, HIV-infected persons, and vegetarians. Inability to absorb vitamin B12 from the intestinal tract can cause a type of anemia called pernicious anemia. Fever and symptoms of \"excessive sweating\" have been reported with anemia due to low levels of vitamin B12; however, these are fixed with vitamin B12 treatment.'\n",

Tea tree oil is thought to have antiseptic properties and has been used to prevent and treat infections.Other traditional uses of tea tree oil include treatment of fungal infections (including fungal infections of the nails and athlete's foot), dental health, parasites, skin allergic reactions, and vaginal infections. In addition, there is evidence supporting tea tree oil use for acne; however, further research is needed.Tea tree oil should not be taken by mouth; there are reports of toxicity after consuming tea tree oil by mouth. When applied to the skin, tea tree oil is reported to be mildly irritating and has been associated with the development of an allergic skin reaction, which may limit its potential as an agent for the skin in some people.\"\n",
      " 'Melatonin is a hormone produced in the brain by the pineal gland from the amino acid tryptophan. The production and release of melatonin are stimulated by darkness and decreased by light, suggesting that melatonin is involved in circadian rhythm (the internal body clock) and regulation of diverse body functions. Levels of melatonin in the blood are highest prior to bedtime.The most common use of melatonin is to aid in sleep. The strongest evidence supporting the use of melatonin is for delayed sleep phase syndrome, insomnia in children and the elderly, jet lag, and sleep problems in people with behavioral, developmental, or mental disorders. The weakest evidence in support of melatonin is for work shift sleep disorder. Good evidence in support of melatonin for other uses is lacking.New drugs that block the effects of melatonin are being developed. These include BMS-214778 and luzindole, and they may have uses in various disorders.'\n",
      " 'Black cohosh is popular as an alternative to hormonal therapy in the treatment of menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes, mood disturbances, excessive sweating, palpitations, and vaginal dryness. Several studies have reported black cohosh may improve menopausal symptoms for up to one year, although the evidence is mixed.The mechanism of action of black cohosh remains unclear. Research suggests that there may be no direct effects on estrogen receptors, although this is an area of active controversy.Safety and efficacy beyond one year have not been proven. Reports suggest the safety of short-term use, including in women with menopausal symptoms for whom estrogen replacement therapy is not suggested. Nonetheless, caution is advised until better-quality safety data are available. There have been reports of liver damage and higher lead levels in the blood from black cohosh. Use of black cohosh in high-risk populations (such as in women with a history of breast cancer) should be under the supervision of a licensed healthcare professional.'\n",
      " 'Beta-carotene is a carotenoid. Carotenoids are red, orange, or yellow, fat-soluble compounds. These compounds are naturally present in many fruits, grains, oils, and vegetables. Alpha, beta, and gamma carotene are considered provitamins because they can be converted to active vitamin A.Commercially available beta-carotene is man-made or taken from palm oil, algae, or fungi. Beta-carotene is converted to retinol, which is essential for vision and growth.Studies in humans show that beta-carotene has promising use for oral leukoplakia (pre-cancerous mouth lesions) and for sunburn. However there was a lack of benefit for sun damaged skin, mole prevention, heart disease risk, infection with H. Pylori, cataract prevention, diabetes, and stroke.Research shows that beta-carotene increased the risk of bladder, lung, stomach, and prostate cancer. Also the general incidence of cancer in asbestos workers, smokers, or high risk individuals increased. Additionally, some research suggested increased risk of heart disease and death with beta-carotene supplementation.'\n",
      " 'L-arginine was first isolated in 1886, reportedly from the extract of a lupine (Lupinus spp.) seedling. Lupinus is a genus in the legume (Fabaceae) plant family.Arginine is an amino acid normally made by the body. Arginine is also found in many foods that have protein.Arginine becomes nitric oxide (a blood vessel-widening agent called a vasodilator) in the body. Early evidence suggests that arginine may help treat medical conditions that improve with increased vasodilation. These conditions include chest pain, atherosclerosis (clogged arteries), heart disease, heart failure, erectile dysfunction, peripheral vascular disease, and headaches from blood vessel swelling).Arginine also triggers the body to make protein and has been studied for healing wounds, bodybuilding, enhancing sperm production, and preventing tissue wasting in people with critical illnesses. However, caution is warranted. Arginine use was associated with death in some people with heart conditions. Caution is also needed when using arginine to treat pre-eclampsia (high blood pressure in pregnancy).Arginine hydrochloride has been used to treat metabolic alkalosis. This use should be under the supervision of a qualified healthcare professional.'\n",

The lignan components of flaxseed (not flaxseed oil) may possess antioxidant properties and alter estrogen activity.As a source of fiber, flaxseed (not flaxseed oil) has laxative properties. In large doses, or when taken without enough water, flaxseed may cause bowel obstruction. The effects of flaxseed on blood sugar levels are unclear.Flaxseed oil contains only the ALA component of flaxseed and not the fiber or lignan components.

      " 'Tresorie - The Present Status of Radiation in the Treatment of Malignant\\nConditions [Present Status Of Radiation in the Treatment Of Malignant\\nConditions]\\n ISIDORE ARONS, M.D.\\n      \\n New York, N.Y.\\n      \\n AT A meeting of the American Medical\\n      Association recently held in Cleveland, Dr. Joseph C.Bloodgood, in\\n      discussing a paper on radiation therapy, said that \"report at my\\n      clinic told me that 49 per cent of the patients previously operated on in\\n      the clinic now to for radiotherapy. This is based on results. They are not\\n      hopeless cases; they are still hopeful and they get well under\\n      radiotherapy. This has happened during the last three years, not because I\\n      have changed any but because the method of radiotherapy has changed. A\\n      great change has taken place. First of all, radium and x-rays are no\\n      longer looked on a last resort.\".\\n      \\n The foregoing bears witness to the\\n      progress made in the field radiation therapy. The manufacture of more\\n      adequate apparatus and the improved technic in its use reflect this\\n      improvement. Machines are used generally delivering twenty to thirty\\n      milliamperes of current at 200 K.V., while machines operating at 750 to\\n      1,000 200 K.V., using lower milliamperes, have been installed in several\\n      places in this country. Since the question of increased voltages began to\\n      dominate the field, machines operating at 400 to 600 K.V., using sealed\\n      tubes, have been manufactured in this country as well as on the been\\n      manufactured in this country as well as on the continent. This higher\\n      powered machines occupy little more space than the usual 200 K.V. machine.\\n      \\n The effectiveness of these stronger\\n      radiations is thought to be due to (1) the increased penetration and its\\n      consequently larger percentage depth doses, (2) the supposed higher\\n      selective action of short have length radiation on malignant cells, and\\n      (3) greatly increased x-ray output. Clinics using super-voltages report\\n      that clinical results are somewhat better than those secured through the\\n      use of the lesser voltage machine.\\n      \\n Experimental effort, from the physical\\n      and biologic point of view, has been exerted to establish to standard\\n      basis for radiotherapy since Roentgens discovery thirtyfive years ago, and\\n      its application five years later. Radiotherapists have only recently begun\\n      to understand the principles of clinical application or radiotherapy in\\n      the treatment of malignant conditions.\\n      \\n Regaud selected the rabbits testicle\\n      for his experiments because its histologic cellular structure was highly\\n      sensitive to radiation, containing cells which are in a state of active\\n      mitosis resembling that of malignant tissue. In 1922, Regaud reported that\\n      of malignant, tissue. In 1922, Regaud reported that it was impossible to\\n      sterilize the testicle by a single dose of radiation without causing\\n      serious damage to the overlying skin. The dose required to produced such\\n      radio necrosis was equivalent to about three radionecrosis was equivalent\\n      to about three erythemas when administered in one dose. However, by\\n      dividing the dose in such a manner as to prolong the treatment over a\\n      period of fourteen days, a total dose of about five erythemas could be\\n      given causing complete sterilizations without damage to the skin. Thus it\\n      is seen that by prolonging the time of treatment the cutaneous dose could\\n      be increased nearly 50 per cent without causing necrosis.\\n      \\n The above experiments were reported,\\n      and the same results determined, by Schinz and Slotopolsky in 1926, and\\n      again by Regaud and Ferroux in 1927. These experiments formed the\\n      foundation for the clinical studies of Pfahler (America), Hohlfelder\\n      (Germany) and Coutard (France), who have swung the pendulum from massive\\n      radiation, as advocated by the German school, to that of the protected\\n      fractional dose method. Results have been achieved by this method which\\n      are superior to previously reported; these are obtained by the improved\\n      method of administering a large dose to the (3 days) without causing\\n      destructive effects to the surroundings normal structure (or cancer bed);\\n      its effect are rather biologic than physical. The clinical application of\\n      the method of radiation by Pfahler, Countard, and Berven (Sweden) in the\\n      treatment of cancer of the tonsil, pharynx and larynx and have proved the\\n      radio-sensitive properties of squamous carcinoma, previously considered\\n      incapable of of responding to radiation.\\n      \\n According to Coutard, the neoplasm is\\n      exposed to x-rays twice daily, giving a total dose of 350 r to400 r to two\\n      areas, using 190 to 200 k.v., four milliamperes, two millimeters of copper\\n      and three millimeters of aluminum filtration at a distance of fifty of\\n      sixty centimeters, for lesion of the head and neck. For deeply situated\\n      lesions, such as cancer of the uterus, the focal distance varies from 80\\n      to 100 centimeters, the area of the field for the head and neck conditions\\n      being only 50 to 100 square centimeters, while those of the lower abdomen\\n      require on an average of 250 to 300 square centimeters. For the\\n      sterilization of the radio-sensitive squamous carcinomatous growth, a\\n      depth dose of 3,000 r to 4,000 r is given, while stronger dose is\\n      necessary for the radio-resistant tumors.\\n      \\n In the course of treatment of principle\\n      guides a radio reaction of the covering epithelium and the radio reaction\\n      of the cancer cells. The radio reaction of the cutaneous epithelium is\\n      called \"radio epidermitis.\"characterized by loss of epithelial\\n      layers and denudation of the dermis. The reaction of the mucous membrane ,\\n      called \"radio epithelitis,\" manifests itself by loss of the\\n      epithelial layer sand denudation of the mucous membrane, epithelial layers\\n      and denudation of the corium which becomes covered by a fibrinous and\\n      false membrane; of clear. The duration of both describe radio reactions is\\n      six weeks. Each appears at the beginning of three weeks and disappears at\\n      the beginning of the ninth week.\\n      \\n Should the total or daily dose or the\\n      intensity per minute be too high, or the filtration or the tension too\\n      low, the cancer bed would be modified. the nutrition of the malignant\\n      cells becomes impaired The cellular radio- sensitivity, which seems to be\\n      linked up not only with the mitosis of the cell but above all with the\\n      activity of their interchange with the cell but above all with the\\n      activity of their interchange with the surrounding normal structures,\\n      becomes diminished and at times suppressed. The cancer cells become\\n      incentive to radiation. This phenomenon is called \"radio-\\n      vaccination\" by Regaud.\\n      \\n Observation of clinical facts shows\\n      that changes in the surrounding normal tissue result from excessive daily\\n      doses and intensity per minute per minute causing radio resistance of the\\n      tissue. Conversely, radio- sensitivity would be prolonged with a smaller\\n      daily dosage and the resultant extended period.\\n      \\n Realizing that better results may be\\n      obtained by prolonged treatment, Coutard and his collaborators in the last\\n      few years have begun to extend the duration of treatment of certain\\n      so-called radio-resistant cancers from thirty to ninety days, giving weak\\n      daily doses in order of about 175, 220, 225 and 250 r per day, dividing\\n      the dose in two treatments. By this method he was able to cure a certain\\n      number of lesions on which he had not been able previously to obtain the\\n      same results, such as very differentiated epidermoid epithelioma invading\\n      the muscles and cartilages, glandular epithelioma of the breast ad the\\n      thyroid body, and special round celled epitheliomas of the upper part of\\n      the ethmoid and the adjacent sinuses. This mode of prolonged treatment not\\n      only controlled the condition locally but it lessened the frequency of\\n      metastasis.\\n      \\n When radiating a cancer of very\\n      embryonic, very radio-sensitive growths, the energy factor is predominant.\\n      The action of the x-rays seems to be direct and rapid; the treatment can\\n      be accomplished within fifteen to twenty days. The cells are destroyed and\\n      generally normal structures are affected very little. When radiating the\\n      less embryonic type of growths, the time of treatment should be longer.\\n      \\n Pursuing these general principles, I\\n      have adopted the Countard method with some slight modifications. The cures\\n      which I shall illustrate will show that the percentage of cures in a\\n      number of most dangerous epidermoid carcinomas has markedly increased and\\n      that some conditions formerly considered hopeless have been temporarily\\n      cured. In conclusion I wish to emphasize the following facts:.\\n      \\n (1) Cure of cancer by x-rays is still\\n      difficult and must not be entered into lightly and causally.\\n      \\n (2) Radiotherapy is just as radical in\\n      method as surgery, and requires great skill, judgment and experience.\\n      \\n (3) The cooperation of the pathologist\\n      and the radiotherapist is imperative for a proper estimate of the\\n      radio-sensitivity in relation to treatment of the lesion.\\n      \\n (4) Daily examination of the patient is\\n      necessary; modification of the normal structure and general reaction by\\n      the x-ray treatment sometimes appears to quickly that it is often\\n      necessary to diminish the daily dose or the size of the field in the\\n      course of treatment.\\n      \\n (5) There exists no fixed method of\\n      treatment, only a simple clinical treatment for each individual patient\\n      and for the special type of tumor..\\n      \\n (6) Improvement in roentgen apparatus\\n      of higher voltages, producing more penetrating rays, will permit a better\\n      relation between destruction of malignant cells and preservation of the\\n      supporting, and the radio sensitivity of the tumor may be prolonged.'\n",

This is the city where\\n      Homoeopathy was first introduced by Rajendra Lal Dutta of hallowed memory,\\n      who spent a princely fortune for dissemination of its principles and\\n      practice among his countrymen. This is the city where took place the\\n      dramatic conversion of one of the then medical luminaries of the first\\n      magnitude, to the practice of Homoeopathy under the influence of Rajendra\\n      Lal. I mean Dr. Mahendra Lal Sircar who became the high priest of\\n      Homoeopathy, spread its glory far and wide and gained thereby an\\n      international reputation for himself. This is the city where the\\n      celebrities of Homoeopathy like Dr. Berigny, Dr. Salzar, Dr. P.C.\\n      Majumdar, Dr. D. N. Roy. Dr. Younan, Dr. J.N. Majumdar, Dr. Baridbaran\\n      Mukherji, Dr. S.K. Nag, Dr. A.N. Mukherji, Dr. T.N. Palit, Dr. G.\\n      Dirghangi and a host of other talented physicians practised their\\n      profession with credit and success and held aloft the banner of\\n      Homoeopathy. This is the city where exist pioneer institutions for the\\n      teaching of Homoeopathy. This is the city wherefrom Homoeopathy has spread\\n      to all parts of India and its votaries are doing yeomans service for the\\n      good of the suffering humanity.\\n      \\n We are meeting this evening on a\\n      historic occasion and we have to arrive at decisions which might make or\\n      mar the future history of Homoeopathy in India. It may be that forces of\\n      disruption, destruction and obstruction are at work; it may be that self\\n      and vested interests seem to thwart the smooth progress of Homoeopathy; it\\n      may be that some may seem to play in the hands of the Powers that are not\\n      too sympathetic to the cause of Homoeopathy; it may be that the present\\n      seems to be chaotic and future of Homoeopathy dubious but great is truth\\n      indeed and will prevail. We should not lose heart or throw up the sponge.\\n      Tradition, authority, sectarianism, dogmatism are great obstacles on the\\n      way. But obstacles and difficulties are meant to be fought out and\\n      overcome. Strifes and dissensions, discords and disunities may hamper our\\n      progress but they are nonetheless signs of lifes activities. It is a good\\n      augury that the Homoeopathic profession is shaking off its age - long\\n      slumber and getting more and more conscious of its duties and obligation,\\n      its rights and privileges and of its short - comings and practical\\n      difficulties. The life of Hahnemann is there to encourage us; the\\n      masterful will of his dynamic spirit is there to inspire us to intensify\\n      our activities; his achievements are there to goad us to realise greater\\n      success; and his personality is always before us to take lessons from, in\\n      our life which as Swami Vivekananda puts it, is \"a process of\\n      unfolding and development of a being under circumstances tending to press\\n      it down.\"\\n      \\n That Homoeopathy is a scientific system\\n      of treatment, philosophically sound, logically unimpeachable, practically\\n      highly efficacious in curing the sick and cheap enough to suit the poor\\n      economic condition of the Indian masses - has become a much talked - of\\n      subject in the country. But why is it not spreading sufficiently and\\n      adequately in our motherland or in fact anywhere in the world? Why is our\\n      National Government not still keen on according official recognition to\\n      this superb system of healing art or providing ways and means for its\\n      development and diffusion? Why the public opinion is not gaining strength\\n      enough to put sufficient pressure on our Government to take interest in\\n      it? Why sufficient number of fully equipped Homoeopathic teaching\\n      institutions and hospitals are not growing to turn out adequate number of\\n      fully qualified Homoeopathic physicians in the country?\\n      \\n It is high time that we should draw the\\n      attention of the profession and the laity to provide answers to so many\\n      \"whys\" and to solve the pressing problems in the matter\\n      concerned. On a cursory view it becomes evident that the Homoeopathic\\n      profession, the people and the Government are each individually and\\n      collectively responsible for this impasse.\\n      \\n The so - called Allopathy still\\n      occupies the dominant place in any country, even in the land of birth of\\n      Homoeopathy. It is no wonder that Homoeopathy, being a discovery of merely\\n      a century and a half still lags behind its rival shool. But it is a wonder\\n      of wonders that Homoeopathy has already encompassed the whole world within\\n      such a short period since it was ushered into existence by Hahnemann.\\n      History of man reveals that nowhere a new truth was accepted by him easily\\n      and readily, obsessed as he is with conservatism, tradition, authority and\\n      vested interests. Nonetheless the triumphant march of Homoeopathy with a\\n      such a meteoric speed throughout the length and breadth of the world is a\\n      proof positive of the truth inherent in the system and phenomenal\\n      therapeutic efficacy of this healing art. It is one more glaring instance\\n      of mans love of truth against heavy odds that impede his progress at every\\n      step.\\n      \\n For the propagation of any new truth\\n      and its acceptance by man, in general, the first and foremost condition is\\n      the turning out of sufficient number of persons who have realised the\\n      truth and are adept in the practice of it. This involves establishment of\\n      a sufficient number of teaching institutions which will turn out experts\\n      in the science and art of Homoeopathy; and a sufficient number of\\n      Homoeopathic Hospital where, the efficacy of this system of treatment will\\n      be put to test.\\n      \\n Human knowledge is becoming\\n      unmanageably vast. The appearance of specialists has become indispensable.\\n      So special Hospitals for the treatment of specific types of diseases have\\n      sprung forth elsewhere, e.g. Tuberculosis Hospitals, Cancer Hospitals,\\n      Hospital for Tropical Diseases etc. Because of organisation of these\\n      hospitals people generally think of getting themselves treated in these\\n      institutions. As there are no fully - equipped general Homoeopathic\\n      Hospitals and not to speak of special Homoeopathic Hospitals and not to\\n      speak of special Homoeopathic Hospitals the result is Homoeopathy is not\\n      getting a fair chance of treating those diseases like tuberculosis,\\n      cancer, acute infectious diseases of epidemic type e.g., Small-pox,\\n      Cholera etc. on a large and organised scale. Consequently the general\\n      public cannot keep much faith in this treatment and mostly take recourse\\n      to homoeopathic treatment when the case is \"past all hope and past\\n      all surgery\". Hence the establishment of fully - equipped\\n      Homoeopathic institutions (College - cum - Hospitals) is an imperative\\n      necessity for enhancing the prestige of the Homoeopathic profession and\\n      for convincing the people about the therapeutic efficacy of this system of\\n      treatment. Is it not a pity that Homoeopathy once established its\\n      reputation by treating Cholera cases in this city and now nobody thinks of\\n      this treatment in Cholera cases and rushes the patient to the Allopathic\\n      Hospitals which are especially meant for these types of patients? How can\\n      we hope to gain ground under these circumstances?\\n      \\n The next great obstacle is the apathy\\n      and in many cases active antagonism of our Government, both at the Centre\\n      and at least in some of the State, towards Homoeopathy. The Government is\\n      under the thumb of its medical directorates which are solely manned by\\n      Allopathic doctors. The main reasons for the non - acceptance of the\\n      Homoeopathic system of treatment may be summed up in three words:\\n      tradition, authority and professionalism. Their psychology is easily\\n      understood if it is borne in mind that the conservative inertia of human\\n      mind attempts to reject any new thought will all the means at its\\n      disposal. Another reason is due to vested interests. Even a cursory glance\\n      at the history of origin and spread of Homoeopathy, enables one to find\\n      out that the opposition to this system from the start, was not scientific\\n      but rather of commercial nature on the part of the apothecaries who were\\n      afraid of losing their trade - profits. We regret to note that the Central\\n      Government have not yet implemented a single recommendation put forward by\\n      the Homoeopathic Enquiry Committee, Planning Commission. Third Health\\n      Ministers Conference, Ad Hoc Committee etc. though Homoeopathic Acts have\\n      been passed in the States of Bombay, U.P., Madhya Pradesh, Travancore -\\n      Cochin, Bihar etc. I is curious to note that W. Bengal is the only State\\n      where a Homoeopathic Bill has recently been thrown out by the State\\n      Government.\\n      \\n Another great obstacle is the\\n      psychology of the general mass of population who fail to adopt a proper\\n      philosophical attitude towards Homoeopathy and takes the Homoeopathic\\n      Therapeutic Law as great paradox contrary to common sense. Unless we can\\n      educate the public in the matter, we cannot hope to secure their whole -\\n      hearted support for this system of treatment.\\n      \\n Lack of enthusiasm for constructive\\n      works on the part of the Homoeopathic profession, the apathy of our\\n      Government and hesitancy on the part of the public to accept Homoeopathy\\n      are great obstacles to the spread of this system of treatment in the\\n      country. Unless this vicious circles is broken the progress of Homoeopathy\\n      is bound to be impeded. We have to fight on all fronts if we aspire to\\n      achieve victory in our battle for the cause of Homoeopathy and the\\n      suffering humanity.\\n      \\n But our first necessity as pointed out\\n      by the Soul of India expressing itself through Sri Aurobindo, is: If India\\n      is to survive and do her appointed work in the world, the youth of India\\n      should learn to think, to think on all subjects, to think independently,\\n      fruitfully, going to the heart of things, not stopped by their surface,\\n      free of pre - judgements, shearing sophism and prejudice asunder as with a\\n      sharp sword smiting down obscurantism of all kinds as with a mace of\\n      Bhima.\\n      \\n \"Let our brains no longer, like\\n      European infants, be swathed with swaddling clothes; let it have recover\\n      the free and unbound motion of the Gods, let it have not only the\\n      minuteness but the wide mastery and sovereignty natural to the intellect\\n      of Bharata and easily recoverable by it if it once accustomes itself to\\n      feel its own power and be convinced of its own worth.\\n      \\n \"The old fixed foundations have\\n      been broken up, we are tossing in the waters of a great upheaval and\\n      change. It is no use clinging to the old ice - floes of the past, they\\n      will soon melt and leave their refugees struggling in perilous waters. It\\n      is no use landing ourselves in the infirm bog, neither sea nor good, dry\\n      land of a second - hand Europeanism. We shall only die there a miserable\\n      and unclean death.\\n      \\n \"No we must learn to swim and use\\n      that power to reach the good vessel of unchanging truth; we must land\\n      again on the eternal rock of ages.\"\\n      \\n Yes, we must expand, we must assimilate\\n      whatever is assimilable for our growth. Stagnation and contraction are the\\n      signs of Death. Our knowledge must be aggressive, must diffuse through the\\n      rank and file of the whole Homoeopathic profession if we wish to survive\\n      and perpetuate ourselves; to leave an extensive ignorance either below or\\n      around us is to expose ourselves to the perpetual danger of being\\n      exterminated as a professional entity.\\n      \\n In fine, I welcome you, once again, on\\n      this historic occasion to this historic city to deliberate, to exchange\\n      view points and to come to agreed decisions with regard to our future line\\n      of action in respect of Homoeopathy in all its aspects.'\n",
      " 'Tresorie - SOME OBSERVATIONS ON NEURASTHENIA AND ITS TREATMENT\\n[Neurasthenia & Treatment]\\n\\n WHEN, thirty-five years ago, the writer\\n      first made the acquaintance of what is now called neurasthenia, it was\\n      known as spinal irritation, and the best of modern researches have been\\n      unable to give a better definition beyond a functional disturbance of the\\n      spinal and cerebral nerves, dependent on a morbid process, for which\\n      \"irritation\" is as proper a term as any. As deaths do not occur,\\n      autopsies throw no light on the subject. Briefly stated, neurasthenia,\\n      when observed from the beginning through its chronic course, has a period\\n      of prodromal symptoms followed by a protracted acute, and succeeded by a\\n      still more protracted chronic, state, between the end of which and the\\n      beginning of convalescence there is a very vague, often indiscernible,\\n      boundary line.\\n      \\n The prodromal symptoms are quite\\n      indefinite and very variable, pointing to nothing in particular. Loss of\\n      appetite, irregular sleep, excitability alternating with lassitude, etc.,\\n      are often overlooked, especially when the second stage-display of unusual\\n      mental and physical energy without subsequent fatigue- becomes apparent.\\n      This is often mistaken for a sign of unusually good health. When a young\\n      girl or mature woman, married or unmarried, feels that she can study ten\\n      hours a day and devote half of her night to pleasure or business; when\\n      besides much mental occupation she begins to rejoice in long walks without\\n      fatigue, that is the time when the mischief is going on without exciting\\n      timely suspicion. Relief is at last sought when the functional disorder of\\n      the nerves has gone to the opposite extreme, and becomes manifest in what\\n      is properly and popularly termed \"nervous prostration,\" when\\n      instead of having no sense of fatigue, the best bodily or mental effort\\n      seems intolerable, in grave cases rendering the patient a helpless being,\\n      completely dependent on the unremitting assistance of others whom she )it\\n      is usually a woman) rules with the inexorable power of the vis inertiae.\\n      \\n During this usually very protracted\\n      period of the disease convalescence usually sets in, but so imperceptibly\\n      that the physician alone can sometimes estimate its progress, which is\\n      unnoticeable to others towards whom the patient acts as she has for months\\n      or years. This is the time for action, too often delayed from motives of\\n      misplaced sympathy on the part of relatives and friends.\\n      \\n The affections is in many instances\\n      limited to the spine, the mind becoming only secondarily tired. In other\\n      cases it is spinal and cerebral; in others again chiefly cerebral. The\\n      line between this and insanity is always clearly definable. Though a\\n      neurasthenic patient may become insane, and probably the reverse, yet both\\n      are distinct conditions.\\n      \\n Books speak of this disease at common\\n      to men and women. Yet in this region in small towns as well as in large\\n      cities the cases of neurasthenia in women are preponderatingly great.\\n      \\n Hypochondriacs and hysteria stand in\\n      peculiar relation to neurasthenia. They maybe regarded as different\\n      species of the same genus; that is, more or less deeply seated\\n      disturbances of the cerebro-spinal system in which the sympathetic system\\n      is probably indirectly involved, as many functional disturbances presided\\n      over by the great sympathetic system often testify. Hypochondriasis, pure\\n      and simple as occurring in men, is easily distinguishable by its striking\\n      characteristic of introspection and despondency, occasioned by abnormal\\n      sensations, without marked physical weakness and tiredness. Pure\\n      hypochondriacs are often energetic, conscientious workers. In hysteria\\n      there is neither great tiredness nor tendency to introspection, but a\\n      paroxysmal or prolonged absence of the power of self control, in grave\\n      cases associated with tonic or clonic muscular spasm and loss of\\n      consciousness. While neurasthenia in its uncomplicated forms is free from\\n      these symptoms, but, as ample experience teaches, often complicated with\\n      both of the preceding forms to such an extent that it is often very\\n      difficult to tell which is primary and which secondary. The symptoms known\\n      as introspection, hysterical aberrations of the emotions, and neurasthenic\\n      sense of exhaustion are in their distinctive manifestations most important\\n      and constitute indications in the selection of remedial and dietetic\\n      measures.\\n      \\n The following are some observation of\\n      peculiarities observed in a large number of cases and peculiar to all:.\\n      \\n Introspection.-The neurasthenic patient\\n      in variably expresses her desire for relief, not so much in a direct\\n      appeal as in a supplicating, subdued tone of voice and manner. She rarely\\n      asks, \"What can you do to relieve me?\" but almost invariably,\\n      \"What is the cause of\" this or that sensation? If she is\\n      introspective, that is, hypochondriacal, she becomes a nosomaniac,\\n      watching acutely every one of her numerous distressing sensation, on the\\n      unremitting analysis of which her mind dwells. In marked cases she is\\n      quite unable to think of anything outside of herself, and in many cases\\n      dislikes to do so, preferring to river her attention on herself. Attempts\\n      to divert her annoy or anger her. Friends and relatives implore the\\n      physician to divert the patient, but all their attempts are in vain\\n      because quite misdirected.\\n      \\n Positive and Negative Will.-It seems\\n      sometimes as if the patient delights in her self-inspection, and that she\\n      prefers her condition to speedy recovery. This is not the case, for the\\n      patient will always assure the physician of her wish to get well. During\\n      the acute stage-a long yet definable period-this wish and longing cannot\\n      well be utilized, but the long and ill-defined period of convalescence\\n      must first be awaited. Here we shall always discover that the wish and the\\n      will of the patient are two very different mental conditions. The desire\\n      or wish for recovery is entirely unattended by any will effort to\\n      accomplish the desired end. The injunctions and directions of the\\n      physician are resisted by the same unconquerable power of negative power,\\n      or vis inertiae. The patient having been unable to exert her will, now\\n      thinks herself unable to use it.\\n      \\n Numerous Symptoms of Patients.-To\\n      physicians in search of indications for medicines each statement of\\n      patient concerning a sensation is apt to be considered as a symptom. Many\\n      years ago, when resolved to get at the keynote of a patient\\'s case, the\\n      writer determined to allow the patient to detail all her symptoms as long\\n      as she chose and to take accurate notes of each one till the right one\\n      should be disclosed; and this was to be done regardless of time and\\n      exertion. The patient, one who needed no urging to describe her\\n      \"symptoms,\" began in an almost inaudible voice, detailing one\\n      sensation after another with an unrivalled degree of clearness and\\n      vividness of expression; as she proceeded the voice became stronger, her\\n      face slightly flushed, and the most perfect descriptive language flowed in\\n      an endless stream. Each word was written down, page after page was filled;\\n      still she went on with unmistakable signs of satisfaction at being able to\\n      pour her pent-up emotions into willing and sympathetic ears. If, for a\\n      moment, the flow of language was interrupted, a simple question would\\n      re-animate her to proceed with renewed energy. Feelings seemed to beget\\n      feelings; their complexity gave the patient no trouble; her intellect was\\n      equal to the action of unraveling the most complicated sensation,\\n      separating them into their component parts and spreading them out before\\n      the mind of the listener. A glance at the watch showed that nearly two\\n      hours had passed, during which the feeblest of neurasthenic patients had\\n      talked incessantly. The note-book was full, the keynote was found. It was\\n      this: neurasthenic patients have innumerable sensation and exhibit no\\n      sings of fatigue after talking incessantly for nearly two hours.\\n      \\n Great Endurance of Neurasthenics.-The\\n      instance just related, which is one of many, illustrates two things. One\\n      is, that it is not the kind of sensation described but the fact that\\n      neurasthenics have innumerable sensations, that constitute the symptoms.\\n      The other thing is that many neurasthenics are capable of great exertion\\n      without suffering disagreeable after- effects from fatigue. This is\\n      illustrated by other cases of which I have notes. A highly neurasthenic\\n      young lady consented to camp out for her health near a lake. She was\\n      induced to join a party for a short walk along the lake. By trying what\\n      they thought a shorter road the party lost their way and took a very long\\n      walk of about four hours, through bogs and over forces. The neurasthenic\\n      was less fatigued than some of the others. The interesting observation was\\n      subsequently made that the patient had become interested in a young man of\\n      the party. She recovered her health within a year from that time. Other\\n      cases of this kind will appear under the head of therapeutic suggestions.\\n      \\n Neurasthenic Patients Crave\\n      Sympathy.-This is one of the most formidable obstacles to the curative\\n      management of such cases, for the kind of sympathy such patients crave is\\n      expressions of condolence and more or less deep affliction at so much\\n      suffering as the patient expresses. Such sympathy is most natural and does\\n      honor to the feelings of parents, sisters, brothers and husbands, but it\\n      is unfortunate that the deeper their expression of affliction so much the\\n      more profound will be the mental dejection and weakness of the patient.\\n      Almost every case which has come under the writer\\'s observation has been\\n      much hampered if not made hopeless by this condition of things, against\\n      which no remedy suggests itself that would not be construed as\\n      \"unkind\".\\n      \\n The origin of this very formidable and\\n      refractory nervous disease, like that of most diseases usually termed\\n      chronic, is either hereditary or acquired, as the histories of every\\n      observed case plainly testify. Either the father was a hypochondriac or\\n      the mother neurasthenic, or both parents were of unsound nervous\\n      constitution. Dipsomania on the part of parents produces neurasthenia in\\n      the children, as readily as it will be followed by any other form of\\n      nervous disease, according to the individual predisposition of the\\n      offspring. The excessive use of tea and coffee is another very active\\n      factor in the history of neurasthenics. Where fathers inclined to alcohol,\\n      mothers are addicted to tea and coffee, which, while its immediate effects\\n      do not obtrude themselves upon our notice, are none the less insidious in\\n      their more remote consequences.\\n      \\n The acquired forms of neurasthenia are\\n      of utmost interest to the therapeutist, and the sources of acquisition are\\n      readily stated. They are much brain-work with insufficient food and sleep.\\n      Such conditions obtain chiefly in women (less frequently in men) of fine\\n      intellectual ability, conscientiousness and ambition. Physical overwork\\n      with unintellectual women has no such effect. Quite analogous to the above\\n      are the conditions of care and sorrow, especially in women who are able\\n      for a long time to conceal and control their emotions. The usual\\n      consequence of such states of mind is disregard of food and insufficient\\n      sleep. Instances of acquired neurasthenia are presented in families of\\n      several girls and boys, where one or more of the former are Neurasthenic\\n      while the latter are vigorous and athletic. Boys delighting in vigorous\\n      exercise do not, as is the case with girls, lose appetite and sleep.\\n      \\n The effects of nervous exhaustion in\\n      boys are usually much less grave than in girls; as a rule such effects are\\n      manifested in mental, not muscular, tiredness, and they are relieved by\\n      air and exercise, while in girls and women those influences are shunned\\n      because they seem to increase the tiredness.\\n      \\n Predisposition-The temperament, or what\\n      in modern pharaseology is called the personal equation, plays a visible\\n      but uncontrollable part in the progress of neurasthenia, as temperament\\n      greatly determines the other imperfectly known condition known as\\n      predisposition. Where the disease is hereditary, it is easy to say that\\n      the predisposition is due to that source; where there is no history of\\n      heredity and where neurasthenia exists in the last members of a\\n      generation, it may be attributed to acquired predisposition which needed\\n      only the exciting cause to establish the disease in its most typical form.\\n      \\n One of the most common forms of\\n      neurasthenia, often quite intractable, results from a serious defect in\\n      our public school system, one which affects chiefly girls from twelve to\\n      fourteen years of age. The following is a brief example: The child rises\\n      late with no appetite for breakfast and no time to eat it if so inclined.\\n      The lessons, however, have been learned the evening before, and the school\\n      work is begun with an ambitions will and a crammed mind, and continues\\n      with one intermission of often not more than ten minutes or three of four\\n      hours. The pupil arrives at home ravenously hungry, eats too fast, and too\\n      much of injudiciously prepared food, too long in digesting to leave room\\n      for an appetite for even a light evening meal, or even for a breakfast the\\n      next morning.\\n      \\n In another case the girl or boy grows\\n      desperately hungry while at school, but being unprovided with food\\n      (lunch), goes on with the school exercises, at the end of which the sense\\n      of hunger has vanished and has been replaced by an aversion to normal\\n      food, with a possible craving for something pungent and indigestible. This\\n      observation can easily be made in many instances, and will, in as many\\n      cases, be seen to lead to nervous prostration, which is then treated by\\n      vile, patented concoctions consisting largely of whiskey, under the name\\n      of \"tonics,\" while the patient needs only the best that a\\n      legitimate market affords prepared in a sensible manner.\\n      \\n Typical Cases Ending in Rapid\\n      Recovery.-Curative results have already been indicated in what has been\\n      said above, and further indications for treatment may be gathered from a\\n      few cases of extremely rapid recovery of apparently incurable cases, to\\n      which brief allusion will here be made. A woman of forty had been a victim\\n      of grave neurasthenia for five years. In the absence of an inclination to\\n      exert himself, she had, during that period, been mostly confined to her\\n      bed or lounge, in the meantime giving birth to two children, going through\\n      gestation and confinement normally, without recovering from neurasthenic\\n      prostration which, in the course of some years more, rendered her entirely\\n      helpless. Her condition was associated with a feeling of dropping to\\n      pieces unless supported and braced by a harness of wood, iron and leather,\\n      in which she \"sat up\" for several hours each day, spending the\\n      rest of the time in bed. Having left the patient in this condition, it was\\n      reported before the writer\\'s next professional visit that Mrs.-had been\\n      cured, and that she was able to go out like other people. A visit to the\\n      house confirmed the report. The patient came to the door herself, and in a\\n      quiet manner, entirely without the least expression of joy or wonder at\\n      her release, stated, that having heard of a famous \"magnetic\\n      physician,\" she summoned him, was ordered by him to arise and stand;\\n      protesting that it was impossible, she was raised to her feet and again\\n      ordered to stand, then to walk. Fearing that she would fall, she begged\\n      the magnetic doctor to support her, which he peremptorily refused, saying\\n      she might fall if she liked. Instead of falling, she had to walk about the\\n      room, was then placed upon a lounge and subjected to a severe treatment of\\n      rolling and pummelling, and then ordered to dress and sit up until tired,\\n      to remain up and about like other people, and to call on the doctor in\\n      future, as he would not come so far to the patient again. This happened\\n      about twenty-five years ago, and the patient has been in very fair health\\n      arrested by insisting that all professional visits by the writer or any\\n      other physician to whose sympathy the patient could appeal must cease.\\n      This injunction was carried out conscientiously with the best results by\\n      the husband of the patient. Perhaps we may learn from this that sometimes,\\n      at least, the familiar motto is reversed, and angels rush in where fools\\n      fear to tread.\\n      \\n Profiting by this experience, another\\n      neurasthenic woman, unmarried, but of most intractable, antagonistic\\n      temperament, confined to her bed, in and out of hospitals, for years,\\n      wearing out the strength and means of her relatives and the patience of\\n      many physicians, was at length abandoned by them. It was a case of spinal\\n      and cerebral neurasthenia complicated with hypochondriasis in its most\\n      trying form of introspective maunderings and endless description of\\n      symptoms. She tormented her advisers by her endless tirades, the\\n      indulgence of which invariably aggravated her condition, and were there\\n      fore avoided, until once her physician yielded to the patient\\'s\\n      importunities for a visit, when be found her in her usual abject state of\\n      prostration. Guided by experience derived from cases like the one first\\n      described, he assisted the patient to her feet and marched her, will you\\n      nil you, up and down the room until he, at least, was thoroughly tired,\\n      and then departed with the promise never to do so again. The patient, on\\n      her part, made a number of her unnameable promises, but kept on her feet\\n      and let the doctors alone. Though not cured of deeply-rooted morbid mental\\n      faults, the neurasthenic phase of her condition had yielded to the change\\n      of the antagonistic element of her character from passive to very\\n      practical activity. A third very serious case of this kind occurred in the\\n      person of a girl of fifteen, of selfish character, who gradually became\\n      bed-ridden with spinal and cerebral neurasthenia, and tormented with the\\n      usual multifarious painful sensations, none of which, on the most\\n      pains-taking physical examination, resulted from demonstrable organic\\n      disease of genital or abdominal organs. The patient was most tenderly\\n      cared for by her mother, who, in the course of years, became so imbued\\n      with the idea of yielding to every wish and whim of the patient, that at\\n      length remonstrance became useless. The mother, though recognizing the\\n      importance of persuading or urging her daughter to depend more on herself,\\n      admitted that she had yielded so long that now she must continue to feed,\\n      dress and assist her charge in the most trivial things. Her food had to be\\n      placed in her mouth, the position of a hand or foot changed by some one\\n      else, although patient did so spontaneously when she chose. This went on\\n      for fifteen years, when the mother, growing old and feeble, died. Her\\n      maternal support being gone, the patient at once proved her ability to\\n      walk, to dress, to feed herself, and to seek light employment. Though far\\n      from well, she is equally far fro being a helpless, bed-ridden invalid.\\n      \\n A fourth case, still very vividly\\n      impressed on the writer\\'s mind, was one of a healthy, romping girl of 14,\\n      who, as happen in this remarkably capricious disease, in the midst of\\n      perfect health, one day took to her bed and remained there with all the\\n      symptoms of neurasthenia, involving first the spinal and finally the\\n      cerebral nerves. This patient was very amiable, conscientious, and\\n      sensible, never loquacious, and not troubled with hypochondriacal thoughts\\n      or sensations. Tiredness was the only expression she used in describing\\n      her feelings. There was literally no variation from this condition, which\\n      confined her to her bed for years, till she grew from a girl to a woman.\\n      Eating and sleeping well, and improving perceptibly in personal appearance\\n      and character, yet she lay on her couch tired and watched over with\\n      unremitting care by a most anxious mother, showing her solicitude and\\n      sympathy in every feature. Once, in the second year of the disease, a\\n      favorable interruption occurred. The mother, still a young woman, gave\\n      birth to another child. During her confinement the neurasthenic patient\\n      was in charge of her mother\\'s nurse, assisted by other servants. The\\n      nurse, while devoted to the daughter, agreed with the writer that excess\\n      of sympathy was injurious, and used her best and judicious endeavors\\n      gradually to persuade the patient to make some physical effort at walking\\n      and standing. In this she was so successful that in two weeks she\\n      accompanied the girl on half-mile walks up and down hill, finally without\\n      assistance. Thus, recovery seemed assured, and everything was favorable\\n      progressing towards it when the mother, having fully recovered, again took\\n      charge of her daughter, with the result that she at once took to her\\n      lounge and remained there two years longer. About that time other advice\\n      was urged and gladly acceded to, with the result that the case was\\n      diagnosed by an eminent surgeon as spinal paralysis in consequence of\\n      concussion, though it could never be shown when and where it occurred.\\n      Salves, plasters, anodynes, nervines, and electricity did no good, but\\n      effectually destroyed appetite and digestion, which higher to had been\\n      normal. So this adviser resigned in favor of a third, who, being a younger\\n      and less prejudiced man, agreed perfectly with the writer\\'s original\\n      opinion. He advised return to moderate exercise, avoidance of drugs, and\\n      less display of sympathy. This, though formerly rejected as\\n      \"unkind,\" was now acceded to as coming from a nerve- specialist,\\n      fresh from Europe, at that time very rare. Still attending the other\\n      members of the family, the writer had sample opportunity of observing the\\n      course of the case. Improvement was very slow and uncertain till financial\\n      misfortune overtook the family. Almost with a bound our patient left her\\n      cough, and, organizing a kindergarten, strove energetically in supporting\\n      herself and assisting her mother. The change came about in less than three\\n      weeks, and resulted in perfect recovery.\\n      \\n At this point another very instructive\\n      case of very speedy recovery, after six or seven years of neurasthenic\\n      prostration, deserves to be mentioned. A woman of 35 had been in bed and\\n      on the lounge most of the time for nearly seven years, at the end of which\\n      time she became my patient, her regular medical attendant having gone to\\n      Europe. She was of very amiable disposition and as sensitive as she was\\n      weak. Her symptoms, as in the other cases, were instantaneous exhaustion\\n      on the least physical exertion. She could give herself up to no mental\\n      occupation beyond directing her house-hold affairs, the education of her\\n      son, and the rehearsal of her numerous sensations. She had not been my\\n      patient long when her husband failed in business, so that the family was\\n      reduced from very comfortable circumstances to a condition which made it\\n      necessary for the patient to make her own living and that of the family.\\n      This she almost at once proceeded to do, setting aside all other\\n      considerations and establishing a boarding-house, where she did most of\\n      the work herself. This she has done now for ten or twelve years without a\\n      serious relapse. The time involved in the period of convalescence was\\n      scarcely more than three weeks, a although her work maybe said to have\\n      begun at the moment her resolution was taken.\\n      \\n Prognostics.-From these and other cases\\n      in and outside of the writer\\'s practice, it is safe to say that the\\n      majority of cases of neurasthenia recover, though years may elapse before\\n      that period. We learn, furthermore, that recoveries, especially of very\\n      inveterate cases, depend on conditions beyond the control of the\\n      physician, as was the case in the above-recorded instances, where\\n      circumstances forced the patient to cases to wish for recovery and to make\\n      an effort of the will. This having been once accomplished self-confidence,\\n      for a long time in abeyance, was permanently restored.\\n      \\n Curability, further, depends very much\\n      on the temperament of the patient, whether amiable, tractable and\\n      confiding in the honest endeavors of the physician, or whether refractory,\\n      suspicious, untruthful, selfish and antagonistic, of a disposition\\n      impossible to win over on account of unnatural distrust of every\\n      well-meaning person. The degree of intelligence of patients also has a\\n      pronounced influence on the result. The most readily curable cases are\\n      those acquired without hereditary predisposition, where the cause is found\\n      in the absence of food and sleep, also where sorrow and anxiety can be\\n      averted or counteracted by judicious conduct of near relatives and\\n      friends.\\n      \\n Dietetic Treatment.-This, as medicinal\\n      treatment, must be governed by the stage at which the case comes into the\\n      physician\\'s hands-whether yet in its prodromal, its acute or its chronic\\n      phase. The prodromal stage of the disease has no very decided\\n      pathognomonic signs. The most that can be recognized in this stage is that\\n      the patient\\'s habits or duties are of a kind which will eventually lead to\\n      obdurate neurasthenia if not arrested in time by removing the exciting\\n      causes. Too much pleasure, as well as too much care, especially in girls\\n      and woman, tends to neglect of food and rest, in the absence of which,\\n      excitements, whether of pleasure or care, begets a state of unrest in\\n      which repose is disagreeable. With such a condition comes a list of\\n      incipient casual complaints of headache, imperfect sleep, notional ways of\\n      eating, working or playing. A few questions will determine whether the\\n      patient is living according to normal or abnormal habits with regard to\\n      appetite, sleep and occupation. Where these are found, their alteration to\\n      normal ways must be instead on. It is unnecessary to say that this is\\n      easier said than done, for it will probably meet with serious objections\\n      on the part of the patient, if not on that of her relatives; for most\\n      likely she has examinations for college to prepare for, involving several\\n      months of dose and careful study at night, and the patient cannot waste\\n      time in sleeping and eating while cramming that little excited and\\n      ambitions brain. A failure in the examinations would be as much of a\\n      disappointment to parents as to patient, who proves, as usual, that this\\n      appellation is a misnomer. She accordingly goes in as she please, lied by\\n      an increasing morbidly ambitions impulse, and the result is likely to be\\n      the mournful satisfaction on the part of the physician of being obliged to\\n      say, \"I told you before what would happen.\" Of course, all\\n      regret the now evident nerve-prostration, while, if the doctor had\\n      succeeded in enforcing his rules, he would in many cases experience the\\n      still more painful reproach of having been too severe. Nevertheless,\\n      absolute firmness and a kindly but unflinching exertion of his will,\\n      without the least compromise, reward the physician with the best results\\n      in such cases.\\n      \\n When the case, after the stage of\\n      excitement and untiring restlessness (at which it would still be speedily\\n      curable by simple dietetic rules) has, after weeks or months, entered upon\\n      the phase of painful prostration, here we encounter backache, oppressive\\n      headache, and absolute loss of mental or bodily endurance, measures of\\n      dietetic management are much less effective and much more difficult to\\n      find. it is at this stage that slight rise of temperature will occur,\\n      especially towards evening; then the backache and headache disappear, the\\n      pallor is replaced by a flush of color, the eyes lose their listless look,\\n      and the patient is inclined to enter upon some diversion or excitement,\\n      followed by a restless night and a morning of exhaustion and a renewal of\\n      all painful sensations. Most of such patients feel much better in the\\n      evening when they are ready for some entertainment, while in a normal\\n      state this would be the time for relaxation and repose.\\n      \\n The dietetic treatment of this stage is\\n      methodical rest. In severe cases the patient will do well to remain in bed\\n      for several days or even for weeks. It is well to shorten this period as\\n      much as possible and to insist on walking about, or, at least. sitting for\\n      a specified time every day. This may be varied b equally specified periods\\n      of rest in the recumbent position.\\n      \\n Irregularities of eating are at this\\n      and at all times to be superseded by the most rigid regularity of meals.\\n      The traditional and conventional three-meal system, however well adapted\\n      to the needs of a vigorous man or woman, does not agree with the\\n      neurasthenic patient. It is much better that these should eat oftener;\\n      four times a day is best in most cases, for the simple reason that in this\\n      way a patient, while eating less at a time, consumes more food in the\\n      aggregate.\\n      \\n As neurasthenic patients are rarely\\n      troubled with absolute aversion to wholesome food, they are generally able\\n      to consume a liberal quantity, about which it is only needful to remark\\n      here that the food should be selected from among the articles and dishes\\n      which the patient likes, provided they belong to the order of good, normal\\n      articles of food, to the exclusion of those which simply please the taste\\n      without being digestible. A dish entirely of meat or \"animal\\n      food\" is as far from being a good diet for neurasthenics as one\\n      consisting entirely of \"vegetable\" food. As a rule, the diet\\n      list should comprise one-third of nitrogenous material and two-thirds of\\n      carbohydrates. Together with these, it is a great mistake to neglect the\\n      fats, such as good butter and the fats of meats. And, lastly, every\\n      patient of this kind should be made to drink some water often, a dietetic\\n      feature too often neglected.\\n      \\n During this stage, actually fatiguing\\n      exercise of body and mind should be avoided, while, on the other hand, the\\n      patient\\'s mind should be directed away from herself, in which she is much\\n      assisted by withholding a certain kind of emotional sympathy, quite as\\n      natural as it is difficult to repress on the part of affectionate persons.\\n      Of this, a few words further on.\\n      \\n There is no definite time for the\\n      duration of this stage, which, however, depends largely on the time during\\n      which the exciting causes have acted, either aided by or without a\\n      predisposition. It is certain, however, that the sooner it is recognized\\n      and the exciting causes eliminated, so much the sooner recovery will\\n      begin. But there is a stage at which the best of experience and judgment\\n      often fail, especially in very inveterate cases. If the case is one of a\\n      patient whom the physician has had opportunity of watching at least since\\n      the earlier stages, the difficulty is not so great as it is in old cases\\n      months or even of several years\\' duration which come to treatment late. In\\n      these, the line between the intermediate stage and incipient convalescence\\n      cannot be drawn. The patient is as neurasthenic and hypochondriacal as\\n      ever; cannot bear the slightest mental or bodily exertion, not even a word\\n      or a look, without sings of apparent exhaustion, while nearly the whole\\n      time is spent in bed under anxious care of sympathetic attendants. In such\\n      cases, having become assured, by careful physical examination, of the\\n      absence of organic disease, seeing the patient generally well nourished\\n      and in fair muscular condition, the physician is warranted in assuming\\n      that the disease has run its course, that whatever morbid (pathological)\\n      process there may have been progressing in the nervous system, this\\n      process has now come to and end, but it has left the patient\\'s mental\\n      condition habituated to the moods of the past months or years, and fixed,\\n      as it were, indelibly in the memory. It is the habit that now remains, not\\n      the disease.\\n      \\n If reasonably sure of this, and calling\\n      to mind the rapid recoveries and the circumstances attending them, as\\n      above detailed, the physician is now safe in ordering a more energetic\\n      treatment, calculated to rouse the self-reliance of the patient. All\\n      visible signs of sympathy must now be set aside; the actins and demeanor\\n      of the attendants should, from this time, if not before, be changed so as\\n      to give the patient the impression that she is no longer an invalid, but\\n      expected to rely on her own exertion. Instead of being fed, the food\\n      should be placed where she must go for and eat it. She should now be\\n      expected to dress and attend, without assistance, to her natural wants.\\n      This, with some temperaments, is almost impossible, with al extremely\\n      difficult. The best course to pursue is to remove such patients from\\n      sympathetic relatives or friends, and to place them in charge of kind,\\n      reliable, but eminently practical nurses.\\n      \\n The first effect of this is either to\\n      throw the patient into a stage of helpless despondency, which, again\\n      appealing powerfully to the sympathies of those nearest to her, often\\n      frustrates the physician\\'s plans which, if firmly but kindly adhered to,\\n      would, ere long, prove of their superiority by signs of returning\\n      self-reliance and absence of complaints on the part of the patient. A\\n      second form of effect is that occurring in patients of obstreperous,\\n      selfish disposition, whose opposition and even anger is aroused by being\\n      thrown on their own resources after the removal of depressing and\\n      unpractical sympathy. This opposition or temper, often manifested in all\\n      sorts of intrigues and subterfuges on the part of the patient, if not\\n      supinely yielded to by sympathetic persons, will finally be replaced by a\\n      more rational disposition. On the whole, anger or active opposition are\\n      signs of returning energy, which, once coming to the consciousness of the\\n      patient, takes the form of self- reliance. it is this way that the cures\\n      of chronic cases above related can be explained, and physicians should\\n      profit by such experience for the benefit of their patients.\\n      \\n The general dietetic management now\\n      readily follows from what has been said, and needs only a few general\\n      modifications. The first duty of the physician will be to test the degree\\n      of reliance to be placed on the patient and her friends, ad to win them\\n      over if possible to his plans, and his success will be in proportion to\\n      the degree of confidence he is able to inspire. This personal confidence\\n      should not degenerate into a mere personal liking or attachment of a\\n      sympathy-craving neurasthenic who should discover henceforth that all\\n      sentimental expressing of sympathy are about to take a practical form,\\n      aiming at a definite result-the patient\\'s health-which she wishes but\\n      cannot exert her will to attain. The best and often the only way to do\\n      away with sentiment and to reach practical kindness is to remove the\\n      patient from certain home influence, and to place her in a hospital or\\n      elsewhere under the management of competent nurses who, without being\\n      selfish, know how to exert a certain amount of wholesome push as fast as\\n      the patient can bear it. Without the removal of sentimental sympathy, all\\n      efforts at counteracting the purely hypochondriacal side of neurasthenia\\n      are useless.\\n      \\n In these cases of neurasthenia as yet\\n      uncomplicated with the hypochondriacal element of introspective nosomania,\\n      there is only one unconditional rule to be followed, especially in\\n      acquired cases whose evident cause was incessant, conscientious work of\\n      mind and body, together with insufficient food and sleep. Such cases come\\n      on very insidiously, the loss of strength-that is, the actual waste of\\n      nerve-substance-being just a trifle grater than the quantity restored, the\\n      patient unconsciously using up a minute part of her capital every day.\\n      Here the rule should be to reverse matters to insuring a supply of\\n      nourishment and time for its assimilation greater than was the case\\n      heretofore. The case of young school-girls belong in this class. The time\\n      of food and rest should be carefully controlled at home, the duty of the\\n      physician being to educate indifferent and ignorant parents up to an\\n      appreciation of the nature of the case. It is generally not difficult to\\n      open their eyes through the medium of their anxiety concerning their\\n      children\\'s health. Having thus insured sufficient rest and food at home,\\n      the physician\\'s next object of attention should be the regulations of the\\n      school. Here is the point where teachers have an opportunity of exerting\\n      their most practical influence. It should be made obligatory on the part\\n      of teachers to institute inquiry as to whether pupils have had their meals\\n      before coming to school. This they could often ascertain without a\\n      question, by reading the pupil\\'s condition in her emaciated form, pale\\n      face and nervous manner. To guard against neglect at home, it would be an\\n      easy matter to insist that all pupils of public and private schools should\\n      bring with them some proper food. The few who do so generally bring\\n      sweets-an apple, orange or a few dry crackers-when a piece of good bread\\n      and slice of cold meat would be what they actually need. All pupils should\\n      pass inspection, and if remiss in this important particular, the\\n      delinquent should be dismissed with several marks against her. To expect\\n      this of teachers would be a great advance in the place of futile\\n      innovations of endeavoring to send forth from our common schools graduates\\n      in arts and sciences.\\n      \\n Sudden Effects.-A large number of cases\\n      of neurasthenia, especially those complicated with inveterate\\n      Hypochondriasis, are frequently traced to some sudden occurrence, having\\n      the effect of a mental or physical shock. In one patient, a vigorous girl,\\n      used to romping, climbing and running lie a boy, the cause was supposed to\\n      be a slight thump she received during a game of blindman\\'s-buff. She\\n      thought nothing of it at the time, but it was suggested long after the\\n      patient\\'s illness began. In another case some mental shock of joy or\\n      grief, not very severe and such as is often experienced in every person\\'s\\n      life, is the beginning of months of nervous prostration.\\n      \\n There is quite an array of evidence\\n      that neurasthenia which has entered upon a hypochondriacal stage or\\n      complication with or without a strong hysterical admixture, is curable by\\n      sudden impressions in the form of a shock, or more gradually by frequent\\n      repetitions of an impression. Such cases, as I have shown above, occur\\n      most commonly in the stage when what may be considered the essential\\n      pathological disturbances of function have run their course and have left\\n      the patient in a state of mental disturbance which indicated that the\\n      patient\\'s recovery depends entirely upon her volition. But there is none,\\n      and so far nothing has succeeded in arousing it. Persuasion is as useless\\n      and irritating, as argument would be in a case of insanity with a fixed\\n      illusion. The resemblance between this and the state of mind of a\\n      hypochondriacal neurasthenic is very close. She cannot move nor thick.\\n      Exhaustion overcomes her and keeps her its victim for years, when suddenly\\n      the scene changes, and a few days or weeks suffice to restore the patient\\n      to activity. In one instance it is attributed to medical, in another to\\n      \"mind cure,\" in a third to \"Christian science;\" in\\n      still other cases massage has done it, in others again \"magnetic\\n      influence,\" in others the very powerful factor necessity. It is\\n      certain that cases of this kind, produced by sudden effects on the mind of\\n      a predisposed person, are also cured by such effects. Whatever the visible\\n      form of these effects may be -whether that of \"Christian\\n      science,\" joy, grief or absolute inexorable necessity, there is\\n      always to be noticed a certain force and condition involving the modern\\n      idea of suggestion, which comes to the patient in an irresistible degree\\n      and now sets the function of the will in motion again.\\n      \\n Experience teaches that it is by no\\n      means a matter of indifference which of these forms of effect are brought\\n      into action. In one case it is the professional Christian scientist\\'s\\n      method, in another the almost brutal exertion of a person\\'s will combined\\n      with some physical force. In either case the patient is aroused from his\\n      inertia, and discovers his powers of mental and bodily ability to act.\\n      \\n A deplorable result is that recoveries\\n      after such effects are attributed in the popular mind to supernatural\\n      causes. That such is not the case may be gathered form instances occurring\\n      in very sensible and intelligent patients, whose reason is scarcely ever\\n      so far disturbed and weakened that they do not resent the proposition of\\n      trying, e.g., Christian science or mind cure.\\n      \\n Nevertheless, it is the mind cure which\\n      the intelligent patient needs quite as much as the ignorant and\\n      superstitious person; the difference is only the form in which the\\n      influencing force is applied. While in one case it is obedience to the\\n      candidly expressed instructions of the physician, in the other case the\\n      result is the to mystification. In either case it is the powerful stimulus\\n      of hope and aroused confidence that recovery will be realized.\\n      \\n The definition of suggestion does not\\n      fully cover the meaning, because the influence employed is greater than\\n      mere suggestion. The physician\\'s plan of action should be straightforward\\n      assurance of recovery, a direct appeal to hope, and an unceasing endeavor\\n      to arouse the self-reliance of the patient, not so much by verbal\\n      exhortations as by a manner and department from which the patient learns\\n      more readily than from words what is expected. If the attitude of the\\n      physician is appreciated, and seconded by the relatives and attendants, a\\n      favorable result is much more certain to follow.\\n      \\n Hypnotism is not advisable. There are\\n      now existing ancient neurasthenic invalids dating from the times of\\n      spiritualism when they were famous \"mediums.\" Hypnotism weakness\\n      the will and nervous endurance, and produces a predisposition to emotional\\n      nervousness with an intractable erotic admixture. The suggestions sought\\n      to be instilled into a hypnotized patient amount to nothing. The mental\\n      influence of mystical treatment administered while the patients is awake\\n      is much more powerful in awaking hope and confidence than the uncertain\\n      effects of an abnormal state like that of hypnotism. Mystification, again,\\n      though sometimes unavoidable with the best intention, is less powerful\\n      than direct and intelligible encouragement. While resort to mystification\\n      should be shunned by reputable physicians, the question arises as to what\\n      shall be done with the many who, from lack of intelligence or education,\\n      are entirely beyond the reach of honest common sense, and who will persist\\n      in mystifying themselves, who remain neurasthenic invalids in spite of the\\n      best regulations of the physician, and who do not recover unless their\\n      encouragement follows some mystical formalities which alone arouse their\\n      \"faith\" and finally their confidence and will-power. For the\\n      present there is no way out of the dilemma but to submit such patients to\\n      the suggestive methods of what is popularly known as mind cure and\\n      Christian science. In doing so, physicians should use their influence as\\n      far as possible in selecting the most honest persons of this class.\\n      \\n DISCUSSION.\\n      \\n JAMES C. WOOD, M.D.: I have nothing but\\n      words of praise for Dr. Wesselhoeft\\'s excellent paper. It is very evident\\n      that the author\\'s inspiration came not from books but from actual contact\\n      with neurasthenic subjects, for the impress of originality is most\\n      conspicuous. It is a production which could only come from one of\\n      experience and from a reasoner. I consider it a most valuable contribution\\n      to the literature of that now most interesting subject,\\n      \"neurasthenia\".\\n      \\n The doctor, in his paper, has sometimes\\n      used the term \"neurasthenia\" instead of\\n      \"neurasthenia.\" The first of these means, according to Thomas,\\n      great nervous power or excitement; the second, nervous debility. I taken\\n      it from the context that the subject dealt with is neurasthenia. To the\\n      average mind there exists what seems to me a needless confusion regarding\\n      the terms, nervous prostration, hysteria and hystero-neurosis. As I\\n      understand these terms they define distinct conditions, though there is a\\n      frequent blending the one with the other. The term nervous prostration,\\n      which is a synonym of neurasthenia, defines itself; the term hysteria\\n      should be restricted to those general neuroses characterized particularly\\n      by psychical manifestations, though not infrequently by motor, sensory,\\n      secretory, vasomotor and reflex derangements as well; while the term\\n      hysteroneurosis implies the uterine origin of symptoms manifesting\\n      themselves in organs remote from the uterus without structural changes in\\n      such organs, being the direct result of reflex nervous influence starting\\n      from the uterus. The last term does not occur in the paper under\\n      discussion. From the standpoint of a gynecologist I think that this is\\n      misleading.\\n      \\n Let us see why and how it is that these\\n      three conditions (I will not call them diseases) are so frequently\\n      associated. I think that all will admit the frequent occurrence in woman\\n      of reflex symptoms, the result of pelvic lesions. An irritation staring\\n      form the pelvis is conveyed to the genito-spinal centre, thence to any or\\n      all organs with which this centre communicates. The organ oftener involved\\n      than any other is the stomach. This is shown by the frequent occurrence of\\n      nausea and vomiting following conception. The nervous system may have been\\n      previously involved, but oftener it becomes so only after the nutrition is\\n      depraved, which, sooner or later, occurs if the pelvic lesion is not\\n      removed. The depraved blood fails to supply the nerve centres with that\\n      which they need to sustain them, and they become anaemic. Prostration is\\n      but a subjective manifestation of the anaemia, and it varies in degree\\n      from a slight indisposition to the most abject helplessness.\\n      \\n If, then, nervous prostration may have\\n      its beginning in a pelvic lesion, is it possible for a pelvic lesion to be\\n      inaugurated by systemic disturbances? Personally, I believe that it is,\\n      and offer this explanation as the modus operandi by which such a lesion is\\n      induced: Marked circulatory changes nearly always attend nervous\\n      prostration. The circulation is presided over by the vaso-motor system,\\n      and wear and repair depend upon the proper regulation of this system. If\\n      it becomes disturbed, the bloodvessels dilate or contract unduly, with\\n      resulting local hyperaemia or local anaemia, as the case maybe. The\\n      climacteric flushes are the result of such disturbance. The alternate\\n      coldness and heat of the extremities, so often associated with rectal and\\n      uterine lesions, is another familiar illustration. If the brain is\\n      involved, either insomnia or drowsiness occur, depending upon whether the\\n      brain is anaemic or hyperaemic. Flatulence, gastralgia, and nervous\\n      dyspepsia result when the stomach is similarly affected. The womb and the\\n      ovaries, because of the periodical congestion imposed upon them, are\\n      oftener implicated by these unnatural circulatory disturbances than any of\\n      the pelvic organs, and in time also become unduly hyperaemic or anaemic,\\n      as the case may be.\\n      \\n It will thus be seen that nervous\\n      prostration may exist independently of pelvic lesions, or, conversely,\\n      pelvic lesions may exist independently of nervous prostration.\\n      Nevertheless, the two are frequently associated, and this fact ought, I\\n      believe, to be kept in mind in dealing with the affection known as\\n      neurasthenia. Hysterical manifestations nearly always come to the surface\\n      in nervous prostration, and they also frequently attend pelvic lesions.\\n      Indeed, the term \"hystero-psychosis\" has been coined for the\\n      purpose of defining certain psychical disturbances of presumably pelvic\\n      origin, and in the broadest sense neurasthenia is not uncommonly an\\n      hysteroneurosis. It is the frequent association of these three conditions\\n      which, it seems to me, makes it more practicable to study them conjointly.\\n      \\n The special symptoms of nervous\\n      prostration are most variable. Introspection, as Dr. Wesselhoeft has\\n      pointed out, makes of the patient a nosomaniac. The anaemic nerve centres\\n      are unduly impressionable, and a mental shock which would not seriously\\n      affect a stronger and more rugged woman falls with crushing force upon one\\n      whose nutrition is already depraved. In this way are developed disorders\\n      of sensibility, alternations of mobility, circulatory disturbances,\\n      anomalies of secretion and exertion, disorders of the gastro-intestinal\\n      canal, dermatoses, and general and psychical disturbances of all kinds.\\n      Many of these affections start from pelvic lesions, and are nearly always\\n      associated with depravity of nutrition and more or less nervous\\n      prostration.\\n      \\n Some of the worst symptoms of\\n      neurasthenia with which I have had to contend have been hyperaesthesia of\\n      the articulations, giving rise to the so-called \"hysterical\\n      joint.\" Here the prostration is usually not profound, and it is\\n      possible to apply the somewhat energetic treatment recommended by Dr.\\n      Wesselhoeft. I remember one case very distinctly, the detailed history of\\n      which I shall give in another place, which brought me much reputation\\n      because of the \"remarkable\" cure I was fortunate enough to make.\\n      \\n The patient, a beautiful girl of\\n      eighteen, had been bed- ridden for three years with supposed hip-joint\\n      disease. She was in college before assuming the ride of an invalid, and\\n      worried much over her studies and work. She sustained a fall a short time\\n      previously to taking to her bed, and to this fall the injury to the hip\\n      was attributed. She had been from physician to physician and from\\n      sanitarium to sanitarium without receiving benefit. All of the numerous\\n      medical men under whose care she had been, directed their attention to the\\n      hip and applied the classical treatment for morbus coxarius without avail.\\n      The patient had finally reached a point where introspection was her chief\\n      occupation and her mind dwelt almost continually upon a \"diseased\\n      hip.\" She was finally brought to me, coming in an invalid\\'s chair and\\n      looking the very picture of dependency. There was a slight degree of\\n      anaemia, though this was not marked. Notwithstanding the expression\\n      expression of abjectness the girl did not look seriously ill. The hip was\\n      excessively tender upon pressure, but there was no local increase of\\n      temperature, no evidences of fever and suppuration, and forcible\\n      apposition by striking the heel was not very painful. More less spastic\\n      contraction of the flexor muscles of the affected side existed, which gave\\n      to the limb an appearance of actual shortening, which was very deceptive.\\n      Hysterical symptoms were common. On examination I found the left ovary\\n      exquisitely tender. Compression of the ovary increased the pain in the hip\\n      most decidedly and gave rise to much nervous agitation. I did not,\\n      therefore, deem it wise to recommend local treatment other than the daily\\n      use of the hot douche. She had long been a victim of ovarian\\n      dysmenorrhoea. I placed upon the ankle of the affected limb three pounds\\n      of bar-lead, prescribed a pair of crutches and insisted upon her walking.\\n      The lead was used to overcome the spastic contraction as well as for its\\n      moral effect. I did not deem the joint lesion of such a character as to\\n      used extension. In two months\\' time this patient discarded her crutches\\n      for a cane. Six weeks later she put up the cane and is now perfectly well.\\n      \\n This was a case in which somewhat harsh\\n      measures were eminently appropriate.\\n      \\n In marked contrast to the case just\\n      recorded is the following: Mrs.-, aet. 47, widow for twenty years. She is\\n      a devoted church-woman, and for years was a leader in all charitable work\\n      done in the community in which she resided. Through friends she was urged\\n      to consult me, and I think that the call to the neighboring town in which\\n      she lived was countermanded at least four or five times before the finally\\n      mustered up courage and strength enough to see me. Upon reaching the\\n      bedside I found my patient in a room made dark by closed blinds, over\\n      which were hung heavy blankets to shut out every ray of light. The mirror\\n      was turned toward the wall for fear a ray of light might strike it and\\n      flesh throughout the darkened room. Nor did the patient rest under these\\n      extreme precautions, for the eyes were protected with two pairs of colored\\n      glasses with side attachments. Hyperaesthesia of the sense of hearing was\\n      equally marked and the noise was excluded from the room by double doors\\n      whose keyholes were stuffed with cotton. She l so had her ears filled with\\n      cotton, over which she wore ear-mufflers. She was emaciated to an extreme\\n      degree, and had been reduced to her miserable condition by a series of\\n      events which frequently precede profound neurasthenia. Her husband was\\n      killed during the war, and she was left childless. Twelve months previous\\n      to taking to her bed she nursed her mother through a long and fatal\\n      illness. This greatly prostrated her, yet she kept up until a favorite\\n      brother-in-law was thrown from a carriage and killed. This was the last\\n      straw, and the shock compelled her to take to her bed. In due time loss of\\n      appetite with irritability of the stomach developed, which, of course, led\\n      to marked depravity of nutrition. With the anaemia came hyperaesthesia of\\n      the special senses, spinal irritation, headache, hysterical\\n      manifestations, etc. There was no series pelvic lesion, although she had\\n      been much treated for an alleged uterine displacement with congestion.\\n      Unfortunately, she was encouraged, instead of discouraged, in her\\n      invalidism, and she soon became a nosomaniac of the worst type. She had\\n      written down her symptoms one at a time, and the record is such a typical\\n      one that I should like to give it in full, but time forbids.\\n      \\n With great difficulty the patient was\\n      moved on a cough to a private hospital and placed under the Weir Mitchell\\n      treatment. I ignored the pelvic trouble entirely. It is unnecessary to\\n      give in detail the progress of the case from day to day after this\\n      treatment was inaugurated. Suffice it to say that the improvement was of\\n      the most marked character, and in six weeks from the time she entered the\\n      hospital she walked to her carriage with her eyes and ears unprotected.\\n      She soon resumed her church and charitable work, in which she again takes\\n      much delight.\\n      \\n This woman wanted to get well. She was\\n      a woman of pure motives and high ideals. She had, in the language of Dr.\\n      Wesselhoeft, the wish, but, unaided, not the will. She required the aid of\\n      an intelligent, strong-minded, nurse who could bring to her exercise\\n      applied in such a way as to enable her to assimilate food without the\\n      expenditure of nerve force. She co- operated with her physician and nurse\\n      in every possible way, and as soon as the anaemic nerve cells became\\n      flushed with new blood she began to improve. To have commanded this\\n      patient \"to take up her bed and walk\" before improving her\\n      nutrition would have been as unscientific as to have placed the first\\n      patient in bed with extension and counter-extension applied to the limb. I\\n      know of no class of cases requiring for their successful treatment more\\n      tact and discrimination than that under consideration.\\n      \\n I feel confident that I have many times\\n      cut the affection short in its prodromal stage by removing the girl from\\n      college work and insisting upon open-air exercise. Static electricity has,\\n      in my hands, proved exceedingly useful both during the prodromal stage and\\n      that of convalescence.\\n      \\n I will conclude by saying that I have\\n      been impressed with the frequency with which an hereditary history of\\n      epilepsy has been met with in the cases of neurasthenia passing under my\\n      observation.'\n",
      " 'Tresorie - SOME OF THE DISEASES PREVENTING AND COMPLICATION PREGNANCY\\n[Diseases Preventing & Complicating Pregnancy]\\n\\n STERILITY.-DeSinety, Treub, Furbinger,\\n      et al., attribute 50 per cent. of unproductive marriages to the husbands,\\n      saying that sterility in the male is more often the cause of barren\\n      marriages than is generally supposed.\\n      \\n This cause of sterility I pass by, as\\n      also sterility due to mechanical obstruction, incomplete ovulation and the\\n      numerous other causes of this condition, too manifold for mere\\n      enumeration, to consider obesity as a causative agent in this condition. I\\n      need not say that the advocates for surgical interference for the relief\\n      of this condition are legion. Sims makes the assertion that sterility can\\n      be cured by surgical means only. That, of course, is Allopathic arguing\\n      pure and simple. Cases requiring surgical interference do arise, but any\\n      treatment which raises the nutrition of the entire organism, improves the\\n      blood-formation, and favors the resorption of pathological products in the\\n      sexual organs, is to be regarded as the indicated remedy.\\n      \\n Published statements are my authority\\n      for saying that excellent results have followed the administration of\\n      drugs, nevertheless; and in complete defiance of all therapeutic measures,\\n      a certain percentage of women remain barren; for with the more occult\\n      causes of sterility we remain, as yet, unacquainted, consequently they\\n      cannot all be reached with say kind of treatment whatever.\\n      \\n The following case I report somewhat in\\n      detail. Whilst not an exceptional case at all, it bears directly upon the\\n      subject under consideration, and possesses, it seems to me, some decidedly\\n      interesting features. My object in selecting this particular one is to\\n      call attention, if possible, to a condition not sufficiently considered.\\n      Mrs. J., aet. 26, married about two years and a half, appealed to my\\n      knowledge for a reason as to why she remained childless. The lady was\\n      carrying an excess of flesh, being under the medium height, and weighing\\n      186 pounds, but appeared to be in good health; family and previous history\\n      all that could be desired. Examination showed none of the common causes of\\n      sterility; neither, so far as I could ascertain, was the husband\\n      responsible for this unproductive condition of affairs. Some previous\\n      experiences of my own, with the added testimony of other and able men, was\\n      my reason for charging this condition of things to the excess of flesh,\\n      this, by the husband, being laughingly charged to excess of laziness.\\n      \\n We all, undoubtedly, are familiar with\\n      that peculiar disease of the blood-corpuscles which, whilst producing\\n      flesh, relaxes at the same time the muscular force; acting also, I\\n      believe, upon the muscular fibres of the uterus and upon the ovaries,\\n      inducing not only serious menstrual disorders but sterility. McKee,\\n      Philbert, and others give several instances of sterility chargeable to\\n      obesity, the women in question having been married several years without\\n      bearing children, and all became mothers after losing a portion of their\\n      flesh. If any other argument were needed in support of this theory we\\n      might turn to the quadrupeds, where we find the poorest breeders among the\\n      fleshiest animals. Fournel has a very able treatise on \"The Effects\\n      of Obesity on the Menstrual Functions and Parturition.\" Without\\n      having had any actual case of this description to deal with, he inclines\\n      very strongly towards the belief that obesity favors sterility. In the\\n      treatment of the case before mentioned, the patient was subjected to a\\n      daily massage of the entire body, with a special pelvic massage three\\n      times a week. This, in the main, consists in elevating the uterus as high\\n      as possible with the finger in the vagina, ending with a quick and decided\\n      vibratory motion. The diet received particular attention, as at this time\\n      there was a slight gastric ailment. The indicated remedy, Thuja, was given\\n      in the minimum dose. At the end of three months almost thirty pounds of\\n      flesh was gone, a considerable reduction. As an experiment, I recommended\\n      coitus in the knee-elbow position, advising that the lady remain quiet as\\n      long as possible after coition, with thighs well flexed. She became\\n      enciente, but miscarried at eight weeks. There was, comparatively\\n      speaking, but little pain and not much subsequent haemorrhage. She made a\\n      rapid recovery. Since then a living child has been born to them.\\n      \\n I believe I am safe in saying that this\\n      result would hardly have obtained were it not for the prophylactic\\n      measures adopted.\\n      \\n At the end of the first two months the\\n      patient was attacked with haemorrhage. A similar occurrence took place at\\n      irregular intervals during the following five months, the quantity of\\n      blood lost being much greater than that at the normal menstrual period.\\n      \\n For the greater part of the last five\\n      months she kept her bed, at the end of which time the tendency of the\\n      uterus to empty itself could be resisted no longer. A seven months\\' child\\n      was born, and is to-day doing well.\\n      \\n Pseudocyesis cerebral pregnancy,\\n      phantom pregnancy (whatever name we may call it by) is a disease which\\n      must come under the head of those \"complicating pregnancy.\" Mrs.\\n      M., a lady, married two or three years, aet. 29. Previous history good,\\n      always enjoying perfect health. When I first saw the lady in question she\\n      was a perfect picture of health, and, according to appearance and her own\\n      statements, about seven months pregnant. I made no examination. This\\n      appeared to be a thoroughly intelligent woman, and, according to her own\\n      statement, there was cessation of the menses. There certainly was an\\n      enlargement of the abdomen and breasts, a milky secretion, and the lady\\n      was sure that she felt foetal movement. On February 28th of the present\\n      year I was called to attend her in labor. Examination showed that no\\n      pregnancy existed. So far as I could ascertain there was no assignable\\n      origin for this condition other than nervous influences, the phenomena\\n      being purely muscular distension of the abdomen.\\n      \\n Mayham reports a case of a woman 73\\n      years old, claiming to be pregnant; he also claims that subsequently she\\n      was delivered of a child; this is an Allopathic report, however, of which\\n      we will take a Homoeopathic dose. Haultain reports three cases of cerebral\\n      pregnancy. In the first, he says no cause whatever was to be found; in the\\n      second, there was a small fibroid growth in the anterior uterine wall.\\n      Hauck reports a case where the vomiting, peristalsis, and flatus, caused\\n      by alcoholism were supposed to be caused by the pregnant state. Such cases\\n      are uncommon, but they emphasize the importance of making a thorough\\n      examination, in all cases where positive information is desired of the\\n      existence or non-existence of pregnancy.\\n      \\n Hyperemesis Gravidarum.-An animated\\n      discussion, held recently between two celebrated Allopaths of Stuttgart\\n      and Leipsic, has served to awaken a renewed interest in this subject,\\n      without in the least adding anything new to our stock of knowledge\\n      regarding its aetiology. Notwithstanding the frequency of the vomiting of\\n      pregnancy, its very distressing character in many instances, and its\\n      imminent, its very distressing character in many instances, and its\\n      imminent danger, we find but very few contributions of any value, to\\n      either the aetiology of the disorder or its therapeutics. I do not expect\\n      to add anything specially new myself, but it does seem to me that our\\n      knowledge of the vomiting of pregnancy, is to say the least, in a most\\n      contradictory state. Some physicians look upon it as a trifling matter,\\n      others as a thing to be endured, and some-these are in the right too-view\\n      even the mildest cases with gravity. Even in the mildest cases of morning\\n      sickness there is a constant drain upon the nervous system, putting the\\n      sufferer into a condition, in which she is very much less able to endure\\n      parturition than she would otherwise have been.\\n      \\n Dr. Harrison Mettler says: \"After\\n      careful inquiry I find that women who suffer from much morning sickness\\n      have as a rule, tedious or otherwise troublesome labors. I have observed\\n      in multiparae that at one time they will have much nausea and vomiting\\n      followed by a difficult labor, while at another time they will be quite\\n      free from the vomiting, and will pass through the succeeding labor with\\n      comparative ease.\" I must say my observations make me agree with Dr.\\n      Mettler entirely; when one thinks how rapidly the mildest of cases assume\\n      pernicious forms, indifference is certainly no longer to be excused. There\\n      is a voluminous literature upon this subject, and many and varied are the\\n      aetiological reasons given for this very variable affection, a large\\n      majority of writers coinciding in the opinion that \"many causes\\n      operate together,\" to produce what we are pleased to designate the\\n      \"vomiting of pregnancy.\" I believe myself that in a large\\n      percentage of cases, this pernicious vomiting is simply the result of a\\n      reflex neurosis. Undoubtedly uterine displacements frequently cause\\n      vomiting; but when this is so, and the displaced organ is raised by\\n      packing the vagina with aseptic wool, the vomiting ceases.\\n      \\n Lillie reports a number of cases, where\\n      obstinate vomiting was caused by a retroflexed uterus, and restoration of\\n      the organ caused a cessation of the disorder. Bezugloff having a\\n      persistent case of morning sickness, introduced a bougie it no the uterus,\\n      the intention being to produce abortion; the immediate result was a\\n      stoppage of the vomiting, and the pregnancy went on to full term.\\n      \\n In the case just cited, I must say that\\n      I believe it was the fright, caused by the thought of abortion being\\n      performed, more than the effects of introducing the bougie, which operated\\n      so successfully; I say now, as I said before, I believe that the\\n      pre-eminent cause of this kind of sickness must be looked for i the\\n      nervous system. Flint speaks of this form of sickness as being decidedly\\n      neurotic in its origin, and cites a number of cases of a chronic variety\\n      of dyspepsia frequently occurring in young girls. I had one such case come\\n      under my personal care. There was a persistent morning sickness, with this\\n      young lady, and a disagreeable nausea whenever food was taken; this\\n      patient was at some distance from her home, in a boarding school, and she\\n      will probably never know that the lady principal entertained very grave\\n      thoughts at one time in regard to her virtue. It certainly was very\\n      difficult to differentiate between this and the vomiting of pregnancy; it\\n      was, however, simply due to a vitiated nervous system. My theory is\\n      supported by Alt, who records a number of such cases; I cite one only, the\\n      case being that of a highly hysterical woman, six months pregnant,\\n      suffering from the gravest vomiting, and anxious that miscarriage be\\n      induced. She was making preparation for entering the hospital for this\\n      purpose, when one of her children was seized with pneumonia. The anxiety\\n      felt over the child, forced all thought of self from the mother\\'s mind;\\n      from that moment the vomiting ceased and she remained well until the\\n      termination of pregnancy.-Minchener Medicinische Wochenschrift.\\n      \\n Whilst saying that I believe this\\n      disease to be in the majority of cases of purely nervous origin, I would\\n      not imply thereby that it is not to be feared, far from it; if neglected,\\n      we know how likely it is to pass quickly beyond treatment and our patient\\n      succumb from sheer exhaustion.\\n      \\n In the treatment cited such as\\n      insertion of bougies, dilation of the os, pelvic massage, etc., I believe\\n      it is merely the \"doing something,\" no matter much what it is,\\n      so long as you have gained the confidence of your patient, that does good.\\n      We have seen how suddenly Hyperemesis will cease if the patient be\\n      alarmed; it may be, has often been, and will to again, cured by a process\\n      skin to suggestion. Kattenback had a case where the patient, a primipara,\\n      was seized with an incorrigible vomiting. It was suggested to her that her\\n      stomach contained some lumps of unwholesome material and their removal\\n      would cure her. Some milk was given her, and the stomach ceremoniously\\n      washed out. its contents bore no indications of either over-acidity or\\n      abnormal ferment She was informed that she was all right and the vomiting\\n      would not return; neither did if, and she was safely delivered at term.\\n      \\n There is a familiar and now well-know\\n      phenomena, by which these neurotics can be influenced; I speak of\\n      hypnotism; it is due to purely subjective conditions.\\n      \\n There is an identity of the hypnotic\\n      susceptibility with the condition of hysteria, and it is along these lines\\n      that we can work. Just as many times as I have tried this method of\\n      treatment, for these cases of excessive vomiting, just so many times has\\n      it given me gratifying results.\\n      \\n The patient can be to sleep by\\n      bi-ocular pressure, and the idea of cure suggested; the operation may have\\n      to be repeated several times, at intervals of a day or so, but you will be\\n      rewarded by the cessation of the vomiting, often with but one suggestion.\\n      Where the patient is not easily controlled by means of the bi-ocular\\n      pressure, Luy\\'s revolving mirror is a never failing resource.'\n",
      " 'Tresorie - PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS [Presidential Address]\\n\\n THE ROLE OF HOMOEOPATHY IN THE SECOND\\n      \\n By ALVA BENJAMIN, M.B.CH.B., F.F.HOM.\\n      \\n Such a system of medicine must\\n      recognize that it is as much an art as a science, and that healing is a\\n      relationship between two living personalities. It must recognize too, that\\n      the sick individual has to take an active part in his treatment and not be\\n      merely the passive recipient of this or that treatment. For just as it is\\n      rightly said that man does not live by alone, so should it be emphasized\\n      that man cannot be cured by medicine alone. He must see to it himself that\\n      he lives as far as possible a physically and psychically healthy life.\\n      Indeed, each individual has a power within himself to help in his own\\n      cure.\\n      \\n Do the official schools of medicine\\n      teach such an art today? I am afraid not: they are so intent on seeking\\n      the specific treatment for this or that named disease or the antibiotic\\n      that will most effectively put out of action the organism regarded as the\\n      cause of the disease, that they are losing sight of the individual\\n      himself.\\n      \\n But Homoeopathy in its persistent\\n      search for the reactions of the individual to his environment in the\\n      broadest sense, no matter of what the patient is complaining surely\\n      fulfills these requirements, especially when it is recognized that the\\n      homoeopathic potencies do not anything to the patient as do the drugs of\\n      the dominant school, but rather stimulate the patients own recuperative\\n      powers to overcome the infection or re - establish the normal metabolism\\n      which has become deranged by the illness.\\n      \\n When you consider how the homoeopathic\\n      physician diagnoses the individuality of his patient over and above the\\n      name of the disease from which he is suffering, and uses for the purpose\\n      of his prescription rather than the name of the disease this personal\\n      diagnosis of the patients mental and emotional reactions, his responses to\\n      changes in weather conditions, the alternations in his environment which\\n      influence his symptoms, etc., one realize how very individualistic is the\\n      Homoeopathic prescription fitted to that particular patient.\\n      \\n The homoeopathic physician does not\\n      seek for a remedy specific to any named disease and which he can thus\\n      apply almost automatically once he has made his organic diagnosis, which\\n      in quite an appreciable number of instances may ultimately be found to be\\n      wrong and so the treatment based upon it must therefore have been wrong.\\n      He does not, as is so often done, merely suppress the most outstanding\\n      symptom by an appropriate drug; for example giving an anodyne to mask the\\n      pain or removing the skin eruption by some strong local application, in\\n      other words putting the dust under the mat and pretending the room is\\n      clean.\\n      \\n Strangely enough the homoeopathic\\n      physician is often accused by his allopathic critic in his ignorance of\\n      Homoeopathy, of merely treating symptoms, whereas it is the critic himself\\n      who practices this superficial medicine. The homoeopathic physician, on\\n      the other hand, treats his patient as a whole through his symptoms and\\n      their modifications through changes in the environment, which is quite a\\n      different matter.\\n      \\n Homoeopathic therapy, unlike methods of\\n      treatment, is based on a natural law \"Similia Similibus\\n      Curentur\" \"Likes may be cured by likes\" which has been\\n      proved time and time again by experiment and which anyone with the will to\\n      do may prove for himself. It is not subject to constant change brought\\n      about by this or that latest discovery, and which itself will soon have to\\n      give way to the still later idea.\\n      \\n Having now introduced to you our actor,\\n      what of the scene in which he is to play his role?\\n      \\n This is the nineteen hundred and fifty\\n      - fourth year of the Christian era and the second year of the reign of our\\n      much loved and admired young Queen Elizabeth II, who will remember while\\n      in south Africa on her twenty - first birthday, before she had any idea\\n      that she would so soon be called to such an exalted position as she holds\\n      today, broadcast to the commonwealth and Empire her resolve to dedicate\\n      her life to the service of this grand community which dedication she\\n      recently repeated at her Coronation.\\n      \\n Here in Great Britain we have a more or\\n      less complete welfare state, with which idea some of us may very strongly\\n      disagree, whilst others believe such a development is the result of a\\n      natural very desirable social evolution.\\n      \\n As one necessary ingredient of this\\n      welfare state came, in 1948, the initiation of the National Health\\n      Service, through which the great majority of the population receives its\\n      medical attention, although it is rightly available to all.\\n      \\n When we come to consider the role that\\n      homoeo - therapeutics should play in this scheme, I would suggest that we\\n      should regard the problem from the purely medical aspect, forgetting any\\n      political party allegiances or sympathies we may have; or if we cannot\\n      forget them we should remember that the organization of the National\\n      Insurance Scheme of which the National Health Service is but a part, was\\n      first blue printed by the well - known Liberal supporter, Lord Beveridge,\\n      and the Health Service plans developed by the Coalition Government of all\\n      three major political parties.\\n      \\n We are living at present in an age\\n      which may very justifiably be regarded as a violent age in which have been\\n      developed so many appalling instruments of destruction, the use of some of\\n      which we are quite complacently accepting and from the use of others we\\n      are refraining, not because we consider them immoral, but simply through\\n      the fear of the wholesale destruction which would be caused by their use.\\n      We are seeing X-rays used in very high voltages in the treatment of\\n      cancer, we are being constantly remained of the use of dangerous drugs in\\n      medicine, without justification, in my opinion, bearing in mind the\\n      doubtful and evanescent ameliorations they produce and the violent\\n      surgical treatment of mental patients.\\n      \\n One further violence we should not\\n      forget is the way some of our foods are devitalized by the extraction of\\n      this or that portion of the natural product for purposes quite foreign to\\n      the well - being of the people who are to feed on them; or they are\\n      contaminated by the addition of this or that dangerous chemical, either\\n      during the growing of the plant, in the form of sprays, or as so called\\n      improvers in, for instance, the manufacture of white bread. It is very\\n      significant in this regard that quite a lot of attention is paid to the\\n      protection of the man who sprays the crops, but the right of the consumer\\n      to have uncontaminated food is slurred over by the unjustifiable statement\\n      that the amount of these chemicals so consumed is so small that it cannot\\n      have any bad effect on the consumer. We who practice Homoeopathy know how\\n      unwarranted is such a statement.\\n      \\n Can we homoeopathic physicians and\\n      patient hope to be able to do anything to make the still small voice of\\n      Homoeopathy heard in all this tumult, so that we may return to a saner and\\n      more healthful way of life and help our young Queen in her lifes work for\\n      the communitys sake?\\n      \\n Can we expect any help from the leaders\\n      of the medical profession? I am afraid not, because although I believe it\\n      accurate to state that there is a very slowly growing interest in, and\\n      tolerance of our work by individual doctors, the medical authorities are\\n      still, in their prejudice, strongly opposed to us. The London University\\n      still refuses to recognize our Hospital as a post - graduate teaching\\n      Hospital: the British Medical Association prohibits the formation of a\\n      homoeopathic section of its organization, and the Royal College of\\n      Physicians still refuses its membership to any one known as a homoeopathic\\n      physician. Yet in spite of this unfavourable environment, I firmly believe\\n      that there is a future for our method of therapeutics: but it will have to\\n      be pursued with courage, determination, foresight and energy. Surely if we\\n      believe as I do, that we are the guardians of a system of treatment\\n      destined to make our people healthier and therefore more efficient and\\n      happier, we would be failing in our duty to our country if we did not take\\n      every means in our power to acquaint the community at large with the\\n      advantages of this system and the dangers of ignoring it. This is a duty,\\n      not only of the profession, but also of the laity interested in\\n      Homoeopathy and who have experienced its benefits.\\n      \\n Every physician has two professional\\n      obligation to the community, that of preserving its health and that of\\n      endeavouring to restore it to being when it has fallen by the way.\\n      \\n The homoeopathic physician, thorough\\n      his knowledge acquired through the provings of drugs, even in\\n      infinitesimal doses, has, I believe, a very special responsibility as\\n      regards the prophylaxis of disease. It seems to me that a great deal of\\n      chronic ill health may quite conceivably be due to the manipulations of\\n      our foods and to the artificial manuring of the ground in which many of\\n      them are grown. Experiments have been carried our proving that plants\\n      grown in soil enriched by natural manuring, are much less prone to\\n      diseases than those grown with the help of artificial chemical manures. It\\n      seems a fairly justified conclusion that vegetables grown under these\\n      artificial conditions may quite well be deficient in something necessary\\n      for our perfect health. It is therefore incumbent upon the physician to\\n      advocate whenever possible the ingestion of healthily grown foods in the\\n      widest sense of that term.\\n      \\n The same duty applies when we consider\\n      the great amount of drugging in which the community at large indulges by\\n      its excessive smoking, particularly when aggravated by the practice of\\n      inhaling, and by the continued and prolonged use of drugs for this or that\\n      symptom, too often, unfortunately, though not always, on the prescription\\n      of their medical advisors.\\n      \\n There is a great lack throughout the\\n      community of any real enthusiasm for perfect health: we are only too prone\\n      to be content to follow like sheep, the unintelligent and harmful\\n      practices of the majority of our fellows.\\n      \\n Similarly in the curative realm, we\\n      homoeopathic physicians have special obligations.\\n      \\n When considering our position vis-a-vis\\n      the rest of the profession, we must never lose sight of the fact that our\\n      approach to the sick individual is a much broader and more comprehensive\\n      one than that of the dominant school. This latter prides itself on its\\n      scientific approach to its problems. One must, however, always be on ones\\n      guard against being hypnotized by that word scientific. The scientific\\n      aspect of any phenomenon or problem dealing with humanity is only one\\n      limited aspect of that problem. To get a complete picture one must\\n      consider other aspect, such as the aesthetic, emotional, maybe religious,\\n      and above all, perhaps one might say embracing all, the philosophical\\n      approach. This complex approach to his patients problem is the one that\\n      the homoeopathic physician always strives to adopt, and so never loses\\n      sight of the ego of the patient, while at the same time not forgetting his\\n      physical make - up.\\n      \\n Because this approach of ours to our\\n      patients is a much broader and more comprehensive one than the much\\n      vaunted scientific aspect, which the dominant school has come to regard as\\n      the Ultima Thule of medicine, I deplore the oft - repeated request of some\\n      of my colleagues that we should forsake our philosophy and make our work\\n      as scientific as theirs. I do not mean to imply by this that we should\\n      neglect the scientific angle of our patients illness but we should always\\n      remember that is only one facet of our problem. That is why we take such\\n      pains to diagnose our patients personality with his reaction to his\\n      environment in addition to the physical diagnosis of the case in order to\\n      arrive at our prescription for his malady. In other words, we should\\n      endeavour to lead our dominant school colleagues to our way of thinking,\\n      rather than that we should adopt theirs.\\n      \\n At the same time must always remember\\n      that if our philosophy should seem at any time to contradict so - called\\n      scientific laws, we must re - examine our philosophy, and if necessary\\n      modify it, while at the same time remembering that many times in the past\\n      what have been regarded as laws have ultimately been proved not to be so.\\n      Thus it is evident that we must never relax our self - examination.\\n      \\n What shall be the role of the\\n      homoeopathic laity?\\n      \\n The first thing for them to remember is\\n      that we are living in a democratic country whose government is dependent\\n      on the goodwill of the governed, and that, if a sufficient number of\\n      voters desire a certain line of action, that line will be adopted by the\\n      government.\\n      \\n The second thought is that there are\\n      not nearly sufficient doctors practising Homoeopathy in Great Britain to\\n      satisfy the present demand, let alone any further increased demand in the\\n      future, for this line of treatment.\\n      \\n Does not this seem strange, having\\n      regard to the great advantage to humanity that Homoeopathy provides? Not\\n      if one looks below the surface and so finds the reason for this shortage.\\n      \\n Surely the most potent reason is that\\n      Homoeopathy is not taught in the official Medical Schools, either as a pre\\n      - or post - graduate study. The London University when asked to recognize\\n      the Royal London Homoeopathic Hospital as a post - graduate Medical\\n      School, refused on the plea that as Homoeopathy was not taught in the\\n      undergraduate Medical Schools, it could not find a place for it in its\\n      post - graduate curriculum.\\n      \\n It is, of course, nonsense to suggest\\n      that a graduate should pursue his studies only in those subject of which\\n      he had already obtained some knowledge in his undergraduate days and\\n      should not wish to obtain information on any new or extra subject.\\n      \\n The University Medical Shools are\\n      enabled to a great extent through Government grants. We must therefore\\n      find some way of influencing whatever Government be in power to bring\\n      pressure to bear upon the London University to remove this obstacle to the\\n      better health of the community at large. I am quite satisfied that once\\n      this academic recognition is obtained we shave many more post - graduate\\n      students of Homoeopathy.\\n      \\n I believe than in a democratic\\n      community, having a universal State Medical Service, it is the bounden\\n      duty of the Government to remove all obstacles to the peoples obtaining\\n      that form of medical treatment in which they have confidence. So long as\\n      Homoeopathy is denied its legitimate status, so long must be Government be\\n      deemed to b failing in its duty to the country.\\n      \\n If, however, we are to achieve this\\n      desirable object of full recognition, we must all, professional and laity,\\n      be fired with enthusiasm, not only for the abstract cause of Homoeopathy,\\n      but for being partners with our young Queen in delicating our lives to the\\n      community.\\n      \\n When we do this we shall help to make\\n      this second Elizabethan era one to be remembered throughout the ages to\\n      come as surpassing the first Elizabethan era in that it gained not so much\\n      the economic and political leadership of the world - though that is not to\\n      be despised - but showed the way to the most healthful and spiritual way\\n      of life that all the world look notice and followed suit.\\n      \\n To sum up, the Role of Homoeopathy, as\\n      I see it, is to humanize the practice of medicine. By that I mean it must\\n      bring the practice of medicine into line with a reasoned philosophy of\\n      life, restore to it its artistry and rid it of all unnecessary hazards. It\\n      is to do this, not from any abstract academic sense of superiority, but in\\n      order the years to come are not those of merely another reign, but to\\n      ensure a veritable Renaissance, starting with the second Elizabethan era\\n      in which Great Britain will take its rightful place in the comity of\\n      nations as the pathfinder to a way of life for which posterity will be\\n      able to say \"Thank God for Queen Elizabeth the Second and her\\n      peoples.'\n",
      " 'Tresorie - Roentgenometric Pelvimetry [Roentgenometric Pelvimetry]\\n CHARLES W.PERKINS, M.D.\\n      \\n Norwalk, Conn\\n      \\n FOR some time the x-ray has been used\\n      to advantage in diagnosis of multiple pregnancy, position of fetus and\\n      fetal abnormalities. However, it has been only the past four or five years\\n      that any definite information has been obtained by roentgenographic\\n      methods of diagnoses in pelvimetry.\\n      \\n At the present time we are convinced\\n      that only by means of roentgenographs can be true proportions of the\\n      superior strait be determined, and that the ordinary external methods of\\n      Pelvimetry are not only occasionally misleading but proportionately\\n      inaccurate.\\n      \\n The present communication deals with\\n      the method of Herbert Thomas of Yale University. This method was developed\\n      in cooperation with the late Dr. W.A. Lafield, who was Professor of\\n      Roentgenology at the Yale Medical School.\\n      \\n Some of the reasons why roentgen\\n      pelvimetry has not been more universally adopted are probably due to the\\n      following factors.\\n      \\n (1) The majority of women will be\\n      delivered normally, whether or not pelvic measurements are made.\\n      \\n (2) The medical profession does not\\n      readily accept a new method after an established satisfactory routine has\\n      been in use.\\n      \\n (3) A new method of diagnosis incurs\\n      added expense.\\n      \\n (4) The present methods, although\\n      entirely speculative, are satisfactory in most cases.\\n      \\n (5) Roentgen pelvimetry cannot be\\n      performed by the obstetrician himself but requires the aid of a\\n      roentgenologist.\\n      \\n (6) The value of roentgenometric\\n      diagnosis is recent in origin and as yet not universally accepted.\\n      \\n If the knowledge of the size and shape\\n      of the pelvis is necessary to the practice of obstetrics, roentgen\\n      pelvimetry is a sound procedure, particularly in pre-emptors patients, and\\n      should and should be considered as an indispensable aid in these cases.\\n      \\n The method of Herbert Thoms as\\n      developed at Yale Medical School is not the only method. However, it can\\n      be classified as simple, accurate and rapid; being adaptable for use by\\n      other than experts in x-ray and obstetric diagnosis. As a technical\\n      procedure a well trained hospital technician can master its technic alter\\n      sufficient instruction.\\n      \\n Studies of recent years reveal the fact\\n      that external Pelvimetry fails to give uniform and accurate information in\\n      regard to the shape and size of the superior strait. This is often true of\\n      thin undersized individuals. In many patients of this type external\\n      measurements may suggest a contracted pelvis while the x-ray will show a\\n      relatively large pelvis with a subsequent natural labor and normal-sized\\n      child. On the other hand a stocky short person with similar external\\n      measurements will disclose a contracted pelvis which is an obstetric\\n      problem. Because of the apparent relationship between shortening of the\\n      transverse diameter and a secondary persistent occipito-posterior\\n      presentation, accurate information regarding this diameter is of clinical\\n      significance.\\n      \\n The observations of Thomas were made on\\n      twenty consecutive patients whose pelvis showed a relative or real\\n      shortening of the transverse diameter of the superior strait. In every\\n      instance a primary or secondary occipito posterior position was found\\n      after the patient was in labor. (Herbert Thoms, Surgery, Gynecology and\\n      Obstetrics, January, 1933). It therefore has been proved that an actual or\\n      relative shortening of a transverse diameter of the superior strait\\n      results in a limitation of space that is greater in the anterior than in\\n      the posterior half of the superior strait. Under these circumstances, when\\n      the head descends early in labor, the occiput is forced to rotate\\n      posteriorly.\\n      \\n The x-ray offers additional information\\n      in determining the size of the fetal head. It has been noted in x-ray\\n      examination of the unengaged fetal head that it lay with the transverse\\n      diameter of the superior strait, the occiput being either to the right or\\n      left; therefore, if roentgenogram of the patient is taken in the supine\\n      position with the fetus in the uterus, it will cast a shadow which is an\\n      enlarged profile of the head. The measurements of the occipital frontal\\n      diameter of the head can then be made. On numerous occasions this method\\n      of cephalometry, determining the diameter of the unmoulded head before and\\n      after cesarean section, has yielded accurate results. (Thomas, A.M.A.,\\n      February 24, 1934).\\n      \\n As experience increases in roentgen\\n      pelvimetry, the so-called labor test will be employed less. This, however,\\n      does not mean that the physician should not under estimate the importance\\n      of uterine contraction and the ability of the fetal head to mold. It has\\n      always followed that when something could be proved desirable in medicine\\n      for the better protection of the patient, such an advance would be\\n      demanded and eventually become routine. We may concede, therefore, that\\n      roentgen pelvimetry has a distinct place in the examination of every\\n      primiparous woman. In many instances, according to Thomas and others,\\n      external; measurements were normal but the x-ray examination revealed a\\n      contracted pelvis. On the other had, in certain patients whose external\\n      measurements suggested a cesarean section roentgen pelvimetry proved\\n      otherwise and they were subsequently delivered in a normal manner.\\n      \\n CENTIMETER GRID METHOD.\\n      \\n The procedure in this method may be\\n      summarized by stating the following:.\\n      \\n (1) The patient is placed on the\\n      roentgenographic table in the semi- recumbent position.\\n      \\n (2) The level of the superior strait\\n      above the sensitized film is established.\\n      \\n (3) The tube target is centered about\\n      five centimeters posterior to the symphysis, at thirty-two inches from the\\n      sensitized film, The exposure is made.\\n      \\n (4) The patient is removed from the\\n      table, the tube target and sensitized film remaining in situ.\\n      \\n (5) A lead plate, or centimeter grid,\\n      with perforations exactly one centimeter apart, is introduced into the\\n      same plane as that previously occupied by the superior strait and a second\\n      (flash) exposure is made on the same sensitized film as was used used in\\n      the previous exposure.\\n      \\n (6) Development of the film shows the\\n      outline of the superior strait and the shadows of the perforations, the\\n      assistance between which represents centimeters in the plane of the\\n      superior strait. The anteroposterior and transverse diameters of the\\n      superior strait in its use proportions may be drawn on centimeter-square\\n      paper by following the course of the shadow of the superior strait and\\n      transcribing it.\\n      \\n As this time I wish to express my\\n      thanks to Dr. Thoms for his personal advice and instruction which helped\\n      me to master the technic of his method.'\n",
      " 'Tresorie - NOTATU DIGNUM [Test Of A Homoeopath]\\n\\n Complaints are not unfrequently made\\n      that the homoeopathic materia medica is too vast for practical utility;\\n      that the schematised list of symptoms are unprofitable, if not impossible\\n      reading. I do not think so. Indeed, I think that the test of a genuine\\n      homoeopath might not unfairly be said to life in his capacity to read\\n      through a Schema with both profit and enjoyment because of the\\n      possibilities it reveals of dealing with cases occurring every day in\\n      practice.

      " 'Tresorie - THE EFFICACY OF THE VIBROMETER IN APPLYING VIBRATORY MASSAGE\\nIN AURAL DISEASES [Efficacy Of Vibrometer In Applying Vibratory Message In Aural\\nDisease]\\n\\n SINCE presenting my paper before the\\n      American Institute, in June of last year on \"Vibratory Motion as a\\n      Method of Massage in Aural Diseases,\" I have been using an instrument\\n      specially devised for that purpose called the \"vibrometer.\" This\\n      instrument is in shape like a banjo, and has four strings stretched across\\n      its length resting on a bridge, which sets upon a diaphragm. On each side,\\n      elevated above the diaphragm and supported by posts, are two horizontal\\n      bars, which support the mechanical appliances used for producing the\\n      various vibratory motions. This consists in what is called a yoke, in\\n      which revolves a shaft connected with the electro-motor by pulley-wheels\\n      and a belt. Behind the diaphragm is a shallow air-tight compartment,\\n      leading from which are rubber tubes that are inserted in the external\\n      auditory canal during treatment, consequently any vibratory motion of the\\n      diaphragm, which must necessarily be an inward and a corresponding outward\\n      movement, would be exactly reproduced upon the membrana tympani, as the\\n      confined air, not being able to escape, will undergo an alternate\\n      condensation and rarefication in the external auditory canal.\\n      \\n Every vibratory movement of the strings\\n      of the instrument is communicated to the diaphragm by means of the bridge\\n      upon which it rests. These strings by varying their tension and length can\\n      be regulated to give a high or low rate of vibration as desired, for\\n      instance, the heaviest string left at its original length adjusted to a\\n      slight tension may make about fifty vibratory motions to the second, while\\n      the highest string on the instrument adjusted to a high tension and\\n      clamped down to one-fourth its original length would probably make three\\n      thousand vibratory motions to the second.\\n      \\n In the centre of the diaphragm is an\\n      attachment which works on a lever, and when hit by the cam on the\\n      revolving shaft lifts the diaphragm to a considerable extent, causing a\\n      powerful effect on the membrana tympani. This attachment can be adjusted\\n      at four different leverages, which causes a modification or increase of\\n      its intensity and can be regulated at from one to twenty-five vibratory\\n      movements to the second. This is only used in very bad cases and for not\\n      more than five minutes continuously.\\n      \\n The instrument which I have been\\n      describing in an improvement on the first manufactured, and as far as I\\n      know, is the only one which offers the same facilities for applying this\\n      method of massage. The class of patients in my experience who are\\n      generally benefited from the first, are those in which the mucous membrane\\n      lining the tympanic cavity and Eustachian tubes is in a hypertrophic\\n      condition. The membrana tympani are depressed, opaque, and thickened. They\\n      usually complain of a stiffed sensation in the ears, with a great deal of\\n      tinnitus aurium, and that their hearing is worse during a cold. In cases\\n      where the mucous membranes are atrophied with a large external auditory\\n      canal perfectly dry and Eustachian tubes patulous, and generally very\\n      little tinnitus, this or no other treatment has done very much good in the\\n      majority of cases, and in looking ever my records I find that only about\\n      five per cent. have been relieved, while in the before-mentioned cases the\\n      good results reach at least seventy-five per cent. In treating persons, I\\n      always select the rate of vibration which corresponds in pitch, if\\n      possible, to that caused by the diseased condition of the ears. If there\\n      is no tinnitus to guide me, I find whether the patient can hear a high or\\n      low sound better; if it is a low sound, a high rate of vibration is used\\n      in treatment, and vice versa, A point which I would like to explain here\\n      is this: It is not necessary that the sound from the instrument should be\\n      of the same quality of the tinnitus experienced by the patient, but merely\\n      the same pitch. for instance, if a banjo, where one of the strings was\\n      adjusted when sounded to produce a certain note, and a musical instrument\\n      of any other kind, whose quality of tone was entirely different, was made\\n      to sound the same note in a room, the string on the banjo would vibrate in\\n      sympathy, which has been proven by experiment, any other note, no matter\\n      how loud, would have no effect. Another point is in the way the strings of\\n      the vibrometer are set in motion. On the revolving shaft is a wheel\\n      projecting from which are metallic picks which hit the string it is\\n      adjusted over. It does not make any difference in the number of vibratory\\n      motions per second, whether the string is hit fast or slow, but at the\\n      time the string is first hit the intensity is greater than it is just\\n      before being hit again, and as the motion of the wheel is perfectly\\n      rhythmic, revolving so many times to the second, it has just as good an\\n      effect as if the intensity during the fraction of a second did not vary at\\n      all. The idea of using vibratory motion, as I have said before, originated\\n      within my mind some years ago, and later put into practical operation, and\\n      as far as I know, was the first to lay before the profession in a\\n      scientific manner, this method of massage.\\n      \\n I have found that when two of the\\n      strings upon the vibrometer were regulated in such a way that when both\\n      were set in vibration at the same time, producing the sensation of a\\n      harmonious sound, the effect in some cases on the tinnitus was especially\\n      beneficial, relieving, where the various kinds of vibrations produced by a\\n      single string failed. Sub-acute cases of deafness, accompanied by tinnitus\\n      aurium, are quickly relieved, as the following case will illustrate:.\\n      \\n Mrs. M. Young, married lady, aet. 26,\\n      called at my office, April 1, 1893, complaining of partial deafness and\\n      tinnitus aurium. She had a stuffed sensation, or as if cotton had been\\n      packed in the external auditory canal. She says the tinnitus was so\\n      annoying as to prevent sleep. On examination, found considerable\\n      retraction of the membrana tympani, and hearing for the watch, on the\\n      right side five inches, on the left, seven inches. The Eustachian tube\\n      were partially closed, which made inflation somewhat difficult, giving\\n      slight relief. I used several of the vibrations on the different strings\\n      without immediate benefit.\\n      \\n April 4th.-She came again, and reported\\n      that no improvement had taken place. I again inflated her ears, after\\n      which she sat down to the vibrometer. The central attachment was used with\\n      considerable force continuously for four minutes, after which she declared\\n      that the tinnitus had entirely ceased in the right ear, and greatly\\n      modified in the left; the hearing for the watch had increased for both\\n      ears to fourteen inches, and the stuffed sensation had almost entirely\\n      disappeared. On inspection of the membrana tympani, found them\\n      comparatively very slightly retracted. On April 8th, found improvement had\\n      continued, when the same treatment was used for three minutes; after which\\n      she declared herself completely relieved of the tinnitus and stuffed\\n      sensation, with hearing powerfully restored. Saw her again on April 13th,\\n      when she declared the good results from last treatment to have still\\n      continued.\\n      \\n I find that in the majority of cases,\\n      when the strings of the instrument are used it is only necessary to strike\\n      them lightly with the friction wheel. In vibrating the heavy string, I\\n      generally set the bridge back behind the central attachment, and adjusting\\n      the motor in such way that the belt is at a considerable tension, so that\\n      the pulley-wheel revolves slowly. I also generally use this adjustment\\n      when setting in motion two strings at one time. The principle of this\\n      method of treatment embraces two essential features which to my mind makes\\n      this system of massage the only scientific one applicable to the membrana\\n      tympani and its associate sound-conducting parts. Message is the\\n      application of motion to disease, and its scientific administration\\n      consists of its application in a systematic manner. In applying massage in\\n      aural diseases, it is necessary to produce a to-and-fro movement of the\\n      membrana tympani, and, if possible, by a force which is harmless and at\\n      the same time effective. The vibrometer fulfils these conditions. Any of\\n      the strings on the instrument that may be set in motion by the\\n      friction-wheel, will produce a certain number of vibratory movements to\\n      the second of time, and the movements of the central attachment are also\\n      measured. What could be more systematic than this? The motions of the\\n      membrana tympani were intended by nature to its vibratory, and as the\\n      vibrometer generates measured motion, and these motions are vibratory,\\n      theoretically we have a scientific and effective method of massage in\\n      aural diseases; and, as demonstrated practically by the use of the\\n      vibrometer, we have in fact a great scientific advance over all previous\\n      methods. Since the introduction of this treatment in aural diseases, it\\n      makes possible a more or less benefit in cases of deafness heretofore\\n      considered hopeless, and has opened up the field for the treatment of\\n      aural diseases to such an extent that the number of deaf patients seeking\\n      relief at the aurist\\'s hands will at least double itself.\\n      \\n DISCUSSION.\\n      \\n H.C. HOUGHTON, M.D.: Dr. Garey\\'s\\n      admirable paper gives us the description of the vibrometer, an instrument\\n      devised under his personal direction and inspection, for the purpose of\\n      applying massage to the ear. It is the only instrument of the kind on the\\n      market, so far as I am aware, and after a somewhat prolonged use of it, I\\n      am prepared to recommend the latest production of the vibrometer company.\\n      \\n This instrument is a decided\\n      improvement over the instrument first sent out, and is capable of\\n      producing a most profound effect upon the drum-head and ossicula; indeed,\\n      upon the entire auditory apparatus. I am able to confirm Dr. Garey\\'s\\n      statement of the effect of high and low vibrations us regards treatment.\\n      \\n I have also been very much interested\\n      in the use of stringed or reed instruments for diagnosis, and find that we\\n      can detect any abnormal sensitiveness of the auditory nerve to high or low\\n      tones. Some patients are extremely sensitive to all tones, high or low;\\n      others to high tones and not to low tones; others, conversely. Again, in\\n      some instances, there is a peculiar sensitiveness to single tones or to\\n      discords produced by sounding the note and half-note at the same time.\\n      Under the action of the central attachment of the vibrometer this\\n      sensitiveness is modified, the sensitiveness to high tones disappearing\\n      and being replaced by a low tone or, conversely, under treatment, a low\\n      tone disappears and a high tone is established, temporarily, at least.\\n      Again, in cases of recent origin, treatment will substitute an undefined\\n      rushing sound for a definite musical tone, either high or low, and later,\\n      the treatment will abolish this, the patient being relieved of this\\n      intensely annoying symptom. In some cases, with this relief, there is an\\n      improvement in the audition; in other cases, no improvement follows.\\n      \\n I confess to the domination of the\\n      material over my mind in my earlier experience with massage, and I think\\n      the inclination of operators will be to use a far greater degree of power\\n      than is necessary. I therefore notice with great satisfaction Professor\\n      Garey\\'s remark that \"the object should be to produce a to-and-fro\\n      motion to the membrana tympani, and, if possible, by a force which is\\n      harmless and at the same time effective.\" I would hardly say\\n      \"to-and-fro motion of the drum-head,\" because I think that the\\n      expression is liable to perpetuate the motion which is fixed in the minds\\n      of most physiologists, that the drum-head moves as a whole, with a\\n      to-and-fro motion.\" That is true under the influence of the Politzer,\\n      Siegle\\'s otoscope and similar instruments; but it certainly does not so\\n      move in the ordinary function of audition, but stands as the iris does in\\n      the eye, as an adjustor, a regulator of sound-force; in some sense as the\\n      iris does in its relation with the lens, to adjust, regulate and direct\\n      the essential force, and the vibration of the drum-head is at every node;\\n      every portion receives impressions that are converted into molecular\\n      disturbances of varying lengths, according as they are produced upon the\\n      stiff and unyielding portions of the drum-head at the periphery, along the\\n      manubrium, or in the more attenuated and easily-yielding portions which\\n      the between these two areas. Not only so, but these impulses are\\n      communicated to the contained air of the tympanum, and make their\\n      impression upon the acoustic nerve through the round window synchronously\\n      with the impression made through the ossicula.\\n      \\n This whole subject widens before my\\n      mind in such a way that one might wish himself twenty years and at liberty\\n      to devote himself to a term of research in acoustics, such as is offered\\n      only in the technical schools of the continent of Europe.\\n      \\n WM. R. KING, M.D.: In discussing Dr.\\n      Garey\\'s paper I shall begin by saying that his methods have been closely\\n      followed by me since the beginning of his experiments, owing to the fact\\n      that I have been greatly interested in the treatment of deafness and\\n      tinnitus by means of sound waves or by aural massage since 1887, and have\\n      experimented and treated many cases by this method since then, though with\\n      crude and unsatisfactory instruments. Since using the vibrometer-which,\\n      after much study and experimentation, is now presented to the profession\\n      in practical shape-I have undoubtedly increased my percentage of good\\n      results.\\n      \\n I don\\'t believe I am over-sanguine or\\n      carried away by interest in this method, and believe I can rightly\\n      appreciate that this does not offer us a panacea or cure-all for auditory\\n      ailments, and hope I may always be ready to see the failures and to strive\\n      to find methods or remedies to reach some of them.\\n      \\n In speaking of the application of the\\n      instrument, I wish to call attention to the central attachment or post foe\\n      vibrations. Dr. Garey has not given it as much attention in the paper as\\n      it deserves. It is very useful as a general means of aural massage,\\n      rougher in nature and more general in application than the strings which\\n      help to make up the instrument. I often use it before applying the\\n      \"similar found\" to a given case, as a species of gymnastics, to\\n      stimulate secretion and motion in the conducting apparatus of the ear,\\n      viz., membrana tympani and ossicles. In most cases-in fact, in all-where\\n      tinnitus is present, I follow this up immediately by the nearest approach\\n      to the similar pitch obtainable.\\n      \\n I agree thoroughly with Dr. Garey, that\\n      the best results are achieved in cases accompanying hypertrophic catarrh,\\n      and that the least benefit is apparent in cases of atrophic nature.\\n      \\n Regarding the method of treatment in\\n      the absence of tinnitus, my experience the does not coincide with that of\\n      the author of the paper entirely; I do not feel that as yet we have any\\n      safe rule to guide us. My method has been to try the numerous sounds and\\n      variations the of until I find the one that seems to give the best\\n      immediate results, or that the patient himself will speak of as very\\n      penetrating and powerful )though not necessarily loud and heavy).\\n      \\n It seems almost impossible at present\\n      to simulate all the qualities of tone as they occur in the ears of those\\n      suffering with tinnitus; in fact, it would appear to be unnecessary.\\n      However, it seems advantageous and quite necessary to secure the closest\\n      simulation of pitch, thus in many cases soon obliterating annoying\\n      tinnitus and improving hearing powers.\\n      \\n The arrangement permitting of the\\n      picking of two strings simultaneously adds decidedly the usefulness of the\\n      instrument, as it increases the range of pitch as well as varying the\\n      quality of tones procurable, thereby decidedly enlarging our field of\\n      application.\\n      \\n The force used for creating the message\\n      or gymnastics of the membrana tympani and the ossicles-viz, vibratory\\n      force or sound- carefully and scientifically applied, is nature\\'s remedy,\\n      because it is adapted by nature, and is the only force which can rightly\\n      or safely be applied to these delicate portions of this complex organ of\\n      hearing.\\n      \\n A startling commentary on this subject\\n      is the array of cases benefited who have been relegated to the shelf by\\n      ancient and modern otology; cases declared unhelpable have been vastly\\n      improved. Pray, make no mistake; I did not say all cases.\\n      \\n It may be interesting to hear the\\n      latest regarding the instrument which was first invented for the\\n      application of this method of aural massage Mr. E.J. Godman, the inventor\\n      and patentee, is constantly on the lookout, and always striving for\\n      improvements to his machine. He has made many that you all know of. Permit\\n      me to report a few so recent they have not yet left the factory.\\n      \\n First.-The machine has been taken from\\n      its case, and is now mounted on a solid stand or table of oak, being set\\n      below the level, or so that the face of the instrument is just level with\\n      the face of the table. This is all supported by rigid, solid metal legs,\\n      which absolutely prevent foreign vibrations.\\n      \\n Second.-The motor has been removed from\\n      its little shelf and relegated below the table. I t can be placed upon a\\n      box on the floor, a shelf against the wall, or, better yet, a shelf\\n      solidly attached to the metal supports of the table. A belt goes up\\n      through an aperture to a wheel on a shaft, the other extremity of which\\n      carries a wheel with a rubber tire (a friction wheel), which in its\\n      revolution, being in contact with a larger flat- surfaced wheel on the\\n      main shaft of the instrument, turns this in harmony with itself. This\\n      arrangement does away with the necessity of shifting the motor each time\\n      you wish to shift the carriage from one string to another- a consummation\\n      to be devoutly thankful for. The removal of the motor from the instrument\\n      as at present attached will recommend itself to all who have used the\\n      vibrometer, a great amount of undesirable jar being thus avoided.\\n      \\n Third.-Ratchet keys capable of very\\n      fine adjustment of tension of strings are now provided for the instrument.\\n      \\n Fourth.-A rheostadt or resistance-coil\\n      is now to be placed beneath the table between the storage battery and the\\n      switch, by this means enabling us to control the speed and number of\\n      revolutions to a nicety.\\n      \\n Other, though comparatively minor,\\n      improvements are being made, and others are contemplated, as, for\\n      instance, the substitution of a roughly corrugated rubber band for the\\n      picker on the wheel, thereby getting rid of the metallic sound of the\\n      picker on the wire strings.\\n      \\n I have experimented with a number of\\n      appliance for the production of the sounds and pitches that I have\\n      required, but I always fall back on the vibrometer, especially as at\\n      present constructed, for satisfactory work and results.\\n      \\n This instrument may be, and probably\\n      is, as yet, in its infancy. It, and the method it applies, can only be\\n      perfected by constant work and experimentation both on the part of the\\n      profession and of the manufacturers. Each improvement we can suggest, if\\n      it only should serve as a means of helping one solitary case, would be\\n      well worth our while.\\n      \\n The experiments being made by different\\n      methods for treating deafness by sound waves is indicative of the interest\\n      the profession has taken in the matter. It is indicative of a lack of\\n      something in our usual armamentarium which is greatly longed for by\\n      patient and doctor; that is, the means for making the deaf hear and for\\n      relieving distressing tinnitus. There has been a dearth in this direction,\\n      and perhaps there still is, but I believe fully that we have in aural\\n      massage by vibratory force a decided acquisition at our hands.\\n      \\n E. H. LINNELL., M.D.: I would simply\\n      like to ask Dr. King how long he uses the instrument, and whether he uses\\n      it according to the deafness.\\n      \\n DR. KING: Yes, decidedly. In an intense\\n      case of deafness I would have to use it a great deal longer. The central\\n      attachment I never carry over three or five minutes, and the whole\\n      treatment I don\\'t think is over carried over twenty or twenty-five minutes\\n      in one case, and usually averages from ten to fifteen.\\n      \\n HAROLD WILSON, M.D.: I have only to\\n      suggest, what I have elsewhere called attention to, the possibility of\\n      another mechanical device for securing vibratory motion. It is well known\\n      that in the make and break of a current of electricity, in the circuit of\\n      which there is a telephone, we get an influence upon the make and break of\\n      the current in the telephone. Now, it is a simple matter with which these\\n      makes and breaks are made as to obtaining any number of vibration that you\\n      wish. You may, by a mechanical device of some rotary motion, if you\\n      choose, make and break the current as rapidly as you please until you have\\n      reached several thousand vibrations a second, or you may even make the\\n      vibrations so slow us to be easily counted. The application of this\\n      suggestion has been put in force in my own practice, more or less, in the\\n      use of the telephone as connected with the induction-coil ordinary\\n      battery. The more intense the current, the more intense the sound. You can\\n      easily see that it is mere question of mechanics to secure these two\\n      sounds-intensity of vibration and rapidity of vibration. I will say,\\n      furthermore, that it has this advantage. There is no noise in the office,\\n      which I think is not altogether true of the vibrometer. I would suggest\\n      that so far as the vibrometer is concerned, if it could be made to be\\n      noiseless to anybody but the patient, it would be a decided improvement.\\n      In that respect the telephone is a decided improvement, because there is\\n      no noise except to the patient, because the noise is right at the ear of\\n      the patient. If I were seeking for a perfected instrument in this line, I\\n      would go outside of the banjo idea. As we have the most perfect writing\\n      machines, which have no connection with the ordinary method of writing,\\n      and sewing machines, which have no connection with sewing by hand, so it\\n      occurs to me that possibly the securing of he vibratory motion upon the\\n      ears might be obtained in a totally different way from that which you get\\n      when you listen to the drum of the guitar or an ordinary musical\\n      instrument, and I would suggest that the make and break of a telephone\\n      open a very fruitful field for mechanical experimentation.\\n      \\n H.C. HOUGHTON, M.D.: In my study of\\n      this subject I made the acquaintance of Mr. Bernhardt, of New York City,\\n      who is a personal friend of Mr. Emil Berliner, the inventor of the Emil\\n      Berliner Telephone, which is the instrument by which the Bell Telephone\\n      Company maintain their monopoly at present. Mr. Berliner is the inventor\\n      of the graphophone, and has, I think, covered this whole matter which Dr.\\n      Wilson has mentioned. As ordinary Bell telephone receiver is put into the\\n      circuit of an ordinary induction machine, and you can use it just as the\\n      English people use the audiometer, and as you remove the coil you modify\\n      the vibrations, which is covered with another disk and a tube, and that\\n      tube covered with a stethoscope tube, which is the same as we use for the\\n      phonograph or vibrometer, and, as Dr. Wilson has suggested, you can modify\\n      the intensity, and of course the whole matter is adjusted by the\\n      attachment of the cord, so that you can have fine vibrations. The\\n      intensity of the vibrations is regulated by the distance to which you\\n      uncover the cord. The only difficulty in the adjustment is that it has\\n      been so severe that it is really uncomfortable, and the noise of the\\n      instrument is reduced to the minimum for office use.\\n      \\n A.B. NORTON, M.D.: I will also add that\\n      in regard to the objection Dr. Wilson makes to the noise, there is no\\n      doubt it is an annoying thing in the office, and in that line I have some\\n      men at work on my suggestion. We are devising another machine, or\\n      instrument, which is to be entirely enclosed in a cabinet, so there will\\n      be no noise whatever in the room if it is made a success. The idea is a\\n      little crude, and I am quite uncertain whether it will amount to anything\\n      or not. Then, in the line of what Dr. King was speaking in regard to Mr.\\n      Goodwin-he called, at New York, to see me last week. I made two little\\n      suggestion to him, which I think would be in line with his advancement.\\n      One is the number of the picks. The present vibrometer has four picks I\\n      suggest the experiment of trying twelve or sixteen picks, which will make\\n      a more continuous sound; it may be of some value. Then, in regard to\\n      regulating the speed of the machine: you regulate that now by a series of\\n      buttons, so as to get three different speeds. We will have a very slight,\\n      intermediate speed, and a very rapid speed. My experience with the\\n      vibrometer is especially favorable. I think the idea is in the right\\n      direction, and it is simply a matter of instrumentation.']\n",

Dietary sources of vitamin C include fruits and vegetables, particularly citrus fruits such as oranges.Severe deficiency of vitamin C causes scurvy. Although rare, scurvy results in severe symptoms and can cause death. People with scurvy are treated with vitamin C and should be under medical supervision.Many uses for vitamin C have been proposed, but evidence of benefit in scientific studies is lacking. In particular, research on asthma, cancer, and diabetes remains inconclusive, and a lack of benefit has been found for the prevention of cataracts or heart disease.The use of vitamin C in the prevention or treatment of colds remains controversial. Extensive research has been conducted. Overall, vitamin C lacked an effect on the development of colds and on cold symptoms. However, the duration of the cold shortened slightly. Notably, people living in extreme circumstances, including soldiers in the subarctic, skiers, and marathon runners, had a 50% decrease in the risk of developing a cold. This area merits additional research and may be of particular interest to athletes or people in the military.'\n",

The strongest evidence supporting the use of melatonin is for delayed sleep phase syndrome, insomnia in children and the elderly, jet lag, and sleep problems in people with behavioral, developmental, or mental disorders. The weakest evidence in support of melatonin is for work shift sleep disorder. Good evidence in support of melatonin for other uses is lacking.New drugs that block the effects of melatonin are being developed. These include BMS-214778 and luzindole, and they may have uses in various disorders.'\n",
      " 'Black cohosh is popular as an alternative to hormonal therapy in the treatment of menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes, mood disturbances, excessive sweating, palpitations, and vaginal dryness. Several studies have reported black cohosh may improve menopausal symptoms for up to one year, although the evidence is mixed.The mechanism of action of black cohosh remains unclear. Research suggests that there may be no direct effects on estrogen receptors, although this is an area of active controversy.Safety and efficacy beyond one year have not been proven. Reports suggest the safety of short-term use, including in women with menopausal symptoms for whom estrogen replacement therapy is not suggested. Nonetheless, caution is advised until better-quality safety data are available. There have been reports of liver damage and higher lead levels in the blood from black cohosh. Use of black cohosh in high-risk populations (such as in women with a history of breast cancer) should be under the supervision of a licensed healthcare professional.'\n",
      " 'Beta-carotene is a carotenoid. Carotenoids are red, orange, or yellow, fat-soluble compounds. These compounds are naturally present in many fruits, grains, oils, and vegetables. Alpha, beta, and gamma carotene are considered provitamins because they can be converted to active vitamin A.Commercially available beta-carotene is man-made or taken from palm oil, algae, or fungi. Beta-carotene is converted to retinol, which is essential for vision and growth.Studies in humans show that beta-carotene has promising use for oral leukoplakia (pre-cancerous mouth lesions) and for sunburn. However there was a lack of benefit for sun damaged skin, mole prevention, heart disease risk, infection with H. Pylori, cataract prevention, diabetes, and stroke.Research shows that beta-carotene increased the risk of bladder, lung, stomach, and prostate cancer. Also the general incidence of cancer in asbestos workers, smokers, or high risk individuals increased. Additionally, some research suggested increased risk of heart disease and death with beta-carotene supplementation.'\n",
      " 'L-arginine was first isolated in 1886, reportedly from the extract of a lupine (Lupinus spp.) seedling. Lupinus is a genus in the legume (Fabaceae) plant family.Arginine is an amino acid normally made by the body. Arginine is also found in many foods that have protein.Arginine becomes nitric oxide (a blood vessel-widening agent called a vasodilator) in the body. Early evidence suggests that arginine may help treat medical conditions that improve with increased vasodilation. These conditions include chest pain, atherosclerosis (clogged arteries), heart disease, heart failure, erectile dysfunction, peripheral vascular disease, and headaches from blood vessel swelling).Arginine also triggers the body to make protein and has been studied for healing wounds, bodybuilding, enhancing sperm production, and preventing tissue wasting in people with critical illnesses. However, caution is warranted. Arginine use was associated with death in some people with heart conditions. Caution is also needed when using arginine to treat pre-eclampsia (high blood pressure in pregnancy).Arginine hydrochloride has been used to treat metabolic alkalosis. This use should be under the supervision of a qualified healthcare professional.'\n",
      " 'Flaxseed and flaxseed oil (or linseed oil) are rich sources of the essential fatty acid alpha-linolenic acid (ALA). In the body, some ALA is converted to omega-3 fatty acids.Lignans are a type of plant hormone similar to estrogen. The lignan components of flaxseed (not flaxseed oil) may possess antioxidant properties and alter estrogen activity.As a source of fiber, flaxseed (not flaxseed oil) has laxative properties. In large doses, or when taken without enough water, flaxseed may cause bowel obstruction. The effects of flaxseed on blood sugar levels are unclear.Flaxseed oil contains only the ALA component of flaxseed and not the fiber or lignan components. Therefore, flaxseed oil may share the potential cholesterol-lowering properties of flaxseed, but not the proposed laxative or anticancer abilities.'\n",

      " 'Tresorie - The Present Status of Radiation in the Treatment of Malignant\\nConditions [Present Status Of Radiation in the Treatment Of Malignant\\nConditions]\\n ISIDORE ARONS, M.D.\\n      \\n New York, N.Y.\\n      \\n AT A meeting of the American Medical\\n      Association recently held in Cleveland, Dr. Joseph C.Bloodgood, in\\n      discussing a paper on radiation therapy, said that \"report at my\\n      clinic told me that 49 per cent of the patients previously operated on in\\n      the clinic now to for radiotherapy. This is based on results. They are not\\n      hopeless cases; they are still hopeful and they get well under\\n      radiotherapy. This has happened during the last three years, not because I\\n      have changed any but because the method of radiotherapy has changed. A\\n      great change has taken place. First of all, radium and x-rays are no\\n      longer looked on a last resort.\".\\n      \\n The foregoing bears witness to the\\n      progress made in the field radiation therapy. The manufacture of more\\n      adequate apparatus and the improved technic in its use reflect this\\n      improvement. Machines are used generally delivering twenty to thirty\\n      milliamperes of current at 200 K.V., while machines operating at 750 to\\n      1,000 200 K.V., using lower milliamperes, have been installed in several\\n      places in this country. Since the question of increased voltages began to\\n      dominate the field, machines operating at 400 to 600 K.V., using sealed\\n      tubes, have been manufactured in this country as well as on the been\\n      manufactured in this country as well as on the continent. This higher\\n      powered machines occupy little more space than the usual 200 K.V. machine.\\n      \\n The effectiveness of these stronger\\n      radiations is thought to be due to (1) the increased penetration and its\\n      consequently larger percentage depth doses, (2) the supposed higher\\n      selective action of short have length radiation on malignant cells, and\\n      (3) greatly increased x-ray output. Clinics using super-voltages report\\n      that clinical results are somewhat better than those secured through the\\n      use of the lesser voltage machine.\\n      \\n Experimental effort, from the physical\\n      and biologic point of view, has been exerted to establish to standard\\n      basis for radiotherapy since Roentgens discovery thirtyfive years ago, and\\n      its application five years later. Radiotherapists have only recently begun\\n      to understand the principles of clinical application or radiotherapy in\\n      the treatment of malignant conditions.\\n      \\n Regaud selected the rabbits testicle\\n      for his experiments because its histologic cellular structure was highly\\n      sensitive to radiation, containing cells which are in a state of active\\n      mitosis resembling that of malignant tissue. In 1922, Regaud reported that\\n      of malignant, tissue. In 1922, Regaud reported that it was impossible to\\n      sterilize the testicle by a single dose of radiation without causing\\n      serious damage to the overlying skin. The dose required to produced such\\n      radio necrosis was equivalent to about three radionecrosis was equivalent\\n      to about three erythemas when administered in one dose. However, by\\n      dividing the dose in such a manner as to prolong the treatment over a\\n      period of fourteen days, a total dose of about five erythemas could be\\n      given causing complete sterilizations without damage to the skin. Thus it\\n      is seen that by prolonging the time of treatment the cutaneous dose could\\n      be increased nearly 50 per cent without causing necrosis.\\n      \\n The above experiments were reported,\\n      and the same results determined, by Schinz and Slotopolsky in 1926, and\\n      again by Regaud and Ferroux in 1927. These experiments formed the\\n      foundation for the clinical studies of Pfahler (America), Hohlfelder\\n      (Germany) and Coutard (France), who have swung the pendulum from massive\\n      radiation, as advocated by the German school, to that of the protected\\n      fractional dose method. Results have been achieved by this method which\\n      are superior to previously reported; these are obtained by the improved\\n      method of administering a large dose to the (3 days) without causing\\n      destructive effects to the surroundings normal structure (or cancer bed);\\n      its effect are rather biologic than physical. The clinical application of\\n      the method of radiation by Pfahler, Countard, and Berven (Sweden) in the\\n      treatment of cancer of the tonsil, pharynx and larynx and have proved the\\n      radio-sensitive properties of squamous carcinoma, previously considered\\n      incapable of of responding to radiation.\\n      \\n According to Coutard, the neoplasm is\\n      exposed to x-rays twice daily, giving a total dose of 350 r to400 r to two\\n      areas, using 190 to 200 k.v., four milliamperes, two millimeters of copper\\n      and three millimeters of aluminum filtration at a distance of fifty of\\n      sixty centimeters, for lesion of the head and neck. For deeply situated\\n      lesions, such as cancer of the uterus, the focal distance varies from 80\\n      to 100 centimeters, the area of the field for the head and neck conditions\\n      being only 50 to 100 square centimeters, while those of the lower abdomen\\n      require on an average of 250 to 300 square centimeters. For the\\n      sterilization of the radio-sensitive squamous carcinomatous growth, a\\n      depth dose of 3,000 r to 4,000 r is given, while stronger dose is\\n      necessary for the radio-resistant tumors.\\n      \\n In the course of treatment of principle\\n      guides a radio reaction of the covering epithelium and the radio reaction\\n      of the cancer cells. The radio reaction of the cutaneous epithelium is\\n      called \"radio epidermitis.\"characterized by loss of epithelial\\n      layers and denudation of the dermis. The reaction of the mucous membrane ,\\n      called \"radio epithelitis,\" manifests itself by loss of the\\n      epithelial layer sand denudation of the mucous membrane, epithelial layers\\n      and denudation of the corium which becomes covered by a fibrinous and\\n      false membrane; of clear. The duration of both describe radio reactions is\\n      six weeks. Each appears at the beginning of three weeks and disappears at\\n      the beginning of the ninth week.\\n      \\n Should the total or daily dose or the\\n      intensity per minute be too high, or the filtration or the tension too\\n      low, the cancer bed would be modified. the nutrition of the malignant\\n      cells becomes impaired The cellular radio- sensitivity, which seems to be\\n      linked up not only with the mitosis of the cell but above all with the\\n      activity of their interchange with the cell but above all with the\\n      activity of their interchange with the surrounding normal structures,\\n      becomes diminished and at times suppressed. The cancer cells become\\n      incentive to radiation. This phenomenon is called \"radio-\\n      vaccination\" by Regaud.\\n      \\n Observation of clinical facts shows\\n      that changes in the surrounding normal tissue result from excessive daily\\n      doses and intensity per minute per minute causing radio resistance of the\\n      tissue. Conversely, radio- sensitivity would be prolonged with a smaller\\n      daily dosage and the resultant extended period.\\n      \\n Realizing that better results may be\\n      obtained by prolonged treatment, Coutard and his collaborators in the last\\n      few years have begun to extend the duration of treatment of certain\\n      so-called radio-resistant cancers from thirty to ninety days, giving weak\\n      daily doses in order of about 175, 220, 225 and 250 r per day, dividing\\n      the dose in two treatments. By this method he was able to cure a certain\\n      number of lesions on which he had not been able previously to obtain the\\n      same results, such as very differentiated epidermoid epithelioma invading\\n      the muscles and cartilages, glandular epithelioma of the breast ad the\\n      thyroid body, and special round celled epitheliomas of the upper part of\\n      the ethmoid and the adjacent sinuses. This mode of prolonged treatment not\\n      only controlled the condition locally but it lessened the frequency of\\n      metastasis.\\n      \\n When radiating a cancer of very\\n      embryonic, very radio-sensitive growths, the energy factor is predominant.\\n      The action of the x-rays seems to be direct and rapid; the treatment can\\n      be accomplished within fifteen to twenty days. The cells are destroyed and\\n      generally normal structures are affected very little. When radiating the\\n      less embryonic type of growths, the time of treatment should be longer.\\n      \\n Pursuing these general principles, I\\n      have adopted the Countard method with some slight modifications. The cures\\n      which I shall illustrate will show that the percentage of cures in a\\n      number of most dangerous epidermoid carcinomas has markedly increased and\\n      that some conditions formerly considered hopeless have been temporarily\\n      cured. In conclusion I wish to emphasize the following facts:.\\n      \\n (1) Cure of cancer by x-rays is still\\n      difficult and must not be entered into lightly and causally.\\n      \\n (2) Radiotherapy is just as radical in\\n      method as surgery, and requires great skill, judgment and experience.\\n      \\n (3) The cooperation of the pathologist\\n      and the radiotherapist is imperative for a proper estimate of the\\n      radio-sensitivity in relation to treatment of the lesion.\\n      \\n (4) Daily examination of the patient is\\n      necessary; modification of the normal structure and general reaction by\\n      the x-ray treatment sometimes appears to quickly that it is often\\n      necessary to diminish the daily dose or the size of the field in the\\n      course of treatment.\\n      \\n (5) There exists no fixed method of\\n      treatment, only a simple clinical treatment for each individual patient\\n      and for the special type of tumor..\\n      \\n (6) Improvement in roentgen apparatus\\n      of higher voltages, producing more penetrating rays, will permit a better\\n      relation between destruction of malignant cells and preservation of the\\n      supporting, and the radio sensitivity of the tumor may be prolonged.'\n",

This is the city where\\n      Homoeopathy was first introduced by Rajendra Lal Dutta of hallowed memory,\\n      who spent a princely fortune for dissemination of its principles and\\n      practice among his countrymen. This is the city where took place the\\n      dramatic conversion of one of the then medical luminaries of the first\\n      magnitude, to the practice of Homoeopathy under the influence of Rajendra\\n      Lal. I mean Dr. Mahendra Lal Sircar who became the high priest of\\n      Homoeopathy, spread its glory far and wide and gained thereby an\\n      international reputation for himself. This is the city where the\\n      celebrities of Homoeopathy like Dr. Berigny, Dr. Salzar, Dr. P.C.\\n      Majumdar, Dr. D. N. Roy. Dr. Younan, Dr. J.N. Majumdar, Dr. Baridbaran\\n      Mukherji, Dr. S.K. Nag, Dr. A.N. Mukherji, Dr. T.N. Palit, Dr. G.\\n      Dirghangi and a host of other talented physicians practised their\\n      profession with credit and success and held aloft the banner of\\n      Homoeopathy. This is the city where exist pioneer institutions for the\\n      teaching of Homoeopathy. This is the city wherefrom Homoeopathy has spread\\n      to all parts of India and its votaries are doing yeomans service for the\\n      good of the suffering humanity.\\n      \\n We are meeting this evening on a\\n      historic occasion and we have to arrive at decisions which might make or\\n      mar the future history of Homoeopathy in India. It may be that forces of\\n      disruption, destruction and obstruction are at work; it may be that self\\n      and vested interests seem to thwart the smooth progress of Homoeopathy; it\\n      may be that some may seem to play in the hands of the Powers that are not\\n      too sympathetic to the cause of Homoeopathy; it may be that the present\\n      seems to be chaotic and future of Homoeopathy dubious but great is truth\\n      indeed and will prevail. We should not lose heart or throw up the sponge.\\n      Tradition, authority, sectarianism, dogmatism are great obstacles on the\\n      way. But obstacles and difficulties are meant to be fought out and\\n      overcome. Strifes and dissensions, discords and disunities may hamper our\\n      progress but they are nonetheless signs of lifes activities. It is a good\\n      augury that the Homoeopathic profession is shaking off its age - long\\n      slumber and getting more and more conscious of its duties and obligation,\\n      its rights and privileges and of its short - comings and practical\\n      difficulties. The life of Hahnemann is there to encourage us; the\\n      masterful will of his dynamic spirit is there to inspire us to intensify\\n      our activities; his achievements are there to goad us to realise greater\\n      success; and his personality is always before us to take lessons from, in\\n      our life which as Swami Vivekananda puts it, is \"a process of\\n      unfolding and development of a being under circumstances tending to press\\n      it down.\"\\n      \\n That Homoeopathy is a scientific system\\n      of treatment, philosophically sound, logically unimpeachable, practically\\n      highly efficacious in curing the sick and cheap enough to suit the poor\\n      economic condition of the Indian masses - has become a much talked - of\\n      subject in the country. But why is it not spreading sufficiently and\\n      adequately in our motherland or in fact anywhere in the world? Why is our\\n      National Government not still keen on according official recognition to\\n      this superb system of healing art or providing ways and means for its\\n      development and diffusion? Why the public opinion is not gaining strength\\n      enough to put sufficient pressure on our Government to take interest in\\n      it? Why sufficient number of fully equipped Homoeopathic teaching\\n      institutions and hospitals are not growing to turn out adequate number of\\n      fully qualified Homoeopathic physicians in the country?\\n      \\n It is high time that we should draw the\\n      attention of the profession and the laity to provide answers to so many\\n      \"whys\" and to solve the pressing problems in the matter\\n      concerned. On a cursory view it becomes evident that the Homoeopathic\\n      profession, the people and the Government are each individually and\\n      collectively responsible for this impasse.\\n      \\n The so - called Allopathy still\\n      occupies the dominant place in any country, even in the land of birth of\\n      Homoeopathy. It is no wonder that Homoeopathy, being a discovery of merely\\n      a century and a half still lags behind its rival shool. But it is a wonder\\n      of wonders that Homoeopathy has already encompassed the whole world within\\n      such a short period since it was ushered into existence by Hahnemann.\\n      History of man reveals that nowhere a new truth was accepted by him easily\\n      and readily, obsessed as he is with conservatism, tradition, authority and\\n      vested interests. Nonetheless the triumphant march of Homoeopathy with a\\n      such a meteoric speed throughout the length and breadth of the world is a\\n      proof positive of the truth inherent in the system and phenomenal\\n      therapeutic efficacy of this healing art. It is one more glaring instance\\n      of mans love of truth against heavy odds that impede his progress at every\\n      step.\\n      \\n For the propagation of any new truth\\n      and its acceptance by man, in general, the first and foremost condition is\\n      the turning out of sufficient number of persons who have realised the\\n      truth and are adept in the practice of it. This involves establishment of\\n      a sufficient number of teaching institutions which will turn out experts\\n      in the science and art of Homoeopathy; and a sufficient number of\\n      Homoeopathic Hospital where, the efficacy of this system of treatment will\\n      be put to test.\\n      \\n Human knowledge is becoming\\n      unmanageably vast. The appearance of specialists has become indispensable.\\n      So special Hospitals for the treatment of specific types of diseases have\\n      sprung forth elsewhere, e.g. Tuberculosis Hospitals, Cancer Hospitals,\\n      Hospital for Tropical Diseases etc. Because of organisation of these\\n      hospitals people generally think of getting themselves treated in these\\n      institutions. As there are no fully - equipped general Homoeopathic\\n      Hospitals and not to speak of special Homoeopathic Hospitals and not to\\n      speak of special Homoeopathic Hospitals the result is Homoeopathy is not\\n      getting a fair chance of treating those diseases like tuberculosis,\\n      cancer, acute infectious diseases of epidemic type e.g., Small-pox,\\n      Cholera etc. on a large and organised scale. Consequently the general\\n      public cannot keep much faith in this treatment and mostly take recourse\\n      to homoeopathic treatment when the case is \"past all hope and past\\n      all surgery\". Hence the establishment of fully - equipped\\n      Homoeopathic institutions (College - cum - Hospitals) is an imperative\\n      necessity for enhancing the prestige of the Homoeopathic profession and\\n      for convincing the people about the therapeutic efficacy of this system of\\n      treatment. Is it not a pity that Homoeopathy once established its\\n      reputation by treating Cholera cases in this city and now nobody thinks of\\n      this treatment in Cholera cases and rushes the patient to the Allopathic\\n      Hospitals which are especially meant for these types of patients? How can\\n      we hope to gain ground under these circumstances?\\n      \\n The next great obstacle is the apathy\\n      and in many cases active antagonism of our Government, both at the Centre\\n      and at least in some of the State, towards Homoeopathy. The Government is\\n      under the thumb of its medical directorates which are solely manned by\\n      Allopathic doctors. The main reasons for the non - acceptance of the\\n      Homoeopathic system of treatment may be summed up in three words:\\n      tradition, authority and professionalism. Their psychology is easily\\n      understood if it is borne in mind that the conservative inertia of human\\n      mind attempts to reject any new thought will all the means at its\\n      disposal. Another reason is due to vested interests. Even a cursory glance\\n      at the history of origin and spread of Homoeopathy, enables one to find\\n      out that the opposition to this system from the start, was not scientific\\n      but rather of commercial nature on the part of the apothecaries who were\\n      afraid of losing their trade - profits. We regret to note that the Central\\n      Government have not yet implemented a single recommendation put forward by\\n      the Homoeopathic Enquiry Committee, Planning Commission. Third Health\\n      Ministers Conference, Ad Hoc Committee etc. though Homoeopathic Acts have\\n      been passed in the States of Bombay, U.P., Madhya Pradesh, Travancore -\\n      Cochin, Bihar etc. I is curious to note that W. Bengal is the only State\\n      where a Homoeopathic Bill has recently been thrown out by the State\\n      Government.\\n      \\n Another great obstacle is the\\n      psychology of the general mass of population who fail to adopt a proper\\n      philosophical attitude towards Homoeopathy and takes the Homoeopathic\\n      Therapeutic Law as great paradox contrary to common sense. Unless we can\\n      educate the public in the matter, we cannot hope to secure their whole -\\n      hearted support for this system of treatment.\\n      \\n Lack of enthusiasm for constructive\\n      works on the part of the Homoeopathic profession, the apathy of our\\n      Government and hesitancy on the part of the public to accept Homoeopathy\\n      are great obstacles to the spread of this system of treatment in the\\n      country. Unless this vicious circles is broken the progress of Homoeopathy\\n      is bound to be impeded. We have to fight on all fronts if we aspire to\\n      achieve victory in our battle for the cause of Homoeopathy and the\\n      suffering humanity.\\n      \\n But our first necessity as pointed out\\n      by the Soul of India expressing itself through Sri Aurobindo, is: If India\\n      is to survive and do her appointed work in the world, the youth of India\\n      should learn to think, to think on all subjects, to think independently,\\n      fruitfully, going to the heart of things, not stopped by their surface,\\n      free of pre - judgements, shearing sophism and prejudice asunder as with a\\n      sharp sword smiting down obscurantism of all kinds as with a mace of\\n      Bhima.\\n      \\n \"Let our brains no longer, like\\n      European infants, be swathed with swaddling clothes; let it have recover\\n      the free and unbound motion of the Gods, let it have not only the\\n      minuteness but the wide mastery and sovereignty natural to the intellect\\n      of Bharata and easily recoverable by it if it once accustomes itself to\\n      feel its own power and be convinced of its own worth.\\n      \\n \"The old fixed foundations have\\n      been broken up, we are tossing in the waters of a great upheaval and\\n      change.

      " 'Tresorie - SOME OBSERVATIONS ON NEURASTHENIA AND ITS TREATMENT\\n[Neurasthenia & Treatment]\\n\\n WHEN, thirty-five years ago, the writer\\n      first made the acquaintance of what is now called neurasthenia, it was\\n      known as spinal irritation, and the best of modern researches have been\\n      unable to give a better definition beyond a functional disturbance of the\\n      spinal and cerebral nerves, dependent on a morbid process, for which\\n      \"irritation\" is as proper a term as any. As deaths do not occur,\\n      autopsies throw no light on the subject. Briefly stated, neurasthenia,\\n      when observed from the beginning through its chronic course, has a period\\n      of prodromal symptoms followed by a protracted acute, and succeeded by a\\n      still more protracted chronic, state, between the end of which and the\\n      beginning of convalescence there is a very vague, often indiscernible,\\n      boundary line.\\n      \\n The prodromal symptoms are quite\\n      indefinite and very variable, pointing to nothing in particular. Loss of\\n      appetite, irregular sleep, excitability alternating with lassitude, etc.,\\n      are often overlooked, especially when the second stage-display of unusual\\n      mental and physical energy without subsequent fatigue- becomes apparent.\\n      This is often mistaken for a sign of unusually good health. When a young\\n      girl or mature woman, married or unmarried, feels that she can study ten\\n      hours a day and devote half of her night to pleasure or business; when\\n      besides much mental occupation she begins to rejoice in long walks without\\n      fatigue, that is the time when the mischief is going on without exciting\\n      timely suspicion. Relief is at last sought when the functional disorder of\\n      the nerves has gone to the opposite extreme, and becomes manifest in what\\n      is properly and popularly termed \"nervous prostration,\" when\\n      instead of having no sense of fatigue, the best bodily or mental effort\\n      seems intolerable, in grave cases rendering the patient a helpless being,\\n      completely dependent on the unremitting assistance of others whom she )it\\n      is usually a woman) rules with the inexorable power of the vis inertiae.\\n      \\n During this usually very protracted\\n      period of the disease convalescence usually sets in, but so imperceptibly\\n      that the physician alone can sometimes estimate its progress, which is\\n      unnoticeable to others towards whom the patient acts as she has for months\\n      or years. This is the time for action, too often delayed from motives of\\n      misplaced sympathy on the part of relatives and friends.\\n      \\n The affections is in many instances\\n      limited to the spine, the mind becoming only secondarily tired. In other\\n      cases it is spinal and cerebral; in others again chiefly cerebral. The\\n      line between this and insanity is always clearly definable. Though a\\n      neurasthenic patient may become insane, and probably the reverse, yet both\\n      are distinct conditions.\\n      \\n Books speak of this disease at common\\n      to men and women. Yet in this region in small towns as well as in large\\n      cities the cases of neurasthenia in women are preponderatingly great.\\n      \\n Hypochondriacs and hysteria stand in\\n      peculiar relation to neurasthenia. They maybe regarded as different\\n      species of the same genus; that is, more or less deeply seated\\n      disturbances of the cerebro-spinal system in which the sympathetic system\\n      is probably indirectly involved, as many functional disturbances presided\\n      over by the great sympathetic system often testify. Hypochondriasis, pure\\n      and simple as occurring in men, is easily distinguishable by its striking\\n      characteristic of introspection and despondency, occasioned by abnormal\\n      sensations, without marked physical weakness and tiredness. Pure\\n      hypochondriacs are often energetic, conscientious workers. In hysteria\\n      there is neither great tiredness nor tendency to introspection, but a\\n      paroxysmal or prolonged absence of the power of self control, in grave\\n      cases associated with tonic or clonic muscular spasm and loss of\\n      consciousness. While neurasthenia in its uncomplicated forms is free from\\n      these symptoms, but, as ample experience teaches, often complicated with\\n      both of the preceding forms to such an extent that it is often very\\n      difficult to tell which is primary and which secondary. The symptoms known\\n      as introspection, hysterical aberrations of the emotions, and neurasthenic\\n      sense of exhaustion are in their distinctive manifestations most important\\n      and constitute indications in the selection of remedial and dietetic\\n      measures.\\n      \\n The following are some observation of\\n      peculiarities observed in a large number of cases and peculiar to all:.\\n      \\n Introspection.-The neurasthenic patient\\n      in variably expresses her desire for relief, not so much in a direct\\n      appeal as in a supplicating, subdued tone of voice and manner. She rarely\\n      asks, \"What can you do to relieve me?\" but almost invariably,\\n      \"What is the cause of\" this or that sensation? If she is\\n      introspective, that is, hypochondriacal, she becomes a nosomaniac,\\n      watching acutely every one of her numerous distressing sensation, on the\\n      unremitting analysis of which her mind dwells. In marked cases she is\\n      quite unable to think of anything outside of herself, and in many cases\\n      dislikes to do so, preferring to river her attention on herself. Attempts\\n      to divert her annoy or anger her. Friends and relatives implore the\\n      physician to divert the patient, but all their attempts are in vain\\n      because quite misdirected.\\n      \\n Positive and Negative Will.-It seems\\n      sometimes as if the patient delights in her self-inspection, and that she\\n      prefers her condition to speedy recovery. This is not the case, for the\\n      patient will always assure the physician of her wish to get well. During\\n      the acute stage-a long yet definable period-this wish and longing cannot\\n      well be utilized, but the long and ill-defined period of convalescence\\n      must first be awaited. Here we shall always discover that the wish and the\\n      will of the patient are two very different mental conditions. The desire\\n      or wish for recovery is entirely unattended by any will effort to\\n      accomplish the desired end. The injunctions and directions of the\\n      physician are resisted by the same unconquerable power of negative power,\\n      or vis inertiae. The patient having been unable to exert her will, now\\n      thinks herself unable to use it.\\n      \\n Numerous Symptoms of Patients.-To\\n      physicians in search of indications for medicines each statement of\\n      patient concerning a sensation is apt to be considered as a symptom. Many\\n      years ago, when resolved to get at the keynote of a patient\\'s case, the\\n      writer determined to allow the patient to detail all her symptoms as long\\n      as she chose and to take accurate notes of each one till the right one\\n      should be disclosed; and this was to be done regardless of time and\\n      exertion. The patient, one who needed no urging to describe her\\n      \"symptoms,\" began in an almost inaudible voice, detailing one\\n      sensation after another with an unrivalled degree of clearness and\\n      vividness of expression; as she proceeded the voice became stronger, her\\n      face slightly flushed, and the most perfect descriptive language flowed in\\n      an endless stream. Each word was written down, page after page was filled;\\n      still she went on with unmistakable signs of satisfaction at being able to\\n      pour her pent-up emotions into willing and sympathetic ears. If, for a\\n      moment, the flow of language was interrupted, a simple question would\\n      re-animate her to proceed with renewed energy. Feelings seemed to beget\\n      feelings; their complexity gave the patient no trouble; her intellect was\\n      equal to the action of unraveling the most complicated sensation,\\n      separating them into their component parts and spreading them out before\\n      the mind of the listener. A glance at the watch showed that nearly two\\n      hours had passed, during which the feeblest of neurasthenic patients had\\n      talked incessantly. The note-book was full, the keynote was found. It was\\n      this: neurasthenic patients have innumerable sensation and exhibit no\\n      sings of fatigue after talking incessantly for nearly two hours.\\n      \\n Great Endurance of Neurasthenics.-The\\n      instance just related, which is one of many, illustrates two things. One\\n      is, that it is not the kind of sensation described but the fact that\\n      neurasthenics have innumerable sensations, that constitute the symptoms.\\n      The other thing is that many neurasthenics are capable of great exertion\\n      without suffering disagreeable after- effects from fatigue. This is\\n      illustrated by other cases of which I have notes. A highly neurasthenic\\n      young lady consented to camp out for her health near a lake. She was\\n      induced to join a party for a short walk along the lake. By trying what\\n      they thought a shorter road the party lost their way and took a very long\\n      walk of about four hours, through bogs and over forces. The neurasthenic\\n      was less fatigued than some of the others. The interesting observation was\\n      subsequently made that the patient had become interested in a young man of\\n      the party. She recovered her health within a year from that time. Other\\n      cases of this kind will appear under the head of therapeutic suggestions.\\n      \\n Neurasthenic Patients Crave\\n      Sympathy.-This is one of the most formidable obstacles to the curative\\n      management of such cases, for the kind of sympathy such patients crave is\\n      expressions of condolence and more or less deep affliction at so much\\n      suffering as the patient expresses. Such sympathy is most natural and does\\n      honor to the feelings of parents, sisters, brothers and husbands, but it\\n      is unfortunate that the deeper their expression of affliction so much the\\n      more profound will be the mental dejection and weakness of the patient.\\n      Almost every case which has come under the writer\\'s observation has been\\n      much hampered if not made hopeless by this condition of things, against\\n      which no remedy suggests itself that would not be construed as\\n      \"unkind\".\\n      \\n The origin of this very formidable and\\n      refractory nervous disease, like that of most diseases usually termed\\n      chronic, is either hereditary or acquired, as the histories of every\\n      observed case plainly testify. Either the father was a hypochondriac or\\n      the mother neurasthenic, or both parents were of unsound nervous\\n      constitution. Dipsomania on the part of parents produces neurasthenia in\\n      the children, as readily as it will be followed by any other form of\\n      nervous disease, according to the individual predisposition of the\\n      offspring. The excessive use of tea and coffee is another very active\\n      factor in the history of neurasthenics. Where fathers inclined to alcohol,\\n      mothers are addicted to tea and coffee, which, while its immediate effects\\n      do not obtrude themselves upon our notice, are none the less insidious in\\n      their more remote consequences.\\n      \\n The acquired forms of neurasthenia are\\n      of utmost interest to the therapeutist, and the sources of acquisition are\\n      readily stated. They are much brain-work with insufficient food and sleep.\\n      Such conditions obtain chiefly in women (less frequently in men) of fine\\n      intellectual ability, conscientiousness and ambition. Physical overwork\\n      with unintellectual women has no such effect. Quite analogous to the above\\n      are the conditions of care and sorrow, especially in women who are able\\n      for a long time to conceal and control their emotions. The usual\\n      consequence of such states of mind is disregard of food and insufficient\\n      sleep. Instances of acquired neurasthenia are presented in families of\\n      several girls and boys, where one or more of the former are Neurasthenic\\n      while the latter are vigorous and athletic. Boys delighting in vigorous\\n      exercise do not, as is the case with girls, lose appetite and sleep.\\n      \\n The effects of nervous exhaustion in\\n      boys are usually much less grave than in girls; as a rule such effects are\\n      manifested in mental, not muscular, tiredness, and they are relieved by\\n      air and exercise, while in girls and women those influences are shunned\\n      because they seem to increase the tiredness.\\n      \\n Predisposition-The temperament, or what\\n      in modern pharaseology is called the personal equation, plays a visible\\n      but uncontrollable part in the progress of neurasthenia, as temperament\\n      greatly determines the other imperfectly known condition known as\\n      predisposition. Where the disease is hereditary, it is easy to say that\\n      the predisposition is due to that source; where there is no history of\\n      heredity and where neurasthenia exists in the last members of a\\n      generation, it may be attributed to acquired predisposition which needed\\n      only the exciting cause to establish the disease in its most typical form.\\n      \\n One of the most common forms of\\n      neurasthenia, often quite intractable, results from a serious defect in\\n      our public school system, one which affects chiefly girls from twelve to\\n      fourteen years of age. The following is a brief example: The child rises\\n      late with no appetite for breakfast and no time to eat it if so inclined.\\n      The lessons, however, have been learned the evening before, and the school\\n      work is begun with an ambitions will and a crammed mind, and continues\\n      with one intermission of often not more than ten minutes or three of four\\n      hours. The pupil arrives at home ravenously hungry, eats too fast, and too\\n      much of injudiciously prepared food, too long in digesting to leave room\\n      for an appetite for even a light evening meal, or even for a breakfast the\\n      next morning.\\n      \\n In another case the girl or boy grows\\n      desperately hungry while at school, but being unprovided with food\\n      (lunch), goes on with the school exercises, at the end of which the sense\\n      of hunger has vanished and has been replaced by an aversion to normal\\n      food, with a possible craving for something pungent and indigestible. This\\n      observation can easily be made in many instances, and will, in as many\\n      cases, be seen to lead to nervous prostration, which is then treated by\\n      vile, patented concoctions consisting largely of whiskey, under the name\\n      of \"tonics,\" while the patient needs only the best that a\\n      legitimate market affords prepared in a sensible manner.\\n      \\n Typical Cases Ending in Rapid\\n      Recovery.-Curative results have already been indicated in what has been\\n      said above, and further indications for treatment may be gathered from a\\n      few cases of extremely rapid recovery of apparently incurable cases, to\\n      which brief allusion will here be made. A woman of forty had been a victim\\n      of grave neurasthenia for five years. In the absence of an inclination to\\n      exert himself, she had, during that period, been mostly confined to her\\n      bed or lounge, in the meantime giving birth to two children, going through\\n      gestation and confinement normally, without recovering from neurasthenic\\n      prostration which, in the course of some years more, rendered her entirely\\n      helpless. Her condition was associated with a feeling of dropping to\\n      pieces unless supported and braced by a harness of wood, iron and leather,\\n      in which she \"sat up\" for several hours each day, spending the\\n      rest of the time in bed. Having left the patient in this condition, it was\\n      reported before the writer\\'s next professional visit that Mrs.-had been\\n      cured, and that she was able to go out like other people. A visit to the\\n      house confirmed the report. The patient came to the door herself, and in a\\n      quiet manner, entirely without the least expression of joy or wonder at\\n      her release, stated, that having heard of a famous \"magnetic\\n      physician,\" she summoned him, was ordered by him to arise and stand;\\n      protesting that it was impossible, she was raised to her feet and again\\n      ordered to stand, then to walk. Fearing that she would fall, she begged\\n      the magnetic doctor to support her, which he peremptorily refused, saying\\n      she might fall if she liked. Instead of falling, she had to walk about the\\n      room, was then placed upon a lounge and subjected to a severe treatment of\\n      rolling and pummelling, and then ordered to dress and sit up until tired,\\n      to remain up and about like other people, and to call on the doctor in\\n      future, as he would not come so far to the patient again. This happened\\n      about twenty-five years ago, and the patient has been in very fair health\\n      arrested by insisting that all professional visits by the writer or any\\n      other physician to whose sympathy the patient could appeal must cease.\\n      This injunction was carried out conscientiously with the best results by\\n      the husband of the patient. Perhaps we may learn from this that sometimes,\\n      at least, the familiar motto is reversed, and angels rush in where fools\\n      fear to tread.\\n      \\n Profiting by this experience, another\\n      neurasthenic woman, unmarried, but of most intractable, antagonistic\\n      temperament, confined to her bed, in and out of hospitals, for years,\\n      wearing out the strength and means of her relatives and the patience of\\n      many physicians, was at length abandoned by them. It was a case of spinal\\n      and cerebral neurasthenia complicated with hypochondriasis in its most\\n      trying form of introspective maunderings and endless description of\\n      symptoms. She tormented her advisers by her endless tirades, the\\n      indulgence of which invariably aggravated her condition, and were there\\n      fore avoided, until once her physician yielded to the patient\\'s\\n      importunities for a visit, when be found her in her usual abject state of\\n      prostration. Guided by experience derived from cases like the one first\\n      described, he assisted the patient to her feet and marched her, will you\\n      nil you, up and down the room until he, at least, was thoroughly tired,\\n      and then departed with the promise never to do so again. The patient, on\\n      her part, made a number of her unnameable promises, but kept on her feet\\n      and let the doctors alone. Though not cured of deeply-rooted morbid mental\\n      faults, the neurasthenic phase of her condition had yielded to the change\\n      of the antagonistic element of her character from passive to very\\n      practical activity. A third very serious case of this kind occurred in the\\n      person of a girl of fifteen, of selfish character, who gradually became\\n      bed-ridden with spinal and cerebral neurasthenia, and tormented with the\\n      usual multifarious painful sensations, none of which, on the most\\n      pains-taking physical examination, resulted from demonstrable organic\\n      disease of genital or abdominal organs. The patient was most tenderly\\n      cared for by her mother, who, in the course of years, became so imbued\\n      with the idea of yielding to every wish and whim of the patient, that at\\n      length remonstrance became useless. The mother, though recognizing the\\n      importance of persuading or urging her daughter to depend more on herself,\\n      admitted that she had yielded so long that now she must continue to feed,\\n      dress and assist her charge in the most trivial things. Her food had to be\\n      placed in her mouth, the position of a hand or foot changed by some one\\n      else, although patient did so spontaneously when she chose. This went on\\n      for fifteen years, when the mother, growing old and feeble, died. Her\\n      maternal support being gone, the patient at once proved her ability to\\n      walk, to dress, to feed herself, and to seek light employment. Though far\\n      from well, she is equally far fro being a helpless, bed-ridden invalid.\\n      \\n A fourth case, still very vividly\\n      impressed on the writer\\'s mind, was one of a healthy, romping girl of 14,\\n      who, as happen in this remarkably capricious disease, in the midst of\\n      perfect health, one day took to her bed and remained there with all the\\n      symptoms of neurasthenia, involving first the spinal and finally the\\n      cerebral nerves. This patient was very amiable, conscientious, and\\n      sensible, never loquacious, and not troubled with hypochondriacal thoughts\\n      or sensations. Tiredness was the only expression she used in describing\\n      her feelings. There was literally no variation from this condition, which\\n      confined her to her bed for years, till she grew from a girl to a woman.\\n      Eating and sleeping well, and improving perceptibly in personal appearance\\n      and character, yet she lay on her couch tired and watched over with\\n      unremitting care by a most anxious mother, showing her solicitude and\\n      sympathy in every feature. Once, in the second year of the disease, a\\n      favorable interruption occurred. The mother, still a young woman, gave\\n      birth to another child. During her confinement the neurasthenic patient\\n      was in charge of her mother\\'s nurse, assisted by other servants. The\\n      nurse, while devoted to the daughter, agreed with the writer that excess\\n      of sympathy was injurious, and used her best and judicious endeavors\\n      gradually to persuade the patient to make some physical effort at walking\\n      and standing. In this she was so successful that in two weeks she\\n      accompanied the girl on half-mile walks up and down hill, finally without\\n      assistance. Thus, recovery seemed assured, and everything was favorable\\n      progressing towards it when the mother, having fully recovered, again took\\n      charge of her daughter, with the result that she at once took to her\\n      lounge and remained there two years longer. About that time other advice\\n      was urged and gladly acceded to, with the result that the case was\\n      diagnosed by an eminent surgeon as spinal paralysis in consequence of\\n      concussion, though it could never be shown when and where it occurred.\\n      Salves, plasters, anodynes, nervines, and electricity did no good, but\\n      effectually destroyed appetite and digestion, which higher to had been\\n      normal. So this adviser resigned in favor of a third, who, being a younger\\n      and less prejudiced man, agreed perfectly with the writer\\'s original\\n      opinion. He advised return to moderate exercise, avoidance of drugs, and\\n      less display of sympathy. This, though formerly rejected as\\n      \"unkind,\" was now acceded to as coming from a nerve- specialist,\\n      fresh from Europe, at that time very rare. Still attending the other\\n      members of the family, the writer had sample opportunity of observing the\\n      course of the case. Improvement was very slow and uncertain till financial\\n      misfortune overtook the family. Almost with a bound our patient left her\\n      cough, and, organizing a kindergarten, strove energetically in supporting\\n      herself and assisting her mother. The change came about in less than three\\n      weeks, and resulted in perfect recovery.\\n      \\n At this point another very instructive\\n      case of very speedy recovery, after six or seven years of neurasthenic\\n      prostration, deserves to be mentioned. A woman of 35 had been in bed and\\n      on the lounge most of the time for nearly seven years, at the end of which\\n      time she became my patient, her regular medical attendant having gone to\\n      Europe. She was of very amiable disposition and as sensitive as she was\\n      weak. Her symptoms, as in the other cases, were instantaneous exhaustion\\n      on the least physical exertion. She could give herself up to no mental\\n      occupation beyond directing her house-hold affairs, the education of her\\n      son, and the rehearsal of her numerous sensations. She had not been my\\n      patient long when her husband failed in business, so that the family was\\n      reduced from very comfortable circumstances to a condition which made it\\n      necessary for the patient to make her own living and that of the family.\\n      This she almost at once proceeded to do, setting aside all other\\n      considerations and establishing a boarding-house, where she did most of\\n      the work herself. This she has done now for ten or twelve years without a\\n      serious relapse. The time involved in the period of convalescence was\\n      scarcely more than three weeks, a although her work maybe said to have\\n      begun at the moment her resolution was taken.\\n      \\n Prognostics.-From these and other cases\\n      in and outside of the writer\\'s practice, it is safe to say that the\\n      majority of cases of neurasthenia recover, though years may elapse before\\n      that period. We learn, furthermore, that recoveries, especially of very\\n      inveterate cases, depend on conditions beyond the control of the\\n      physician, as was the case in the above-recorded instances, where\\n      circumstances forced the patient to cases to wish for recovery and to make\\n      an effort of the will. This having been once accomplished self-confidence,\\n      for a long time in abeyance, was permanently restored.\\n      \\n Curability, further, depends very much\\n      on the temperament of the patient, whether amiable, tractable and\\n      confiding in the honest endeavors of the physician, or whether refractory,\\n      suspicious, untruthful, selfish and antagonistic, of a disposition\\n      impossible to win over on account of unnatural distrust of every\\n      well-meaning person. The degree of intelligence of patients also has a\\n      pronounced influence on the result. The most readily curable cases are\\n      those acquired without hereditary predisposition, where the cause is found\\n      in the absence of food and sleep, also where sorrow and anxiety can be\\n      averted or counteracted by judicious conduct of near relatives and\\n      friends.\\n      \\n Dietetic Treatment.-This, as medicinal\\n      treatment, must be governed by the stage at which the case comes into the\\n      physician\\'s hands-whether yet in its prodromal, its acute or its chronic\\n      phase. The prodromal stage of the disease has no very decided\\n      pathognomonic signs. The most that can be recognized in this stage is that\\n      the patient\\'s habits or duties are of a kind which will eventually lead to\\n      obdurate neurasthenia if not arrested in time by removing the exciting\\n      causes. Too much pleasure, as well as too much care, especially in girls\\n      and woman, tends to neglect of food and rest, in the absence of which,\\n      excitements, whether of pleasure or care, begets a state of unrest in\\n      which repose is disagreeable. With such a condition comes a list of\\n      incipient casual complaints of headache, imperfect sleep, notional ways of\\n      eating, working or playing. A few questions will determine whether the\\n      patient is living according to normal or abnormal habits with regard to\\n      appetite, sleep and occupation. Where these are found, their alteration to\\n      normal ways must be instead on. It is unnecessary to say that this is\\n      easier said than done, for it will probably meet with serious objections\\n      on the part of the patient, if not on that of her relatives; for most\\n      likely she has examinations for college to prepare for, involving several\\n      months of dose and careful study at night, and the patient cannot waste\\n      time in sleeping and eating while cramming that little excited and\\n      ambitions brain. A failure in the examinations would be as much of a\\n      disappointment to parents as to patient, who proves, as usual, that this\\n      appellation is a misnomer. She accordingly goes in as she please, lied by\\n      an increasing morbidly ambitions impulse, and the result is likely to be\\n      the mournful satisfaction on the part of the physician of being obliged to\\n      say, \"I told you before what would happen.\" Of course, all\\n      regret the now evident nerve-prostration, while, if the doctor had\\n      succeeded in enforcing his rules, he would in many cases experience the\\n      still more painful reproach of having been too severe. Nevertheless,\\n      absolute firmness and a kindly but unflinching exertion of his will,\\n      without the least compromise, reward the physician with the best results\\n      in such cases.\\n      \\n When the case, after the stage of\\n      excitement and untiring restlessness (at which it would still be speedily\\n      curable by simple dietetic rules) has, after weeks or months, entered upon\\n      the phase of painful prostration, here we encounter backache, oppressive\\n      headache, and absolute loss of mental or bodily endurance, measures of\\n      dietetic management are much less effective and much more difficult to\\n      find. it is at this stage that slight rise of temperature will occur,\\n      especially towards evening; then the backache and headache disappear, the\\n      pallor is replaced by a flush of color, the eyes lose their listless look,\\n      and the patient is inclined to enter upon some diversion or excitement,\\n      followed by a restless night and a morning of exhaustion and a renewal of\\n      all painful sensations. Most of such patients feel much better in the\\n      evening when they are ready for some entertainment, while in a normal\\n      state this would be the time for relaxation and repose.\\n      \\n The dietetic treatment of this stage is\\n      methodical rest. In severe cases the patient will do well to remain in bed\\n      for several days or even for weeks. It is well to shorten this period as\\n      much as possible and to insist on walking about, or, at least. sitting for\\n      a specified time every day. This may be varied b equally specified periods\\n      of rest in the recumbent position.\\n      \\n Irregularities of eating are at this\\n      and at all times to be superseded by the most rigid regularity of meals.\\n      The traditional and conventional three-meal system, however well adapted\\n      to the needs of a vigorous man or woman, does not agree with the\\n      neurasthenic patient. It is much better that these should eat oftener;\\n      four times a day is best in most cases, for the simple reason that in this\\n      way a patient, while eating less at a time, consumes more food in the\\n      aggregate.\\n      \\n As neurasthenic patients are rarely\\n      troubled with absolute aversion to wholesome food, they are generally able\\n      to consume a liberal quantity, about which it is only needful to remark\\n      here that the food should be selected from among the articles and dishes\\n      which the patient likes, provided they belong to the order of good, normal\\n      articles of food, to the exclusion of those which simply please the taste\\n      without being digestible. A dish entirely of meat or \"animal\\n      food\" is as far from being a good diet for neurasthenics as one\\n      consisting entirely of \"vegetable\" food. As a rule, the diet\\n      list should comprise one-third of nitrogenous material and two-thirds of\\n      carbohydrates. Together with these, it is a great mistake to neglect the\\n      fats, such as good butter and the fats of meats. And, lastly, every\\n      patient of this kind should be made to drink some water often, a dietetic\\n      feature too often neglected.\\n      \\n During this stage, actually fatiguing\\n      exercise of body and mind should be avoided, while, on the other hand, the\\n      patient\\'s mind should be directed away from herself, in which she is much\\n      assisted by withholding a certain kind of emotional sympathy, quite as\\n      natural as it is difficult to repress on the part of affectionate persons.\\n      Of this, a few words further on.\\n      \\n There is no definite time for the\\n      duration of this stage, which, however, depends largely on the time during\\n      which the exciting causes have acted, either aided by or without a\\n      predisposition. It is certain, however, that the sooner it is recognized\\n      and the exciting causes eliminated, so much the sooner recovery will\\n      begin. But there is a stage at which the best of experience and judgment\\n      often fail, especially in very inveterate cases. If the case is one of a\\n      patient whom the physician has had opportunity of watching at least since\\n      the earlier stages, the difficulty is not so great as it is in old cases\\n      months or even of several years\\' duration which come to treatment late. In\\n      these, the line between the intermediate stage and incipient convalescence\\n      cannot be drawn. The patient is as neurasthenic and hypochondriacal as\\n      ever; cannot bear the slightest mental or bodily exertion, not even a word\\n      or a look, without sings of apparent exhaustion, while nearly the whole\\n      time is spent in bed under anxious care of sympathetic attendants. In such\\n      cases, having become assured, by careful physical examination, of the\\n      absence of organic disease, seeing the patient generally well nourished\\n      and in fair muscular condition, the physician is warranted in assuming\\n      that the disease has run its course, that whatever morbid (pathological)\\n      process there may have been progressing in the nervous system, this\\n      process has now come to and end, but it has left the patient\\'s mental\\n      condition habituated to the moods of the past months or years, and fixed,\\n      as it were, indelibly in the memory. It is the habit that now remains, not\\n      the disease.\\n      \\n If reasonably sure of this, and calling\\n      to mind the rapid recoveries and the circumstances attending them, as\\n      above detailed, the physician is now safe in ordering a more energetic\\n      treatment, calculated to rouse the self-reliance of the patient. All\\n      visible signs of sympathy must now be set aside; the actins and demeanor\\n      of the attendants should, from this time, if not before, be changed so as\\n      to give the patient the impression that she is no longer an invalid, but\\n      expected to rely on her own exertion. Instead of being fed, the food\\n      should be placed where she must go for and eat it. She should now be\\n      expected to dress and attend, without assistance, to her natural wants.\\n      This, with some temperaments, is almost impossible, with al extremely\\n      difficult. The best course to pursue is to remove such patients from\\n      sympathetic relatives or friends, and to place them in charge of kind,\\n      reliable, but eminently practical nurses.\\n      \\n The first effect of this is either to\\n      throw the patient into a stage of helpless despondency, which, again\\n      appealing powerfully to the sympathies of those nearest to her, often\\n      frustrates the physician\\'s plans which, if firmly but kindly adhered to,\\n      would, ere long, prove of their superiority by signs of returning\\n      self-reliance and absence of complaints on the part of the patient. A\\n      second form of effect is that occurring in patients of obstreperous,\\n      selfish disposition, whose opposition and even anger is aroused by being\\n      thrown on their own resources after the removal of depressing and\\n      unpractical sympathy. This opposition or temper, often manifested in all\\n      sorts of intrigues and subterfuges on the part of the patient, if not\\n      supinely yielded to by sympathetic persons, will finally be replaced by a\\n      more rational disposition. On the whole, anger or active opposition are\\n      signs of returning energy, which, once coming to the consciousness of the\\n      patient, takes the form of self- reliance. it is this way that the cures\\n      of chronic cases above related can be explained, and physicians should\\n      profit by such experience for the benefit of their patients.\\n      \\n The general dietetic management now\\n      readily follows from what has been said, and needs only a few general\\n      modifications. The first duty of the physician will be to test the degree\\n      of reliance to be placed on the patient and her friends, ad to win them\\n      over if possible to his plans, and his success will be in proportion to\\n      the degree of confidence he is able to inspire. This personal confidence\\n      should not degenerate into a mere personal liking or attachment of a\\n      sympathy-craving neurasthenic who should discover henceforth that all\\n      sentimental expressing of sympathy are about to take a practical form,\\n      aiming at a definite result-the patient\\'s health-which she wishes but\\n      cannot exert her will to attain. The best and often the only way to do\\n      away with sentiment and to reach practical kindness is to remove the\\n      patient from certain home influence, and to place her in a hospital or\\n      elsewhere under the management of competent nurses who, without being\\n      selfish, know how to exert a certain amount of wholesome push as fast as\\n      the patient can bear it. Without the removal of sentimental sympathy, all\\n      efforts at counteracting the purely hypochondriacal side of neurasthenia\\n      are useless.\\n      \\n In these cases of neurasthenia as yet\\n      uncomplicated with the hypochondriacal element of introspective nosomania,\\n      there is only one unconditional rule to be followed, especially in\\n      acquired cases whose evident cause was incessant, conscientious work of\\n      mind and body, together with insufficient food and sleep. Such cases come\\n      on very insidiously, the loss of strength-that is, the actual waste of\\n      nerve-substance-being just a trifle grater than the quantity restored, the\\n      patient unconsciously using up a minute part of her capital every day.\\n      Here the rule should be to reverse matters to insuring a supply of\\n      nourishment and time for its assimilation greater than was the case\\n      heretofore. The case of young school-girls belong in this class. The time\\n      of food and rest should be carefully controlled at home, the duty of the\\n      physician being to educate indifferent and ignorant parents up to an\\n      appreciation of the nature of the case. It is generally not difficult to\\n      open their eyes through the medium of their anxiety concerning their\\n      children\\'s health. Having thus insured sufficient rest and food at home,\\n      the physician\\'s next object of attention should be the regulations of the\\n      school. Here is the point where teachers have an opportunity of exerting\\n      their most practical influence. It should be made obligatory on the part\\n      of teachers to institute inquiry as to whether pupils have had their meals\\n      before coming to school. This they could often ascertain without a\\n      question, by reading the pupil\\'s condition in her emaciated form, pale\\n      face and nervous manner. To guard against neglect at home, it would be an\\n      easy matter to insist that all pupils of public and private schools should\\n      bring with them some proper food. The few who do so generally bring\\n      sweets-an apple, orange or a few dry crackers-when a piece of good bread\\n      and slice of cold meat would be what they actually need. All pupils should\\n      pass inspection, and if remiss in this important particular, the\\n      delinquent should be dismissed with several marks against her. To expect\\n      this of teachers would be a great advance in the place of futile\\n      innovations of endeavoring to send forth from our common schools graduates\\n      in arts and sciences.\\n      \\n Sudden Effects.-A large number of cases\\n      of neurasthenia, especially those complicated with inveterate\\n      Hypochondriasis, are frequently traced to some sudden occurrence, having\\n      the effect of a mental or physical shock. In one patient, a vigorous girl,\\n      used to romping, climbing and running lie a boy, the cause was supposed to\\n      be a slight thump she received during a game of blindman\\'s-buff. She\\n      thought nothing of it at the time, but it was suggested long after the\\n      patient\\'s illness began. In another case some mental shock of joy or\\n      grief, not very severe and such as is often experienced in every person\\'s\\n      life, is the beginning of months of nervous prostration.\\n      \\n There is quite an array of evidence\\n      that neurasthenia which has entered upon a hypochondriacal stage or\\n      complication with or without a strong hysterical admixture, is curable by\\n      sudden impressions in the form of a shock, or more gradually by frequent\\n      repetitions of an impression. Such cases, as I have shown above, occur\\n      most commonly in the stage when what may be considered the essential\\n      pathological disturbances of function have run their course and have left\\n      the patient in a state of mental disturbance which indicated that the\\n      patient\\'s recovery depends entirely upon her volition. But there is none,\\n      and so far nothing has succeeded in arousing it. Persuasion is as useless\\n      and irritating, as argument would be in a case of insanity with a fixed\\n      illusion. The resemblance between this and the state of mind of a\\n      hypochondriacal neurasthenic is very close. She cannot move nor thick.\\n      Exhaustion overcomes her and keeps her its victim for years, when suddenly\\n      the scene changes, and a few days or weeks suffice to restore the patient\\n      to activity. In one instance it is attributed to medical, in another to\\n      \"mind cure,\" in a third to \"Christian science;\" in\\n      still other cases massage has done it, in others again \"magnetic\\n      influence,\" in others the very powerful factor necessity. It is\\n      certain that cases of this kind, produced by sudden effects on the mind of\\n      a predisposed person, are also cured by such effects. Whatever the visible\\n      form of these effects may be -whether that of \"Christian\\n      science,\" joy, grief or absolute inexorable necessity, there is\\n      always to be noticed a certain force and condition involving the modern\\n      idea of suggestion, which comes to the patient in an irresistible degree\\n      and now sets the function of the will in motion again.\\n      \\n Experience teaches that it is by no\\n      means a matter of indifference which of these forms of effect are brought\\n      into action. In one case it is the professional Christian scientist\\'s\\n      method, in another the almost brutal exertion of a person\\'s will combined\\n      with some physical force. In either case the patient is aroused from his\\n      inertia, and discovers his powers of mental and bodily ability to act.\\n      \\n A deplorable result is that recoveries\\n      after such effects are attributed in the popular mind to supernatural\\n      causes. That such is not the case may be gathered form instances occurring\\n      in very sensible and intelligent patients, whose reason is scarcely ever\\n      so far disturbed and weakened that they do not resent the proposition of\\n      trying, e.g., Christian science or mind cure.\\n      \\n Nevertheless, it is the mind cure which\\n      the intelligent patient needs quite as much as the ignorant and\\n      superstitious person; the difference is only the form in which the\\n      influencing force is applied. While in one case it is obedience to the\\n      candidly expressed instructions of the physician, in the other case the\\n      result is the to mystification. In either case it is the powerful stimulus\\n      of hope and aroused confidence that recovery will be realized.\\n      \\n The definition of suggestion does not\\n      fully cover the meaning, because the influence employed is greater than\\n      mere suggestion. The physician\\'s plan of action should be straightforward\\n      assurance of recovery, a direct appeal to hope, and an unceasing endeavor\\n      to arouse the self-reliance of the patient, not so much by verbal\\n      exhortations as by a manner and department from which the patient learns\\n      more readily than from words what is expected. If the attitude of the\\n      physician is appreciated, and seconded by the relatives and attendants, a\\n      favorable result is much more certain to follow.\\n      \\n Hypnotism is not advisable. There are\\n      now existing ancient neurasthenic invalids dating from the times of\\n      spiritualism when they were famous \"mediums.\" Hypnotism weakness\\n      the will and nervous endurance, and produces a predisposition to emotional\\n      nervousness with an intractable erotic admixture. The suggestions sought\\n      to be instilled into a hypnotized patient amount to nothing. The mental\\n      influence of mystical treatment administered while the patients is awake\\n      is much more powerful in awaking hope and confidence than the uncertain\\n      effects of an abnormal state like that of hypnotism. Mystification, again,\\n      though sometimes unavoidable with the best intention, is less powerful\\n      than direct and intelligible encouragement. While resort to mystification\\n      should be shunned by reputable physicians, the question arises as to what\\n      shall be done with the many who, from lack of intelligence or education,\\n      are entirely beyond the reach of honest common sense, and who will persist\\n      in mystifying themselves, who remain neurasthenic invalids in spite of the\\n      best regulations of the physician, and who do not recover unless their\\n      encouragement follows some mystical formalities which alone arouse their\\n      \"faith\" and finally their confidence and will-power. For the\\n      present there is no way out of the dilemma but to submit such patients to\\n      the suggestive methods of what is popularly known as mind cure and\\n      Christian science. In doing so, physicians should use their influence as\\n      far as possible in selecting the most honest persons of this class.\\n      \\n DISCUSSION.\\n      \\n JAMES C. WOOD, M.D.: I have nothing but\\n      words of praise for Dr. Wesselhoeft\\'s excellent paper. It is very evident\\n      that the author\\'s inspiration came not from books but from actual contact\\n      with neurasthenic subjects, for the impress of originality is most\\n      conspicuous. It is a production which could only come from one of\\n      experience and from a reasoner. I consider it a most valuable contribution\\n      to the literature of that now most interesting subject,\\n      \"neurasthenia\".\\n      \\n The doctor, in his paper, has sometimes\\n      used the term \"neurasthenia\" instead of\\n      \"neurasthenia.\" The first of these means, according to Thomas,\\n      great nervous power or excitement; the second, nervous debility. I taken\\n      it from the context that the subject dealt with is neurasthenia. To the\\n      average mind there exists what seems to me a needless confusion regarding\\n      the terms, nervous prostration, hysteria and hystero-neurosis. As I\\n      understand these terms they define distinct conditions, though there is a\\n      frequent blending the one with the other. The term nervous prostration,\\n      which is a synonym of neurasthenia, defines itself; the term hysteria\\n      should be restricted to those general neuroses characterized particularly\\n      by psychical manifestations, though not infrequently by motor, sensory,\\n      secretory, vasomotor and reflex derangements as well; while the term\\n      hysteroneurosis implies the uterine origin of symptoms manifesting\\n      themselves in organs remote from the uterus without structural changes in\\n      such organs, being the direct result of reflex nervous influence starting\\n      from the uterus. The last term does not occur in the paper under\\n      discussion. From the standpoint of a gynecologist I think that this is\\n      misleading.\\n      \\n Let us see why and how it is that these\\n      three conditions (I will not call them diseases) are so frequently\\n      associated. I think that all will admit the frequent occurrence in woman\\n      of reflex symptoms, the result of pelvic lesions. An irritation staring\\n      form the pelvis is conveyed to the genito-spinal centre, thence to any or\\n      all organs with which this centre communicates. The organ oftener involved\\n      than any other is the stomach. This is shown by the frequent occurrence of\\n      nausea and vomiting following conception. The nervous system may have been\\n      previously involved, but oftener it becomes so only after the nutrition is\\n      depraved, which, sooner or later, occurs if the pelvic lesion is not\\n      removed. The depraved blood fails to supply the nerve centres with that\\n      which they need to sustain them, and they become anaemic. Prostration is\\n      but a subjective manifestation of the anaemia, and it varies in degree\\n      from a slight indisposition to the most abject helplessness.\\n      \\n If, then, nervous prostration may have\\n      its beginning in a pelvic lesion, is it possible for a pelvic lesion to be\\n      inaugurated by systemic disturbances? Personally, I believe that it is,\\n      and offer this explanation as the modus operandi by which such a lesion is\\n      induced: Marked circulatory changes nearly always attend nervous\\n      prostration. The circulation is presided over by the vaso-motor system,\\n      and wear and repair depend upon the proper regulation of this system. If\\n      it becomes disturbed, the bloodvessels dilate or contract unduly, with\\n      resulting local hyperaemia or local anaemia, as the case maybe. The\\n      climacteric flushes are the result of such disturbance. The alternate\\n      coldness and heat of the extremities, so often associated with rectal and\\n      uterine lesions, is another familiar illustration. If the brain is\\n      involved, either insomnia or drowsiness occur, depending upon whether the\\n      brain is anaemic or hyperaemic. Flatulence, gastralgia, and nervous\\n      dyspepsia result when the stomach is similarly affected. The womb and the\\n      ovaries, because of the periodical congestion imposed upon them, are\\n      oftener implicated by these unnatural circulatory disturbances than any of\\n      the pelvic organs, and in time also become unduly hyperaemic or anaemic,\\n      as the case may be.\\n      \\n It will thus be seen that nervous\\n      prostration may exist independently of pelvic lesions, or, conversely,\\n      pelvic lesions may exist independently of nervous prostration.\\n      Nevertheless, the two are frequently associated, and this fact ought, I\\n      believe, to be kept in mind in dealing with the affection known as\\n      neurasthenia. Hysterical manifestations nearly always come to the surface\\n      in nervous prostration, and they also frequently attend pelvic lesions.\\n      Indeed, the term \"hystero-psychosis\" has been coined for the\\n      purpose of defining certain psychical disturbances of presumably pelvic\\n      origin, and in the broadest sense neurasthenia is not uncommonly an\\n      hysteroneurosis. It is the frequent association of these three conditions\\n      which, it seems to me, makes it more practicable to study them conjointly.\\n      \\n The special symptoms of nervous\\n      prostration are most variable. Introspection, as Dr. Wesselhoeft has\\n      pointed out, makes of the patient a nosomaniac. The anaemic nerve centres\\n      are unduly impressionable, and a mental shock which would not seriously\\n      affect a stronger and more rugged woman falls with crushing force upon one\\n      whose nutrition is already depraved. In this way are developed disorders\\n      of sensibility, alternations of mobility, circulatory disturbances,\\n      anomalies of secretion and exertion, disorders of the gastro-intestinal\\n      canal, dermatoses, and general and psychical disturbances of all kinds.\\n      Many of these affections start from pelvic lesions, and are nearly always\\n      associated with depravity of nutrition and more or less nervous\\n      prostration.\\n      \\n Some of the worst symptoms of\\n      neurasthenia with which I have had to contend have been hyperaesthesia of\\n      the articulations, giving rise to the so-called \"hysterical\\n      joint.\" Here the prostration is usually not profound, and it is\\n      possible to apply the somewhat energetic treatment recommended by Dr.\\n      Wesselhoeft. I remember one case very distinctly, the detailed history of\\n      which I shall give in another place, which brought me much reputation\\n      because of the \"remarkable\" cure I was fortunate enough to make.\\n      \\n The patient, a beautiful girl of\\n      eighteen, had been bed- ridden for three years with supposed hip-joint\\n      disease. She was in college before assuming the ride of an invalid, and\\n      worried much over her studies and work. She sustained a fall a short time\\n      previously to taking to her bed, and to this fall the injury to the hip\\n      was attributed. She had been from physician to physician and from\\n      sanitarium to sanitarium without receiving benefit. All of the numerous\\n      medical men under whose care she had been, directed their attention to the\\n      hip and applied the classical treatment for morbus coxarius without avail.\\n      The patient had finally reached a point where introspection was her chief\\n      occupation and her mind dwelt almost continually upon a \"diseased\\n      hip.\" She was finally brought to me, coming in an invalid\\'s chair and\\n      looking the very picture of dependency. There was a slight degree of\\n      anaemia, though this was not marked. Notwithstanding the expression\\n      expression of abjectness the girl did not look seriously ill. The hip was\\n      excessively tender upon pressure, but there was no local increase of\\n      temperature, no evidences of fever and suppuration, and forcible\\n      apposition by striking the heel was not very painful. More less spastic\\n      contraction of the flexor muscles of the affected side existed, which gave\\n      to the limb an appearance of actual shortening, which was very deceptive.\\n      Hysterical symptoms were common. On examination I found the left ovary\\n      exquisitely tender. Compression of the ovary increased the pain in the hip\\n      most decidedly and gave rise to much nervous agitation. I did not,\\n      therefore, deem it wise to recommend local treatment other than the daily\\n      use of the hot douche. She had long been a victim of ovarian\\n      dysmenorrhoea. I placed upon the ankle of the affected limb three pounds\\n      of bar-lead, prescribed a pair of crutches and insisted upon her walking.\\n      The lead was used to overcome the spastic contraction as well as for its\\n      moral effect. I did not deem the joint lesion of such a character as to\\n      used extension. In two months\\' time this patient discarded her crutches\\n      for a cane. Six weeks later she put up the cane and is now perfectly well.\\n      \\n This was a case in which somewhat harsh\\n      measures were eminently appropriate.\\n      \\n In marked contrast to the case just\\n      recorded is the following: Mrs.-, aet. 47, widow for twenty years. She is\\n      a devoted church-woman, and for years was a leader in all charitable work\\n      done in the community in which she resided. Through friends she was urged\\n      to consult me, and I think that the call to the neighboring town in which\\n      she lived was countermanded at least four or five times before the finally\\n      mustered up courage and strength enough to see me. Upon reaching the\\n      bedside I found my patient in a room made dark by closed blinds, over\\n      which were hung heavy blankets to shut out every ray of light. The mirror\\n      was turned toward the wall for fear a ray of light might strike it and\\n      flesh throughout the darkened room. Nor did the patient rest under these\\n      extreme precautions, for the eyes were protected with two pairs of colored\\n      glasses with side attachments. Hyperaesthesia of the sense of hearing was\\n      equally marked and the noise was excluded from the room by double doors\\n      whose keyholes were stuffed with cotton. She l so had her ears filled with\\n      cotton, over which she wore ear-mufflers. She was emaciated to an extreme\\n      degree, and had been reduced to her miserable condition by a series of\\n      events which frequently precede profound neurasthenia. Her husband was\\n      killed during the war, and she was left childless. Twelve months previous\\n      to taking to her bed she nursed her mother through a long and fatal\\n      illness. This greatly prostrated her, yet she kept up until a favorite\\n      brother-in-law was thrown from a carriage and killed. This was the last\\n      straw, and the shock compelled her to take to her bed. In due time loss of\\n      appetite with irritability of the stomach developed, which, of course, led\\n      to marked depravity of nutrition. With the anaemia came hyperaesthesia of\\n      the special senses, spinal irritation, headache, hysterical\\n      manifestations, etc. There was no series pelvic lesion, although she had\\n      been much treated for an alleged uterine displacement with congestion.\\n      Unfortunately, she was encouraged, instead of discouraged, in her\\n      invalidism, and she soon became a nosomaniac of the worst type. She had\\n      written down her symptoms one at a time, and the record is such a typical\\n      one that I should like to give it in full, but time forbids.\\n      \\n With great difficulty the patient was\\n      moved on a cough to a private hospital and placed under the Weir Mitchell\\n      treatment. I ignored the pelvic trouble entirely. It is unnecessary to\\n      give in detail the progress of the case from day to day after this\\n      treatment was inaugurated. Suffice it to say that the improvement was of\\n      the most marked character, and in six weeks from the time she entered the\\n      hospital she walked to her carriage with her eyes and ears unprotected.\\n      She soon resumed her church and charitable work, in which she again takes\\n      much delight.\\n      \\n This woman wanted to get well. She was\\n      a woman of pure motives and high ideals. She had, in the language of Dr.\\n      Wesselhoeft, the wish, but, unaided, not the will. She required the aid of\\n      an intelligent, strong-minded, nurse who could bring to her exercise\\n      applied in such a way as to enable her to assimilate food without the\\n      expenditure of nerve force. She co- operated with her physician and nurse\\n      in every possible way, and as soon as the anaemic nerve cells became\\n      flushed with new blood she began to improve. To have commanded this\\n      patient \"to take up her bed and walk\" before improving her\\n      nutrition would have been as unscientific as to have placed the first\\n      patient in bed with extension and counter-extension applied to the limb. I\\n      know of no class of cases requiring for their successful treatment more\\n      tact and discrimination than that under consideration.\\n      \\n I feel confident that I have many times\\n      cut the affection short in its prodromal stage by removing the girl from\\n      college work and insisting upon open-air exercise. Static electricity has,\\n      in my hands, proved exceedingly useful both during the prodromal stage and\\n      that of convalescence.\\n      \\n I will conclude by saying that I have\\n      been impressed with the frequency with which an hereditary history of\\n      epilepsy has been met with in the cases of neurasthenia passing under my\\n      observation.'\n",
      " 'Tresorie - SOME OF THE DISEASES PREVENTING AND COMPLICATION PREGNANCY\\n[Diseases Preventing & Complicating Pregnancy]\\n\\n STERILITY.-DeSinety, Treub, Furbinger,\\n      et al., attribute 50 per cent. of unproductive marriages to the husbands,\\n      saying that sterility in the male is more often the cause of barren\\n      marriages than is generally supposed.\\n      \\n This cause of sterility I pass by, as\\n      also sterility due to mechanical obstruction, incomplete ovulation and the\\n      numerous other causes of this condition, too manifold for mere\\n      enumeration, to consider obesity as a causative agent in this condition. I\\n      need not say that the advocates for surgical interference for the relief\\n      of this condition are legion. Sims makes the assertion that sterility can\\n      be cured by surgical means only. That, of course, is Allopathic arguing\\n      pure and simple. Cases requiring surgical interference do arise, but any\\n      treatment which raises the nutrition of the entire organism, improves the\\n      blood-formation, and favors the resorption of pathological products in the\\n      sexual organs, is to be regarded as the indicated remedy.\\n      \\n Published statements are my authority\\n      for saying that excellent results have followed the administration of\\n      drugs, nevertheless; and in complete defiance of all therapeutic measures,\\n      a certain percentage of women remain barren; for with the more occult\\n      causes of sterility we remain, as yet, unacquainted, consequently they\\n      cannot all be reached with say kind of treatment whatever.\\n      \\n The following case I report somewhat in\\n      detail. Whilst not an exceptional case at all, it bears directly upon the\\n      subject under consideration, and possesses, it seems to me, some decidedly\\n      interesting features. My object in selecting this particular one is to\\n      call attention, if possible, to a condition not sufficiently considered.\\n      Mrs. J., aet. 26, married about two years and a half, appealed to my\\n      knowledge for a reason as to why she remained childless. The lady was\\n      carrying an excess of flesh, being under the medium height, and weighing\\n      186 pounds, but appeared to be in good health; family and previous history\\n      all that could be desired. Examination showed none of the common causes of\\n      sterility; neither, so far as I could ascertain, was the husband\\n      responsible for this unproductive condition of affairs. Some previous\\n      experiences of my own, with the added testimony of other and able men, was\\n      my reason for charging this condition of things to the excess of flesh,\\n      this, by the husband, being laughingly charged to excess of laziness.\\n      \\n We all, undoubtedly, are familiar with\\n      that peculiar disease of the blood-corpuscles which, whilst producing\\n      flesh, relaxes at the same time the muscular force; acting also, I\\n      believe, upon the muscular fibres of the uterus and upon the ovaries,\\n      inducing not only serious menstrual disorders but sterility. McKee,\\n      Philbert, and others give several instances of sterility chargeable to\\n      obesity, the women in question having been married several years without\\n      bearing children, and all became mothers after losing a portion of their\\n      flesh. If any other argument were needed in support of this theory we\\n      might turn to the quadrupeds, where we find the poorest breeders among the\\n      fleshiest animals. Fournel has a very able treatise on \"The Effects\\n      of Obesity on the Menstrual Functions and Parturition.\" Without\\n      having had any actual case of this description to deal with, he inclines\\n      very strongly towards the belief that obesity favors sterility. In the\\n      treatment of the case before mentioned, the patient was subjected to a\\n      daily massage of the entire body, with a special pelvic massage three\\n      times a week. This, in the main, consists in elevating the uterus as high\\n      as possible with the finger in the vagina, ending with a quick and decided\\n      vibratory motion. The diet received particular attention, as at this time\\n      there was a slight gastric ailment. The indicated remedy, Thuja, was given\\n      in the minimum dose. At the end of three months almost thirty pounds of\\n      flesh was gone, a considerable reduction. As an experiment, I recommended\\n      coitus in the knee-elbow position, advising that the lady remain quiet as\\n      long as possible after coition, with thighs well flexed. She became\\n      enciente, but miscarried at eight weeks. There was, comparatively\\n      speaking, but little pain and not much subsequent haemorrhage. She made a\\n      rapid recovery. Since then a living child has been born to them.\\n      \\n I believe I am safe in saying that this\\n      result would hardly have obtained were it not for the prophylactic\\n      measures adopted.\\n      \\n At the end of the first two months the\\n      patient was attacked with haemorrhage. A similar occurrence took place at\\n      irregular intervals during the following five months, the quantity of\\n      blood lost being much greater than that at the normal menstrual period.\\n      \\n For the greater part of the last five\\n      months she kept her bed, at the end of which time the tendency of the\\n      uterus to empty itself could be resisted no longer. A seven months\\' child\\n      was born, and is to-day doing well.\\n      \\n Pseudocyesis cerebral pregnancy,\\n      phantom pregnancy (whatever name we may call it by) is a disease which\\n      must come under the head of those \"complicating pregnancy.\" Mrs.\\n      M., a lady, married two or three years, aet. 29. Previous history good,\\n      always enjoying perfect health. When I first saw the lady in question she\\n      was a perfect picture of health, and, according to appearance and her own\\n      statements, about seven months pregnant. I made no examination. This\\n      appeared to be a thoroughly intelligent woman, and, according to her own\\n      statement, there was cessation of the menses. There certainly was an\\n      enlargement of the abdomen and breasts, a milky secretion, and the lady\\n      was sure that she felt foetal movement. On February 28th of the present\\n      year I was called to attend her in labor. Examination showed that no\\n      pregnancy existed. So far as I could ascertain there was no assignable\\n      origin for this condition other than nervous influences, the phenomena\\n      being purely muscular distension of the abdomen.\\n      \\n Mayham reports a case of a woman 73\\n      years old, claiming to be pregnant; he also claims that subsequently she\\n      was delivered of a child; this is an Allopathic report, however, of which\\n      we will take a Homoeopathic dose. Haultain reports three cases of cerebral\\n      pregnancy. In the first, he says no cause whatever was to be found; in the\\n      second, there was a small fibroid growth in the anterior uterine wall.\\n      Hauck reports a case where the vomiting, peristalsis, and flatus, caused\\n      by alcoholism were supposed to be caused by the pregnant state. Such cases\\n      are uncommon, but they emphasize the importance of making a thorough\\n      examination, in all cases where positive information is desired of the\\n      existence or non-existence of pregnancy.\\n      \\n Hyperemesis Gravidarum.-An animated\\n      discussion, held recently between two celebrated Allopaths of Stuttgart\\n      and Leipsic, has served to awaken a renewed interest in this subject,\\n      without in the least adding anything new to our stock of knowledge\\n      regarding its aetiology. Notwithstanding the frequency of the vomiting of\\n      pregnancy, its very distressing character in many instances, and its\\n      imminent, its very distressing character in many instances, and its\\n      imminent danger, we find but very few contributions of any value, to\\n      either the aetiology of the disorder or its therapeutics. I do not expect\\n      to add anything specially new myself, but it does seem to me that our\\n      knowledge of the vomiting of pregnancy, is to say the least, in a most\\n      contradictory state. Some physicians look upon it as a trifling matter,\\n      others as a thing to be endured, and some-these are in the right too-view\\n      even the mildest cases with gravity. Even in the mildest cases of morning\\n      sickness there is a constant drain upon the nervous system, putting the\\n      sufferer into a condition, in which she is very much less able to endure\\n      parturition than she would otherwise have been.\\n      \\n Dr. Harrison Mettler says: \"After\\n      careful inquiry I find that women who suffer from much morning sickness\\n      have as a rule, tedious or otherwise troublesome labors. I have observed\\n      in multiparae that at one time they will have much nausea and vomiting\\n      followed by a difficult labor, while at another time they will be quite\\n      free from the vomiting, and will pass through the succeeding labor with\\n      comparative ease.\" I must say my observations make me agree with Dr.\\n      Mettler entirely; when one thinks how rapidly the mildest of cases assume\\n      pernicious forms, indifference is certainly no longer to be excused. There\\n      is a voluminous literature upon this subject, and many and varied are the\\n      aetiological reasons given for this very variable affection, a large\\n      majority of writers coinciding in the opinion that \"many causes\\n      operate together,\" to produce what we are pleased to designate the\\n      \"vomiting of pregnancy.\" I believe myself that in a large\\n      percentage of cases, this pernicious vomiting is simply the result of a\\n      reflex neurosis. Undoubtedly uterine displacements frequently cause\\n      vomiting; but when this is so, and the displaced organ is raised by\\n      packing the vagina with aseptic wool, the vomiting ceases.\\n      \\n Lillie reports a number of cases, where\\n      obstinate vomiting was caused by a retroflexed uterus, and restoration of\\n      the organ caused a cessation of the disorder. Bezugloff having a\\n      persistent case of morning sickness, introduced a bougie it no the uterus,\\n      the intention being to produce abortion; the immediate result was a\\n      stoppage of the vomiting, and the pregnancy went on to full term.\\n      \\n In the case just cited, I must say that\\n      I believe it was the fright, caused by the thought of abortion being\\n      performed, more than the effects of introducing the bougie, which operated\\n      so successfully; I say now, as I said before, I believe that the\\n      pre-eminent cause of this kind of sickness must be looked for i the\\n      nervous system. Flint speaks of this form of sickness as being decidedly\\n      neurotic in its origin, and cites a number of cases of a chronic variety\\n      of dyspepsia frequently occurring in young girls. I had one such case come\\n      under my personal care. There was a persistent morning sickness, with this\\n      young lady, and a disagreeable nausea whenever food was taken; this\\n      patient was at some distance from her home, in a boarding school, and she\\n      will probably never know that the lady principal entertained very grave\\n      thoughts at one time in regard to her virtue. It certainly was very\\n      difficult to differentiate between this and the vomiting of pregnancy; it\\n      was, however, simply due to a vitiated nervous system. My theory is\\n      supported by Alt, who records a number of such cases; I cite one only, the\\n      case being that of a highly hysterical woman, six months pregnant,\\n      suffering from the gravest vomiting, and anxious that miscarriage be\\n      induced. She was making preparation for entering the hospital for this\\n      purpose, when one of her children was seized with pneumonia. The anxiety\\n      felt over the child, forced all thought of self from the mother\\'s mind;\\n      from that moment the vomiting ceased and she remained well until the\\n      termination of pregnancy.-Minchener Medicinische Wochenschrift.\\n      \\n Whilst saying that I believe this\\n      disease to be in the majority of cases of purely nervous origin, I would\\n      not imply thereby that it is not to be feared, far from it; if neglected,\\n      we know how likely it is to pass quickly beyond treatment and our patient\\n      succumb from sheer exhaustion.\\n      \\n In the treatment cited such as\\n      insertion of bougies, dilation of the os, pelvic massage, etc., I believe\\n      it is merely the \"doing something,\" no matter much what it is,\\n      so long as you have gained the confidence of your patient, that does good.\\n      We have seen how suddenly Hyperemesis will cease if the patient be\\n      alarmed; it may be, has often been, and will to again, cured by a process\\n      skin to suggestion. Kattenback had a case where the patient, a primipara,\\n      was seized with an incorrigible vomiting. It was suggested to her that her\\n      stomach contained some lumps of unwholesome material and their removal\\n      would cure her. Some milk was given her, and the stomach ceremoniously\\n      washed out. its contents bore no indications of either over-acidity or\\n      abnormal ferment She was informed that she was all right and the vomiting\\n      would not return; neither did if, and she was safely delivered at term.\\n      \\n There is a familiar and now well-know\\n      phenomena, by which these neurotics can be influenced; I speak of\\n      hypnotism; it is due to purely subjective conditions.\\n      \\n There is an identity of the hypnotic\\n      susceptibility with the condition of hysteria, and it is along these lines\\n      that we can work. Just as many times as I have tried this method of\\n      treatment, for these cases of excessive vomiting, just so many times has\\n      it given me gratifying results.\\n      \\n The patient can be to sleep by\\n      bi-ocular pressure, and the idea of cure suggested; the operation may have\\n      to be repeated several times, at intervals of a day or so, but you will be\\n      rewarded by the cessation of the vomiting, often with but one suggestion.\\n      Where the patient is not easily controlled by means of the bi-ocular\\n      pressure, Luy\\'s revolving mirror is a never failing resource.'\n",

It must recognize too, that\\n      the sick individual has to take an active part in his treatment and not be\\n      merely the passive recipient of this or that treatment. For just as it is\\n      rightly said that man does not live by alone, so should it be emphasized\\n      that man cannot be cured by medicine alone. He must see to it himself that\\n      he lives as far as possible a physically and psychically healthy life.\\n      Indeed, each individual has a power within himself to help in his own\\n      cure.\\n      \\n Do the official schools of medicine\\n      teach such an art today? I am afraid not: they are so intent on seeking\\n      the specific treatment for this or that named disease or the antibiotic\\n      that will most effectively put out of action the organism regarded as the\\n      cause of the disease, that they are losing sight of the individual\\n      himself.\\n      \\n But Homoeopathy in its persistent\\n      search for the reactions of the individual to his environment in the\\n      broadest sense, no matter of what the patient is complaining surely\\n      fulfills these requirements, especially when it is recognized that the\\n      homoeopathic potencies do not anything to the patient as do the drugs of\\n      the dominant school, but rather stimulate the patients own recuperative\\n      powers to overcome the infection or re - establish the normal metabolism\\n      which has become deranged by the illness.\\n      \\n When you consider how the homoeopathic\\n      physician diagnoses the individuality of his patient over and above the\\n      name of the disease from which he is suffering, and uses for the purpose\\n      of his prescription rather than the name of the disease this personal\\n      diagnosis of the patients mental and emotional reactions, his responses to\\n      changes in weather conditions, the alternations in his environment which\\n      influence his symptoms, etc., one realize how very individualistic is the\\n      Homoeopathic prescription fitted to that particular patient.\\n      \\n The homoeopathic physician does not\\n      seek for a remedy specific to any named disease and which he can thus\\n      apply almost automatically once he has made his organic diagnosis, which\\n      in quite an appreciable number of instances may ultimately be found to be\\n      wrong and so the treatment based upon it must therefore have been wrong.\\n      He does not, as is so often done, merely suppress the most outstanding\\n      symptom by an appropriate drug; for example giving an anodyne to mask the\\n      pain or removing the skin eruption by some strong local application, in\\n      other words putting the dust under the mat and pretending the room is\\n      clean.\\n      \\n Strangely enough the homoeopathic\\n      physician is often accused by his allopathic critic in his ignorance of\\n      Homoeopathy, of merely treating symptoms, whereas it is the critic himself\\n      who practices this superficial medicine. The homoeopathic physician, on\\n      the other hand, treats his patient as a whole through his symptoms and\\n      their modifications through changes in the environment, which is quite a\\n      different matter.\\n      \\n Homoeopathic therapy, unlike methods of\\n      treatment, is based on a natural law \"Similia Similibus\\n      Curentur\" \"Likes may be cured by likes\" which has been\\n      proved time and time again by experiment and which anyone with the will to\\n      do may prove for himself. It is not subject to constant change brought\\n      about by this or that latest discovery, and which itself will soon have to\\n      give way to the still later idea.\\n      \\n Having now introduced to you our actor,\\n      what of the scene in which he is to play his role?\\n      \\n This is the nineteen hundred and fifty\\n      - fourth year of the Christian era and the second year of the reign of our\\n      much loved and admired young Queen Elizabeth II, who will remember while\\n      in south Africa on her twenty - first birthday, before she had any idea\\n      that she would so soon be called to such an exalted position as she holds\\n      today, broadcast to the commonwealth and Empire her resolve to dedicate\\n      her life to the service of this grand community which dedication she\\n      recently repeated at her Coronation.\\n      \\n Here in Great Britain we have a more or\\n      less complete welfare state, with which idea some of us may very strongly\\n      disagree, whilst others believe such a development is the result of a\\n      natural very desirable social evolution.\\n      \\n As one necessary ingredient of this\\n      welfare state came, in 1948, the initiation of the National Health\\n      Service, through which the great majority of the population receives its\\n      medical attention, although it is rightly available to all.\\n      \\n When we come to consider the role that\\n      homoeo - therapeutics should play in this scheme, I would suggest that we\\n      should regard the problem from the purely medical aspect, forgetting any\\n      political party allegiances or sympathies we may have; or if we cannot\\n      forget them we should remember that the organization of the National\\n      Insurance Scheme of which the National Health Service is but a part, was\\n      first blue printed by the well - known Liberal supporter, Lord Beveridge,\\n      and the Health Service plans developed by the Coalition Government of all\\n      three major political parties.\\n      \\n We are living at present in an age\\n      which may very justifiably be regarded as a violent age in which have been\\n      developed so many appalling instruments of destruction, the use of some of\\n      which we are quite complacently accepting and from the use of others we\\n      are refraining, not because we consider them immoral, but simply through\\n      the fear of the wholesale destruction which would be caused by their use.\\n      We are seeing X-rays used in very high voltages in the treatment of\\n      cancer, we are being constantly remained of the use of dangerous drugs in\\n      medicine, without justification, in my opinion, bearing in mind the\\n      doubtful and evanescent ameliorations they produce and the violent\\n      surgical treatment of mental patients.\\n      \\n One further violence we should not\\n      forget is the way some of our foods are devitalized by the extraction of\\n      this or that portion of the natural product for purposes quite foreign to\\n      the well - being of the people who are to feed on them; or they are\\n      contaminated by the addition of this or that dangerous chemical, either\\n      during the growing of the plant, in the form of sprays, or as so called\\n      improvers in, for instance, the manufacture of white bread. It is very\\n      significant in this regard that quite a lot of attention is paid to the\\n      protection of the man who sprays the crops, but the right of the consumer\\n      to have uncontaminated food is slurred over by the unjustifiable statement\\n      that the amount of these chemicals so consumed is so small that it cannot\\n      have any bad effect on the consumer. We who practice Homoeopathy know how\\n      unwarranted is such a statement.\\n      \\n Can we homoeopathic physicians and\\n      patient hope to be able to do anything to make the still small voice of\\n      Homoeopathy heard in all this tumult, so that we may return to a saner and\\n      more healthful way of life and help our young Queen in her lifes work for\\n      the communitys sake?\\n      \\n Can we expect any help from the leaders\\n      of the medical profession? I am afraid not, because although I believe it\\n      accurate to state that there is a very slowly growing interest in, and\\n      tolerance of our work by individual doctors, the medical authorities are\\n      still, in their prejudice, strongly opposed to us. The London University\\n      still refuses to recognize our Hospital as a post - graduate teaching\\n      Hospital: the British Medical Association prohibits the formation of a\\n      homoeopathic section of its organization, and the Royal College of\\n      Physicians still refuses its membership to any one known as a homoeopathic\\n      physician. Yet in spite of this unfavourable environment, I firmly believe\\n      that there is a future for our method of therapeutics: but it will have to\\n      be pursued with courage, determination, foresight and energy. Surely if we\\n      believe as I do, that we are the guardians of a system of treatment\\n      destined to make our people healthier and therefore more efficient and\\n      happier, we would be failing in our duty to our country if we did not take\\n      every means in our power to acquaint the community at large with the\\n      advantages of this system and the dangers of ignoring it. This is a duty,\\n      not only of the profession, but also of the laity interested in\\n      Homoeopathy and who have experienced its benefits.\\n      \\n Every physician has two professional\\n      obligation to the community, that of preserving its health and that of\\n      endeavouring to restore it to being when it has fallen by the way.\\n      \\n The homoeopathic physician, thorough\\n      his knowledge acquired through the provings of drugs, even in\\n      infinitesimal doses, has, I believe, a very special responsibility as\\n      regards the prophylaxis of disease. It seems to me that a great deal of\\n      chronic ill health may quite conceivably be due to the manipulations of\\n      our foods and to the artificial manuring of the ground in which many of\\n      them are grown. Experiments have been carried our proving that plants\\n      grown in soil enriched by natural manuring, are much less prone to\\n      diseases than those grown with the help of artificial chemical manures. It\\n      seems a fairly justified conclusion that vegetables grown under these\\n      artificial conditions may quite well be deficient in something necessary\\n      for our perfect health. It is therefore incumbent upon the physician to\\n      advocate whenever possible the ingestion of healthily grown foods in the\\n      widest sense of that term.\\n      \\n The same duty applies when we consider\\n      the great amount of drugging in which the community at large indulges by\\n      its excessive smoking, particularly when aggravated by the practice of\\n      inhaling, and by the continued and prolonged use of drugs for this or that\\n      symptom, too often, unfortunately, though not always, on the prescription\\n      of their medical advisors.\\n      \\n There is a great lack throughout the\\n      community of any real enthusiasm for perfect health: we are only too prone\\n      to be content to follow like sheep, the unintelligent and harmful\\n      practices of the majority of our fellows.\\n      \\n Similarly in the curative realm, we\\n      homoeopathic physicians have special obligations.\\n      \\n When considering our position vis-a-vis\\n      the rest of the profession, we must never lose sight of the fact that our\\n      approach to the sick individual is a much broader and more comprehensive\\n      one than that of the dominant school. This latter prides itself on its\\n      scientific approach to its problems. One must, however, always be on ones\\n      guard against being hypnotized by that word scientific. The scientific\\n      aspect of any phenomenon or problem dealing with humanity is only one\\n      limited aspect of that problem. To get a complete picture one must\\n      consider other aspect, such as the aesthetic, emotional, maybe religious,\\n      and above all, perhaps one might say embracing all, the philosophical\\n      approach. This complex approach to his patients problem is the one that\\n      the homoeopathic physician always strives to adopt, and so never loses\\n      sight of the ego of the patient, while at the same time not forgetting his\\n      physical make - up.\\n      \\n Because this approach of ours to our\\n      patients is a much broader and more comprehensive one than the much\\n      vaunted scientific aspect, which the dominant school has come to regard as\\n      the Ultima Thule of medicine, I deplore the oft - repeated request of some\\n      of my colleagues that we should forsake our philosophy and make our work\\n      as scientific as theirs. I do not mean to imply by this that we should\\n      neglect the scientific angle of our patients illness but we should always\\n      remember that is only one facet of our problem. That is why we take such\\n      pains to diagnose our patients personality with his reaction to his\\n      environment in addition to the physical diagnosis of the case in order to\\n      arrive at our prescription for his malady. In other words, we should\\n      endeavour to lead our dominant school colleagues to our way of thinking,\\n      rather than that we should adopt theirs.\\n      \\n At the same time must always remember\\n      that if our philosophy should seem at any time to contradict so - called\\n      scientific laws, we must re - examine our philosophy, and if necessary\\n      modify it, while at the same time remembering that many times in the past\\n      what have been regarded as laws have ultimately been proved not to be so.\\n      Thus it is evident that we must never relax our self - examination.\\n      \\n What shall be the role of the\\n      homoeopathic laity?\\n      \\n The first thing for them to remember is\\n      that we are living in a democratic country whose government is dependent\\n      on the goodwill of the governed, and that, if a sufficient number of\\n      voters desire a certain line of action, that line will be adopted by the\\n      government.\\n      \\n The second thought is that there are\\n      not nearly sufficient doctors practising Homoeopathy in Great Britain to\\n      satisfy the present demand, let alone any further increased demand in the\\n      future, for this line of treatment.\\n      \\n Does not this seem strange, having\\n      regard to the great advantage to humanity that Homoeopathy provides? Not\\n      if one looks below the surface and so finds the reason for this shortage.\\n      \\n Surely the most potent reason is that\\n      Homoeopathy is not taught in the official Medical Schools, either as a pre\\n      - or post - graduate study. The London University when asked to recognize\\n      the Royal London Homoeopathic Hospital as a post - graduate Medical\\n      School, refused on the plea that as Homoeopathy was not taught in the\\n      undergraduate Medical Schools, it could not find a place for it in its\\n      post - graduate curriculum.\\n      \\n It is, of course, nonsense to suggest\\n      that a graduate should pursue his studies only in those subject of which\\n      he had already obtained some knowledge in his undergraduate days and\\n      should not wish to obtain information on any new or extra subject.\\n      \\n The University Medical Shools are\\n      enabled to a great extent through Government grants. We must therefore\\n      find some way of influencing whatever Government be in power to bring\\n      pressure to bear upon the London University to remove this obstacle to the\\n      better health of the community at large. I am quite satisfied that once\\n      this academic recognition is obtained we shave many more post - graduate\\n      students of Homoeopathy.\\n      \\n I believe than in a democratic\\n      community, having a universal State Medical Service, it is the bounden\\n      duty of the Government to remove all obstacles to the peoples obtaining\\n      that form of medical treatment in which they have confidence. So long as\\n      Homoeopathy is denied its legitimate status, so long must be Government be\\n      deemed to b failing in its duty to the country.\\n      \\n If, however, we are to achieve this\\n      desirable object of full recognition, we must all, professional and laity,\\n      be fired with enthusiasm, not only for the abstract cause of Homoeopathy,\\n      but for being partners with our young Queen in delicating our lives to the\\n      community.\\n      \\n When we do this we shall help to make\\n      this second Elizabethan era one to be remembered throughout the ages to\\n      come as surpassing the first Elizabethan era in that it gained not so much\\n      the economic and political leadership of the world - though that is not to\\n      be despised - but showed the way to the most healthful and spiritual way\\n      of life that all the world look notice and followed suit.\\n      \\n To sum up, the Role of Homoeopathy, as\\n      I see it, is to humanize the practice of medicine. By that I mean it must\\n      bring the practice of medicine into line with a reasoned philosophy of\\n      life, restore to it its artistry and rid it of all unnecessary hazards. It\\n      is to do this, not from any abstract academic sense of superiority, but in\\n      order the years to come are not those of merely another reign, but to\\n      ensure a veritable Renaissance, starting with the second Elizabethan era\\n      in which Great Britain will take its rightful place in the comity of\\n      nations as the pathfinder to a way of life for which posterity will be\\n      able to say \"Thank God for Queen Elizabeth the Second and her\\n      peoples.'\n",
      " 'Tresorie - Roentgenometric Pelvimetry [Roentgenometric Pelvimetry]\\n CHARLES W.PERKINS, M.D.\\n      \\n Norwalk, Conn\\n      \\n FOR some time the x-ray has been used\\n      to advantage in diagnosis of multiple pregnancy, position of fetus and\\n      fetal abnormalities. However, it has been only the past four or five years\\n      that any definite information has been obtained by roentgenographic\\n      methods of diagnoses in pelvimetry.\\n      \\n At the present time we are convinced\\n      that only by means of roentgenographs can be true proportions of the\\n      superior strait be determined, and that the ordinary external methods of\\n      Pelvimetry are not only occasionally misleading but proportionately\\n      inaccurate.\\n      \\n The present communication deals with\\n      the method of Herbert Thomas of Yale University. This method was developed\\n      in cooperation with the late Dr. W.A. Lafield, who was Professor of\\n      Roentgenology at the Yale Medical School.\\n      \\n Some of the reasons why roentgen\\n      pelvimetry has not been more universally adopted are probably due to the\\n      following factors.\\n      \\n (1) The majority of women will be\\n      delivered normally, whether or not pelvic measurements are made.\\n      \\n (2) The medical profession does not\\n      readily accept a new method after an established satisfactory routine has\\n      been in use.\\n      \\n (3) A new method of diagnosis incurs\\n      added expense.\\n      \\n (4) The present methods, although\\n      entirely speculative, are satisfactory in most cases.\\n      \\n (5) Roentgen pelvimetry cannot be\\n      performed by the obstetrician himself but requires the aid of a\\n      roentgenologist.\\n      \\n (6) The value of roentgenometric\\n      diagnosis is recent in origin and as yet not universally accepted.\\n      \\n If the knowledge of the size and shape\\n      of the pelvis is necessary to the practice of obstetrics, roentgen\\n      pelvimetry is a sound procedure, particularly in pre-emptors patients, and\\n      should and should be considered as an indispensable aid in these cases.\\n      \\n The method of Herbert Thoms as\\n      developed at Yale Medical School is not the only method. However, it can\\n      be classified as simple, accurate and rapid; being adaptable for use by\\n      other than experts in x-ray and obstetric diagnosis. As a technical\\n      procedure a well trained hospital technician can master its technic alter\\n      sufficient instruction.\\n      \\n Studies of recent years reveal the fact\\n      that external Pelvimetry fails to give uniform and accurate information in\\n      regard to the shape and size of the superior strait. This is often true of\\n      thin undersized individuals. In many patients of this type external\\n      measurements may suggest a contracted pelvis while the x-ray will show a\\n      relatively large pelvis with a subsequent natural labor and normal-sized\\n      child. On the other hand a stocky short person with similar external\\n      measurements will disclose a contracted pelvis which is an obstetric\\n      problem. Because of the apparent relationship between shortening of the\\n      transverse diameter and a secondary persistent occipito-posterior\\n      presentation, accurate information regarding this diameter is of clinical\\n      significance.\\n      \\n The observations of Thomas were made on\\n      twenty consecutive patients whose pelvis showed a relative or real\\n      shortening of the transverse diameter of the superior strait. In every\\n      instance a primary or secondary occipito posterior position was found\\n      after the patient was in labor. (Herbert Thoms, Surgery, Gynecology and\\n      Obstetrics, January, 1933). It therefore has been proved that an actual or\\n      relative shortening of a transverse diameter of the superior strait\\n      results in a limitation of space that is greater in the anterior than in\\n      the posterior half of the superior strait. Under these circumstances, when\\n      the head descends early in labor, the occiput is forced to rotate\\n      posteriorly.\\n      \\n The x-ray offers additional information\\n      in determining the size of the fetal head. It has been noted in x-ray\\n      examination of the unengaged fetal head that it lay with the transverse\\n      diameter of the superior strait, the occiput being either to the right or\\n      left; therefore, if roentgenogram of the patient is taken in the supine\\n      position with the fetus in the uterus, it will cast a shadow which is an\\n      enlarged profile of the head. The measurements of the occipital frontal\\n      diameter of the head can then be made. On numerous occasions this method\\n      of cephalometry, determining the diameter of the unmoulded head before and\\n      after cesarean section, has yielded accurate results. (Thomas, A.M.A.,\\n      February 24, 1934).\\n      \\n As experience increases in roentgen\\n      pelvimetry, the so-called labor test will be employed less. This, however,\\n      does not mean that the physician should not under estimate the importance\\n      of uterine contraction and the ability of the fetal head to mold. It has\\n      always followed that when something could be proved desirable in medicine\\n      for the better protection of the patient, such an advance would be\\n      demanded and eventually become routine. We may concede, therefore, that\\n      roentgen pelvimetry has a distinct place in the examination of every\\n      primiparous woman. In many instances, according to Thomas and others,\\n      external; measurements were normal but the x-ray examination revealed a\\n      contracted pelvis. On the other had, in certain patients whose external\\n      measurements suggested a cesarean section roentgen pelvimetry proved\\n      otherwise and they were subsequently delivered in a normal manner.\\n      \\n CENTIMETER GRID METHOD.\\n      \\n The procedure in this method may be\\n      summarized by stating the following:.\\n      \\n (1) The patient is placed on the\\n      roentgenographic table in the semi- recumbent position.\\n      \\n (2) The level of the superior strait\\n      above the sensitized film is established.\\n      \\n (3) The tube target is centered about\\n      five centimeters posterior to the symphysis, at thirty-two inches from the\\n      sensitized film, The exposure is made.\\n      \\n (4) The patient is removed from the\\n      table, the tube target and sensitized film remaining in situ.\\n      \\n (5) A lead plate, or centimeter grid,\\n      with perforations exactly one centimeter apart, is introduced into the\\n      same plane as that previously occupied by the superior strait and a second\\n      (flash) exposure is made on the same sensitized film as was used used in\\n      the previous exposure.\\n      \\n (6) Development of the film shows the\\n      outline of the superior strait and the shadows of the perforations, the\\n      assistance between which represents centimeters in the plane of the\\n      superior strait. The anteroposterior and transverse diameters of the\\n      superior strait in its use proportions may be drawn on centimeter-square\\n      paper by following the course of the shadow of the superior strait and\\n      transcribing it.\\n      \\n As this time I wish to express my\\n      thanks to Dr. Thoms for his personal advice and instruction which helped\\n      me to master the technic of his method.'\n",
      " 'Tresorie - NOTATU DIGNUM [Test Of A Homoeopath]\\n\\n Complaints are not unfrequently made\\n      that the homoeopathic materia medica is too vast for practical utility;\\n      that the schematised list of symptoms are unprofitable, if not impossible\\n      reading.

Indeed, I think that the test of a genuine\\n      homoeopath might not unfairly be said to life in his capacity to read\\n      through a Schema with both profit and enjoyment because of the\\n      possibilities it reveals of dealing with cases occurring every day in\\n      practice.

      " 'Tresorie - THE EFFICACY OF THE VIBROMETER IN APPLYING VIBRATORY MASSAGE\\nIN AURAL DISEASES [Efficacy Of Vibrometer In Applying Vibratory Message In Aural\\nDisease]\\n\\n SINCE presenting my paper before the\\n      American Institute, in June of last year on \"Vibratory Motion as a\\n      Method of Massage in Aural Diseases,\" I have been using an instrument\\n      specially devised for that purpose called the \"vibrometer.\" This\\n      instrument is in shape like a banjo, and has four strings stretched across\\n      its length resting on a bridge, which sets upon a diaphragm. On each side,\\n      elevated above the diaphragm and supported by posts, are two horizontal\\n      bars, which support the mechanical appliances used for producing the\\n      various vibratory motions. This consists in what is called a yoke, in\\n      which revolves a shaft connected with the electro-motor by pulley-wheels\\n      and a belt. Behind the diaphragm is a shallow air-tight compartment,\\n      leading from which are rubber tubes that are inserted in the external\\n      auditory canal during treatment, consequently any vibratory motion of the\\n      diaphragm, which must necessarily be an inward and a corresponding outward\\n      movement, would be exactly reproduced upon the membrana tympani, as the\\n      confined air, not being able to escape, will undergo an alternate\\n      condensation and rarefication in the external auditory canal.\\n      \\n Every vibratory movement of the strings\\n      of the instrument is communicated to the diaphragm by means of the bridge\\n      upon which it rests. These strings by varying their tension and length can\\n      be regulated to give a high or low rate of vibration as desired, for\\n      instance, the heaviest string left at its original length adjusted to a\\n      slight tension may make about fifty vibratory motions to the second, while\\n      the highest string on the instrument adjusted to a high tension and\\n      clamped down to one-fourth its original length would probably make three\\n      thousand vibratory motions to the second.\\n      \\n In the centre of the diaphragm is an\\n      attachment which works on a lever, and when hit by the cam on the\\n      revolving shaft lifts the diaphragm to a considerable extent, causing a\\n      powerful effect on the membrana tympani. This attachment can be adjusted\\n      at four different leverages, which causes a modification or increase of\\n      its intensity and can be regulated at from one to twenty-five vibratory\\n      movements to the second. This is only used in very bad cases and for not\\n      more than five minutes continuously.\\n      \\n The instrument which I have been\\n      describing in an improvement on the first manufactured, and as far as I\\n      know, is the only one which offers the same facilities for applying this\\n      method of massage. The class of patients in my experience who are\\n      generally benefited from the first, are those in which the mucous membrane\\n      lining the tympanic cavity and Eustachian tubes is in a hypertrophic\\n      condition. The membrana tympani are depressed, opaque, and thickened. They\\n      usually complain of a stiffed sensation in the ears, with a great deal of\\n      tinnitus aurium, and that their hearing is worse during a cold. In cases\\n      where the mucous membranes are atrophied with a large external auditory\\n      canal perfectly dry and Eustachian tubes patulous, and generally very\\n      little tinnitus, this or no other treatment has done very much good in the\\n      majority of cases, and in looking ever my records I find that only about\\n      five per cent. have been relieved, while in the before-mentioned cases the\\n      good results reach at least seventy-five per cent. In treating persons, I\\n      always select the rate of vibration which corresponds in pitch, if\\n      possible, to that caused by the diseased condition of the ears. If there\\n      is no tinnitus to guide me, I find whether the patient can hear a high or\\n      low sound better; if it is a low sound, a high rate of vibration is used\\n      in treatment, and vice versa, A point which I would like to explain here\\n      is this: It is not necessary that the sound from the instrument should be\\n      of the same quality of the tinnitus experienced by the patient, but merely\\n      the same pitch. for instance, if a banjo, where one of the strings was\\n      adjusted when sounded to produce a certain note, and a musical instrument\\n      of any other kind, whose quality of tone was entirely different, was made\\n      to sound the same note in a room, the string on the banjo would vibrate in\\n      sympathy, which has been proven by experiment, any other note, no matter\\n      how loud, would have no effect. Another point is in the way the strings of\\n      the vibrometer are set in motion. On the revolving shaft is a wheel\\n      projecting from which are metallic picks which hit the string it is\\n      adjusted over. It does not make any difference in the number of vibratory\\n      motions per second, whether the string is hit fast or slow, but at the\\n      time the string is first hit the intensity is greater than it is just\\n      before being hit again, and as the motion of the wheel is perfectly\\n      rhythmic, revolving so many times to the second, it has just as good an\\n      effect as if the intensity during the fraction of a second did not vary at\\n      all. The idea of using vibratory motion, as I have said before, originated\\n      within my mind some years ago, and later put into practical operation, and\\n      as far as I know, was the first to lay before the profession in a\\n      scientific manner, this method of massage.\\n      \\n I have found that when two of the\\n      strings upon the vibrometer were regulated in such a way that when both\\n      were set in vibration at the same time, producing the sensation of a\\n      harmonious sound, the effect in some cases on the tinnitus was especially\\n      beneficial, relieving, where the various kinds of vibrations produced by a\\n      single string failed. Sub-acute cases of deafness, accompanied by tinnitus\\n      aurium, are quickly relieved, as the following case will illustrate:.\\n      \\n Mrs. M. Young, married lady, aet. 26,\\n      called at my office, April 1, 1893, complaining of partial deafness and\\n      tinnitus aurium. She had a stuffed sensation, or as if cotton had been\\n      packed in the external auditory canal. She says the tinnitus was so\\n      annoying as to prevent sleep. On examination, found considerable\\n      retraction of the membrana tympani, and hearing for the watch, on the\\n      right side five inches, on the left, seven inches. The Eustachian tube\\n      were partially closed, which made inflation somewhat difficult, giving\\n      slight relief. I used several of the vibrations on the different strings\\n      without immediate benefit.\\n      \\n April 4th.-She came again, and reported\\n      that no improvement had taken place. I again inflated her ears, after\\n      which she sat down to the vibrometer. The central attachment was used with\\n      considerable force continuously for four minutes, after which she declared\\n      that the tinnitus had entirely ceased in the right ear, and greatly\\n      modified in the left; the hearing for the watch had increased for both\\n      ears to fourteen inches, and the stuffed sensation had almost entirely\\n      disappeared. On inspection of the membrana tympani, found them\\n      comparatively very slightly retracted. On April 8th, found improvement had\\n      continued, when the same treatment was used for three minutes; after which\\n      she declared herself completely relieved of the tinnitus and stuffed\\n      sensation, with hearing powerfully restored. Saw her again on April 13th,\\n      when she declared the good results from last treatment to have still\\n      continued.\\n      \\n I find that in the majority of cases,\\n      when the strings of the instrument are used it is only necessary to strike\\n      them lightly with the friction wheel. In vibrating the heavy string, I\\n      generally set the bridge back behind the central attachment, and adjusting\\n      the motor in such way that the belt is at a considerable tension, so that\\n      the pulley-wheel revolves slowly. I also generally use this adjustment\\n      when setting in motion two strings at one time. The principle of this\\n      method of treatment embraces two essential features which to my mind makes\\n      this system of massage the only scientific one applicable to the membrana\\n      tympani and its associate sound-conducting parts. Message is the\\n      application of motion to disease, and its scientific administration\\n      consists of its application in a systematic manner. In applying massage in\\n      aural diseases, it is necessary to produce a to-and-fro movement of the\\n      membrana tympani, and, if possible, by a force which is harmless and at\\n      the same time effective. The vibrometer fulfils these conditions. Any of\\n      the strings on the instrument that may be set in motion by the\\n      friction-wheel, will produce a certain number of vibratory movements to\\n      the second of time, and the movements of the central attachment are also\\n      measured. What could be more systematic than this? The motions of the\\n      membrana tympani were intended by nature to its vibratory, and as the\\n      vibrometer generates measured motion, and these motions are vibratory,\\n      theoretically we have a scientific and effective method of massage in\\n      aural diseases; and, as demonstrated practically by the use of the\\n      vibrometer, we have in fact a great scientific advance over all previous\\n      methods. Since the introduction of this treatment in aural diseases, it\\n      makes possible a more or less benefit in cases of deafness heretofore\\n      considered hopeless, and has opened up the field for the treatment of\\n      aural diseases to such an extent that the number of deaf patients seeking\\n      relief at the aurist\\'s hands will at least double itself.\\n      \\n DISCUSSION.\\n      \\n H.C. HOUGHTON, M.D.: Dr. Garey\\'s\\n      admirable paper gives us the description of the vibrometer, an instrument\\n      devised under his personal direction and inspection, for the purpose of\\n      applying massage to the ear. It is the only instrument of the kind on the\\n      market, so far as I am aware, and after a somewhat prolonged use of it, I\\n      am prepared to recommend the latest production of the vibrometer company.\\n      \\n This instrument is a decided\\n      improvement over the instrument first sent out, and is capable of\\n      producing a most profound effect upon the drum-head and ossicula; indeed,\\n      upon the entire auditory apparatus. I am able to confirm Dr. Garey\\'s\\n      statement of the effect of high and low vibrations us regards treatment.\\n      \\n I have also been very much interested\\n      in the use of stringed or reed instruments for diagnosis, and find that we\\n      can detect any abnormal sensitiveness of the auditory nerve to high or low\\n      tones. Some patients are extremely sensitive to all tones, high or low;\\n      others to high tones and not to low tones; others, conversely. Again, in\\n      some instances, there is a peculiar sensitiveness to single tones or to\\n      discords produced by sounding the note and half-note at the same time.\\n      Under the action of the central attachment of the vibrometer this\\n      sensitiveness is modified, the sensitiveness to high tones disappearing\\n      and being replaced by a low tone or, conversely, under treatment, a low\\n      tone disappears and a high tone is established, temporarily, at least.\\n      Again, in cases of recent origin, treatment will substitute an undefined\\n      rushing sound for a definite musical tone, either high or low, and later,\\n      the treatment will abolish this, the patient being relieved of this\\n      intensely annoying symptom. In some cases, with this relief, there is an\\n      improvement in the audition; in other cases, no improvement follows.\\n      \\n I confess to the domination of the\\n      material over my mind in my earlier experience with massage, and I think\\n      the inclination of operators will be to use a far greater degree of power\\n      than is necessary. I therefore notice with great satisfaction Professor\\n      Garey\\'s remark that \"the object should be to produce a to-and-fro\\n      motion to the membrana tympani, and, if possible, by a force which is\\n      harmless and at the same time effective.\" I would hardly say\\n      \"to-and-fro motion of the drum-head,\" because I think that the\\n      expression is liable to perpetuate the motion which is fixed in the minds\\n      of most physiologists, that the drum-head moves as a whole, with a\\n      to-and-fro motion.\" That is true under the influence of the Politzer,\\n      Siegle\\'s otoscope and similar instruments; but it certainly does not so\\n      move in the ordinary function of audition, but stands as the iris does in\\n      the eye, as an adjustor, a regulator of sound-force; in some sense as the\\n      iris does in its relation with the lens, to adjust, regulate and direct\\n      the essential force, and the vibration of the drum-head is at every node;\\n      every portion receives impressions that are converted into molecular\\n      disturbances of varying lengths, according as they are produced upon the\\n      stiff and unyielding portions of the drum-head at the periphery, along the\\n      manubrium, or in the more attenuated and easily-yielding portions which\\n      the between these two areas. Not only so, but these impulses are\\n      communicated to the contained air of the tympanum, and make their\\n      impression upon the acoustic nerve through the round window synchronously\\n      with the impression made through the ossicula.\\n      \\n This whole subject widens before my\\n      mind in such a way that one might wish himself twenty years and at liberty\\n      to devote himself to a term of research in acoustics, such as is offered\\n      only in the technical schools of the continent of Europe.\\n      \\n WM. R. KING, M.D.: In discussing Dr.\\n      Garey\\'s paper I shall begin by saying that his methods have been closely\\n      followed by me since the beginning of his experiments, owing to the fact\\n      that I have been greatly interested in the treatment of deafness and\\n      tinnitus by means of sound waves or by aural massage since 1887, and have\\n      experimented and treated many cases by this method since then, though with\\n      crude and unsatisfactory instruments. Since using the vibrometer-which,\\n      after much study and experimentation, is now presented to the profession\\n      in practical shape-I have undoubtedly increased my percentage of good\\n      results.\\n      \\n I don\\'t believe I am over-sanguine or\\n      carried away by interest in this method, and believe I can rightly\\n      appreciate that this does not offer us a panacea or cure-all for auditory\\n      ailments, and hope I may always be ready to see the failures and to strive\\n      to find methods or remedies to reach some of them.\\n      \\n In speaking of the application of the\\n      instrument, I wish to call attention to the central attachment or post foe\\n      vibrations. Dr. Garey has not given it as much attention in the paper as\\n      it deserves. It is very useful as a general means of aural massage,\\n      rougher in nature and more general in application than the strings which\\n      help to make up the instrument. I often use it before applying the\\n      \"similar found\" to a given case, as a species of gymnastics, to\\n      stimulate secretion and motion in the conducting apparatus of the ear,\\n      viz., membrana tympani and ossicles. In most cases-in fact, in all-where\\n      tinnitus is present, I follow this up immediately by the nearest approach\\n      to the similar pitch obtainable.\\n      \\n I agree thoroughly with Dr. Garey, that\\n      the best results are achieved in cases accompanying hypertrophic catarrh,\\n      and that the least benefit is apparent in cases of atrophic nature.\\n      \\n Regarding the method of treatment in\\n      the absence of tinnitus, my experience the does not coincide with that of\\n      the author of the paper entirely; I do not feel that as yet we have any\\n      safe rule to guide us. My method has been to try the numerous sounds and\\n      variations the of until I find the one that seems to give the best\\n      immediate results, or that the patient himself will speak of as very\\n      penetrating and powerful )though not necessarily loud and heavy).\\n      \\n It seems almost impossible at present\\n      to simulate all the qualities of tone as they occur in the ears of those\\n      suffering with tinnitus; in fact, it would appear to be unnecessary.\\n      However, it seems advantageous and quite necessary to secure the closest\\n      simulation of pitch, thus in many cases soon obliterating annoying\\n      tinnitus and improving hearing powers.\\n      \\n The arrangement permitting of the\\n      picking of two strings simultaneously adds decidedly the usefulness of the\\n      instrument, as it increases the range of pitch as well as varying the\\n      quality of tones procurable, thereby decidedly enlarging our field of\\n      application.\\n      \\n The force used for creating the message\\n      or gymnastics of the membrana tympani and the ossicles-viz, vibratory\\n      force or sound- carefully and scientifically applied, is nature\\'s remedy,\\n      because it is adapted by nature, and is the only force which can rightly\\n      or safely be applied to these delicate portions of this complex organ of\\n      hearing.\\n      \\n A startling commentary on this subject\\n      is the array of cases benefited who have been relegated to the shelf by\\n      ancient and modern otology; cases declared unhelpable have been vastly\\n      improved. Pray, make no mistake; I did not say all cases.\\n      \\n It may be interesting to hear the\\n      latest regarding the instrument which was first invented for the\\n      application of this method of aural massage Mr. E.J. Godman, the inventor\\n      and patentee, is constantly on the lookout, and always striving for\\n      improvements to his machine. He has made many that you all know of. Permit\\n      me to report a few so recent they have not yet left the factory.\\n      \\n First.-The machine has been taken from\\n      its case, and is now mounted on a solid stand or table of oak, being set\\n      below the level, or so that the face of the instrument is just level with\\n      the face of the table. This is all supported by rigid, solid metal legs,\\n      which absolutely prevent foreign vibrations.\\n      \\n Second.-The motor has been removed from\\n      its little shelf and relegated below the table. I t can be placed upon a\\n      box on the floor, a shelf against the wall, or, better yet, a shelf\\n      solidly attached to the metal supports of the table. A belt goes up\\n      through an aperture to a wheel on a shaft, the other extremity of which\\n      carries a wheel with a rubber tire (a friction wheel), which in its\\n      revolution, being in contact with a larger flat- surfaced wheel on the\\n      main shaft of the instrument, turns this in harmony with itself. This\\n      arrangement does away with the necessity of shifting the motor each time\\n      you wish to shift the carriage from one string to another- a consummation\\n      to be devoutly thankful for. The removal of the motor from the instrument\\n      as at present attached will recommend itself to all who have used the\\n      vibrometer, a great amount of undesirable jar being thus avoided.\\n      \\n Third.-Ratchet keys capable of very\\n      fine adjustment of tension of strings are now provided for the instrument.\\n      \\n Fourth.-A rheostadt or resistance-coil\\n      is now to be placed beneath the table between the storage battery and the\\n      switch, by this means enabling us to control the speed and number of\\n      revolutions to a nicety.\\n      \\n Other, though comparatively minor,\\n      improvements are being made, and others are contemplated, as, for\\n      instance, the substitution of a roughly corrugated rubber band for the\\n      picker on the wheel, thereby getting rid of the metallic sound of the\\n      picker on the wire strings.\\n      \\n I have experimented with a number of\\n      appliance for the production of the sounds and pitches that I have\\n      required, but I always fall back on the vibrometer, especially as at\\n      present constructed, for satisfactory work and results.\\n      \\n This instrument may be, and probably\\n      is, as yet, in its infancy. It, and the method it applies, can only be\\n      perfected by constant work and experimentation both on the part of the\\n      profession and of the manufacturers. Each improvement we can suggest, if\\n      it only should serve as a means of helping one solitary case, would be\\n      well worth our while.\\n      \\n The experiments being made by different\\n      methods for treating deafness by sound waves is indicative of the interest\\n      the profession has taken in the matter. It is indicative of a lack of\\n      something in our usual armamentarium which is greatly longed for by\\n      patient and doctor; that is, the means for making the deaf hear and for\\n      relieving distressing tinnitus. There has been a dearth in this direction,\\n      and perhaps there still is, but I believe fully that we have in aural\\n      massage by vibratory force a decided acquisition at our hands.\\n      \\n E. H. LINNELL., M.D.: I would simply\\n      like to ask Dr. King how long he uses the instrument, and whether he uses\\n      it according to the deafness.\\n      \\n DR. KING: Yes, decidedly. In an intense\\n      case of deafness I would have to use it a great deal longer. The central\\n      attachment I never carry over three or five minutes, and the whole\\n      treatment I don\\'t think is over carried over twenty or twenty-five minutes\\n      in one case, and usually averages from ten to fifteen.\\n      \\n HAROLD WILSON, M.D.: I have only to\\n      suggest, what I have elsewhere called attention to, the possibility of\\n      another mechanical device for securing vibratory motion. It is well known\\n      that in the make and break of a current of electricity, in the circuit of\\n      which there is a telephone, we get an influence upon the make and break of\\n      the current in the telephone. Now, it is a simple matter with which these\\n      makes and breaks are made as to obtaining any number of vibration that you\\n      wish. You may, by a mechanical device of some rotary motion, if you\\n      choose, make and break the current as rapidly as you please until you have\\n      reached several thousand vibrations a second, or you may even make the\\n      vibrations so slow us to be easily counted. The application of this\\n      suggestion has been put in force in my own practice, more or less, in the\\n      use of the telephone as connected with the induction-coil ordinary\\n      battery. The more intense the current, the more intense the sound. You can\\n      easily see that it is mere question of mechanics to secure these two\\n      sounds-intensity of vibration and rapidity of vibration. I will say,\\n      furthermore, that it has this advantage. There is no noise in the office,\\n      which I think is not altogether true of the vibrometer. I would suggest\\n      that so far as the vibrometer is concerned, if it could be made to be\\n      noiseless to anybody but the patient, it would be a decided improvement.\\n      In that respect the telephone is a decided improvement, because there is\\n      no noise except to the patient, because the noise is right at the ear of\\n      the patient. If I were seeking for a perfected instrument in this line, I\\n      would go outside of the banjo idea. As we have the most perfect writing\\n      machines, which have no connection with the ordinary method of writing,\\n      and sewing machines, which have no connection with sewing by hand, so it\\n      occurs to me that possibly the securing of he vibratory motion upon the\\n      ears might be obtained in a totally different way from that which you get\\n      when you listen to the drum of the guitar or an ordinary musical\\n      instrument, and I would suggest that the make and break of a telephone\\n      open a very fruitful field for mechanical experimentation.\\n      \\n H.C. HOUGHTON, M.D.: In my study of\\n      this subject I made the acquaintance of Mr. Bernhardt, of New York City,\\n      who is a personal friend of Mr. Emil Berliner, the inventor of the Emil\\n      Berliner Telephone, which is the instrument by which the Bell Telephone\\n      Company maintain their monopoly at present. Mr. Berliner is the inventor\\n      of the graphophone, and has, I think, covered this whole matter which Dr.\\n      Wilson has mentioned. As ordinary Bell telephone receiver is put into the\\n      circuit of an ordinary induction machine, and you can use it just as the\\n      English people use the audiometer, and as you remove the coil you modify\\n      the vibrations, which is covered with another disk and a tube, and that\\n      tube covered with a stethoscope tube, which is the same as we use for the\\n      phonograph or vibrometer, and, as Dr. Wilson has suggested, you can modify\\n      the intensity, and of course the whole matter is adjusted by the\\n      attachment of the cord, so that you can have fine vibrations. The\\n      intensity of the vibrations is regulated by the distance to which you\\n      uncover the cord. The only difficulty in the adjustment is that it has\\n      been so severe that it is really uncomfortable, and the noise of the\\n      instrument is reduced to the minimum for office use.\\n      \\n A.B. NORTON, M.D.: I will also add that\\n      in regard to the objection Dr. Wilson makes to the noise, there is no\\n      doubt it is an annoying thing in the office, and in that line I have some\\n      men at work on my suggestion. We are devising another machine, or\\n      instrument, which is to be entirely enclosed in a cabinet, so there will\\n      be no noise whatever in the room if it is made a success. The idea is a\\n      little crude, and I am quite uncertain whether it will amount to anything\\n      or not. Then, in the line of what Dr. King was speaking in regard to Mr.\\n      Goodwin-he called, at New York, to see me last week. I made two little\\n      suggestion to him, which I think would be in line with his advancement.\\n      One is the number of the picks. The present vibrometer has four picks I\\n      suggest the experiment of trying twelve or sixteen picks, which will make\\n      a more continuous sound; it may be of some value. Then, in regard to\\n      regulating the speed of the machine: you regulate that now by a series of\\n      buttons, so as to get three different speeds. We will have a very slight,\\n      intermediate speed, and a very rapid speed. My experience with the\\n      vibrometer is especially favorable. I think the idea is in the right\\n      direction, and it is simply a matter of instrumentation.']\n",

Dietary sources of vitamin C include fruits and vegetables, particularly citrus fruits such as oranges.Severe deficiency of vitamin C causes scurvy. Although rare, scurvy results in severe symptoms and can cause death. People with scurvy are treated with vitamin C and should be under medical supervision.Many uses for vitamin C have been proposed, but evidence of benefit in scientific studies is lacking. In particular, research on asthma, cancer, and diabetes remains inconclusive, and a lack of benefit has been found for the prevention of cataracts or heart disease.The use of vitamin C in the prevention or treatment of colds remains controversial. Extensive research has been conducted. Overall, vitamin C lacked an effect on the development of colds and on cold symptoms. However, the duration of the cold shortened slightly. Notably, people living in extreme circumstances, including soldiers in the subarctic, skiers, and marathon runners, had a 50% decrease in the risk of developing a cold. This area merits additional research and may be of particular interest to athletes or people in the military.'\n",

Vitamin B12 is frequently used in combination with other B vitamins in a vitamin B complex formulation. Vitamin B12 is important in DNA synthesis. Vitamin B12 is bound to the protein in food. Acid in the stomach releases B12 from protein during digestion. Once released, B12 combines with a substance called intrinsic factor (IF) before it is absorbed into the bloodstream.The human body stores several years\\' worth of vitamin B12 in the liver, so low levels in the body are rare. Decreases in vitamin B12 levels are more common in the elderly, HIV-infected persons, and vegetarians.

Arginine is also found in many foods that have protein.Arginine becomes nitric oxide (a blood vessel-widening agent called a vasodilator) in the body. Early evidence suggests that arginine may help treat medical conditions that improve with increased vasodilation. These conditions include chest pain, atherosclerosis (clogged arteries), heart disease, heart failure, erectile dysfunction, peripheral vascular disease, and headaches from blood vessel swelling).Arginine also triggers the body to make protein and has been studied for healing wounds, bodybuilding, enhancing sperm production, and preventing tissue wasting in people with critical illnesses. However, caution is warranted. Arginine use was associated with death in some people with heart conditions. Caution is also needed when using arginine to treat pre-eclampsia (high blood pressure in pregnancy).Arginine hydrochloride has been used to treat metabolic alkalosis. This use should be under the supervision of a qualified healthcare professional.'\n",
      " 'Flaxseed and flaxseed oil (or linseed oil) are rich sources of the essential fatty acid alpha-linolenic acid (ALA). In the body, some ALA is converted to omega-3 fatty acids.Lignans are a type of plant hormone similar to estrogen. The lignan components of flaxseed (not flaxseed oil) may possess antioxidant properties and alter estrogen activity.As a source of fiber, flaxseed (not flaxseed oil) has laxative properties. In large doses, or when taken without enough water, flaxseed may cause bowel obstruction. The effects of flaxseed on blood sugar levels are unclear.Flaxseed oil contains only the ALA component of flaxseed and not the fiber or lignan components. Therefore, flaxseed oil may share the potential cholesterol-lowering properties of flaxseed, but not the proposed laxative or anticancer abilities.'\n",

      " 'Tresorie - The Present Status of Radiation in the Treatment of Malignant\\nConditions [Present Status Of Radiation in the Treatment Of Malignant\\nConditions]\\n ISIDORE ARONS, M.D.\\n      \\n New York, N.Y.\\n      \\n AT A meeting of the American Medical\\n      Association recently held in Cleveland, Dr. Joseph C.Bloodgood, in\\n      discussing a paper on radiation therapy, said that \"report at my\\n      clinic told me that 49 per cent of the patients previously operated on in\\n      the clinic now to for radiotherapy. This is based on results. They are not\\n      hopeless cases; they are still hopeful and they get well under\\n      radiotherapy. This has happened during the last three years, not because I\\n      have changed any but because the method of radiotherapy has changed. A\\n      great change has taken place. First of all, radium and x-rays are no\\n      longer looked on a last resort.\".\\n      \\n The foregoing bears witness to the\\n      progress made in the field radiation therapy. The manufacture of more\\n      adequate apparatus and the improved technic in its use reflect this\\n      improvement. Machines are used generally delivering twenty to thirty\\n      milliamperes of current at 200 K.V., while machines operating at 750 to\\n      1,000 200 K.V., using lower milliamperes, have been installed in several\\n      places in this country. Since the question of increased voltages began to\\n      dominate the field, machines operating at 400 to 600 K.V., using sealed\\n      tubes, have been manufactured in this country as well as on the been\\n      manufactured in this country as well as on the continent. This higher\\n      powered machines occupy little more space than the usual 200 K.V. machine.\\n      \\n The effectiveness of these stronger\\n      radiations is thought to be due to (1) the increased penetration and its\\n      consequently larger percentage depth doses, (2) the supposed higher\\n      selective action of short have length radiation on malignant cells, and\\n      (3) greatly increased x-ray output. Clinics using super-voltages report\\n      that clinical results are somewhat better than those secured through the\\n      use of the lesser voltage machine.\\n      \\n Experimental effort, from the physical\\n      and biologic point of view, has been exerted to establish to standard\\n      basis for radiotherapy since Roentgens discovery thirtyfive years ago, and\\n      its application five years later. Radiotherapists have only recently begun\\n      to understand the principles of clinical application or radiotherapy in\\n      the treatment of malignant conditions.\\n      \\n Regaud selected the rabbits testicle\\n      for his experiments because its histologic cellular structure was highly\\n      sensitive to radiation, containing cells which are in a state of active\\n      mitosis resembling that of malignant tissue. In 1922, Regaud reported that\\n      of malignant, tissue. In 1922, Regaud reported that it was impossible to\\n      sterilize the testicle by a single dose of radiation without causing\\n      serious damage to the overlying skin. The dose required to produced such\\n      radio necrosis was equivalent to about three radionecrosis was equivalent\\n      to about three erythemas when administered in one dose. However, by\\n      dividing the dose in such a manner as to prolong the treatment over a\\n      period of fourteen days, a total dose of about five erythemas could be\\n      given causing complete sterilizations without damage to the skin. Thus it\\n      is seen that by prolonging the time of treatment the cutaneous dose could\\n      be increased nearly 50 per cent without causing necrosis.\\n      \\n The above experiments were reported,\\n      and the same results determined, by Schinz and Slotopolsky in 1926, and\\n      again by Regaud and Ferroux in 1927. These experiments formed the\\n      foundation for the clinical studies of Pfahler (America), Hohlfelder\\n      (Germany) and Coutard (France), who have swung the pendulum from massive\\n      radiation, as advocated by the German school, to that of the protected\\n      fractional dose method. Results have been achieved by this method which\\n      are superior to previously reported; these are obtained by the improved\\n      method of administering a large dose to the (3 days) without causing\\n      destructive effects to the surroundings normal structure (or cancer bed);\\n      its effect are rather biologic than physical. The clinical application of\\n      the method of radiation by Pfahler, Countard, and Berven (Sweden) in the\\n      treatment of cancer of the tonsil, pharynx and larynx and have proved the\\n      radio-sensitive properties of squamous carcinoma, previously considered\\n      incapable of of responding to radiation.\\n      \\n According to Coutard, the neoplasm is\\n      exposed to x-rays twice daily, giving a total dose of 350 r to400 r to two\\n      areas, using 190 to 200 k.v., four milliamperes, two millimeters of copper\\n      and three millimeters of aluminum filtration at a distance of fifty of\\n      sixty centimeters, for lesion of the head and neck. For deeply situated\\n      lesions, such as cancer of the uterus, the focal distance varies from 80\\n      to 100 centimeters, the area of the field for the head and neck conditions\\n      being only 50 to 100 square centimeters, while those of the lower abdomen\\n      require on an average of 250 to 300 square centimeters. For the\\n      sterilization of the radio-sensitive squamous carcinomatous growth, a\\n      depth dose of 3,000 r to 4,000 r is given, while stronger dose is\\n      necessary for the radio-resistant tumors.\\n      \\n In the course of treatment of principle\\n      guides a radio reaction of the covering epithelium and the radio reaction\\n      of the cancer cells. The radio reaction of the cutaneous epithelium is\\n      called \"radio epidermitis.\"characterized by loss of epithelial\\n      layers and denudation of the dermis. The reaction of the mucous membrane ,\\n      called \"radio epithelitis,\" manifests itself by loss of the\\n      epithelial layer sand denudation of the mucous membrane, epithelial layers\\n      and denudation of the corium which becomes covered by a fibrinous and\\n      false membrane; of clear. The duration of both describe radio reactions is\\n      six weeks. Each appears at the beginning of three weeks and disappears at\\n      the beginning of the ninth week.\\n      \\n Should the total or daily dose or the\\n      intensity per minute be too high, or the filtration or the tension too\\n      low, the cancer bed would be modified. the nutrition of the malignant\\n      cells becomes impaired The cellular radio- sensitivity, which seems to be\\n      linked up not only with the mitosis of the cell but above all with the\\n      activity of their interchange with the cell but above all with the\\n      activity of their interchange with the surrounding normal structures,\\n      becomes diminished and at times suppressed. The cancer cells become\\n      incentive to radiation. This phenomenon is called \"radio-\\n      vaccination\" by Regaud.\\n      \\n Observation of clinical facts shows\\n      that changes in the surrounding normal tissue result from excessive daily\\n      doses and intensity per minute per minute causing radio resistance of the\\n      tissue. Conversely, radio- sensitivity would be prolonged with a smaller\\n      daily dosage and the resultant extended period.\\n      \\n Realizing that better results may be\\n      obtained by prolonged treatment, Coutard and his collaborators in the last\\n      few years have begun to extend the duration of treatment of certain\\n      so-called radio-resistant cancers from thirty to ninety days, giving weak\\n      daily doses in order of about 175, 220, 225 and 250 r per day, dividing\\n      the dose in two treatments. By this method he was able to cure a certain\\n      number of lesions on which he had not been able previously to obtain the\\n      same results, such as very differentiated epidermoid epithelioma invading\\n      the muscles and cartilages, glandular epithelioma of the breast ad the\\n      thyroid body, and special round celled epitheliomas of the upper part of\\n      the ethmoid and the adjacent sinuses. This mode of prolonged treatment not\\n      only controlled the condition locally but it lessened the frequency of\\n      metastasis.\\n      \\n When radiating a cancer of very\\n      embryonic, very radio-sensitive growths, the energy factor is predominant.\\n      The action of the x-rays seems to be direct and rapid; the treatment can\\n      be accomplished within fifteen to twenty days. The cells are destroyed and\\n      generally normal structures are affected very little. When radiating the\\n      less embryonic type of growths, the time of treatment should be longer.\\n      \\n Pursuing these general principles, I\\n      have adopted the Countard method with some slight modifications. The cures\\n      which I shall illustrate will show that the percentage of cures in a\\n      number of most dangerous epidermoid carcinomas has markedly increased and\\n      that some conditions formerly considered hopeless have been temporarily\\n      cured. In conclusion I wish to emphasize the following facts:.\\n      \\n (1) Cure of cancer by x-rays is still\\n      difficult and must not be entered into lightly and causally.\\n      \\n (2) Radiotherapy is just as radical in\\n      method as surgery, and requires great skill, judgment and experience.\\n      \\n (3) The cooperation of the pathologist\\n      and the radiotherapist is imperative for a proper estimate of the\\n      radio-sensitivity in relation to treatment of the lesion.\\n      \\n (4) Daily examination of the patient is\\n      necessary; modification of the normal structure and general reaction by\\n      the x-ray treatment sometimes appears to quickly that it is often\\n      necessary to diminish the daily dose or the size of the field in the\\n      course of treatment.\\n      \\n (5) There exists no fixed method of\\n      treatment, only a simple clinical treatment for each individual patient\\n      and for the special type of tumor..\\n      \\n (6) Improvement in roentgen apparatus\\n      of higher voltages, producing more penetrating rays, will permit a better\\n      relation between destruction of malignant cells and preservation of the\\n      supporting, and the radio sensitivity of the tumor may be prolonged.'\n",

This is the city where\\n      Homoeopathy was first introduced by Rajendra Lal Dutta of hallowed memory,\\n      who spent a princely fortune for dissemination of its principles and\\n      practice among his countrymen. This is the city where took place the\\n      dramatic conversion of one of the then medical luminaries of the first\\n      magnitude, to the practice of Homoeopathy under the influence of Rajendra\\n      Lal. I mean Dr. Mahendra Lal Sircar who became the high priest of\\n      Homoeopathy, spread its glory far and wide and gained thereby an\\n      international reputation for himself. This is the city where the\\n      celebrities of Homoeopathy like Dr. Berigny, Dr. Salzar, Dr. P.C.\\n      Majumdar, Dr. D. N. Roy. Dr. Younan, Dr. J.N. Majumdar, Dr. Baridbaran\\n      Mukherji, Dr. S.K. Nag, Dr. A.N. Mukherji, Dr. T.N. Palit, Dr. G.\\n      Dirghangi and a host of other talented physicians practised their\\n      profession with credit and success and held aloft the banner of\\n      Homoeopathy. This is the city where exist pioneer institutions for the\\n      teaching of Homoeopathy. This is the city wherefrom Homoeopathy has spread\\n      to all parts of India and its votaries are doing yeomans service for the\\n      good of the suffering humanity.\\n      \\n We are meeting this evening on a\\n      historic occasion and we have to arrive at decisions which might make or\\n      mar the future history of Homoeopathy in India. It may be that forces of\\n      disruption, destruction and obstruction are at work; it may be that self\\n      and vested interests seem to thwart the smooth progress of Homoeopathy; it\\n      may be that some may seem to play in the hands of the Powers that are not\\n      too sympathetic to the cause of Homoeopathy; it may be that the present\\n      seems to be chaotic and future of Homoeopathy dubious but great is truth\\n      indeed and will prevail. We should not lose heart or throw up the sponge.\\n      Tradition, authority, sectarianism, dogmatism are great obstacles on the\\n      way. But obstacles and difficulties are meant to be fought out and\\n      overcome. Strifes and dissensions, discords and disunities may hamper our\\n      progress but they are nonetheless signs of lifes activities. It is a good\\n      augury that the Homoeopathic profession is shaking off its age - long\\n      slumber and getting more and more conscious of its duties and obligation,\\n      its rights and privileges and of its short - comings and practical\\n      difficulties. The life of Hahnemann is there to encourage us; the\\n      masterful will of his dynamic spirit is there to inspire us to intensify\\n      our activities; his achievements are there to goad us to realise greater\\n      success; and his personality is always before us to take lessons from, in\\n      our life which as Swami Vivekananda puts it, is \"a process of\\n      unfolding and development of a being under circumstances tending to press\\n      it down.\"\\n      \\n That Homoeopathy is a scientific system\\n      of treatment, philosophically sound, logically unimpeachable, practically\\n      highly efficacious in curing the sick and cheap enough to suit the poor\\n      economic condition of the Indian masses - has become a much talked - of\\n      subject in the country. But why is it not spreading sufficiently and\\n      adequately in our motherland or in fact anywhere in the world? Why is our\\n      National Government not still keen on according official recognition to\\n      this superb system of healing art or providing ways and means for its\\n      development and diffusion? Why the public opinion is not gaining strength\\n      enough to put sufficient pressure on our Government to take interest in\\n      it? Why sufficient number of fully equipped Homoeopathic teaching\\n      institutions and hospitals are not growing to turn out adequate number of\\n      fully qualified Homoeopathic physicians in the country?\\n      \\n It is high time that we should draw the\\n      attention of the profession and the laity to provide answers to so many\\n      \"whys\" and to solve the pressing problems in the matter\\n      concerned. On a cursory view it becomes evident that the Homoeopathic\\n      profession, the people and the Government are each individually and\\n      collectively responsible for this impasse.\\n      \\n The so - called Allopathy still\\n      occupies the dominant place in any country, even in the land of birth of\\n      Homoeopathy. It is no wonder that Homoeopathy, being a discovery of merely\\n      a century and a half still lags behind its rival shool. But it is a wonder\\n      of wonders that Homoeopathy has already encompassed the whole world within\\n      such a short period since it was ushered into existence by Hahnemann.\\n      History of man reveals that nowhere a new truth was accepted by him easily\\n      and readily, obsessed as he is with conservatism, tradition, authority and\\n      vested interests. Nonetheless the triumphant march of Homoeopathy with a\\n      such a meteoric speed throughout the length and breadth of the world is a\\n      proof positive of the truth inherent in the system and phenomenal\\n      therapeutic efficacy of this healing art. It is one more glaring instance\\n      of mans love of truth against heavy odds that impede his progress at every\\n      step.\\n      \\n For the propagation of any new truth\\n      and its acceptance by man, in general, the first and foremost condition is\\n      the turning out of sufficient number of persons who have realised the\\n      truth and are adept in the practice of it. This involves establishment of\\n      a sufficient number of teaching institutions which will turn out experts\\n      in the science and art of Homoeopathy; and a sufficient number of\\n      Homoeopathic Hospital where, the efficacy of this system of treatment will\\n      be put to test.\\n      \\n Human knowledge is becoming\\n      unmanageably vast. The appearance of specialists has become indispensable.\\n      So special Hospitals for the treatment of specific types of diseases have\\n      sprung forth elsewhere, e.g. Tuberculosis Hospitals, Cancer Hospitals,\\n      Hospital for Tropical Diseases etc. Because of organisation of these\\n      hospitals people generally think of getting themselves treated in these\\n      institutions. As there are no fully - equipped general Homoeopathic\\n      Hospitals and not to speak of special Homoeopathic Hospitals and not to\\n      speak of special Homoeopathic Hospitals the result is Homoeopathy is not\\n      getting a fair chance of treating those diseases like tuberculosis,\\n      cancer, acute infectious diseases of epidemic type e.g., Small-pox,\\n      Cholera etc. on a large and organised scale. Consequently the general\\n      public cannot keep much faith in this treatment and mostly take recourse\\n      to homoeopathic treatment when the case is \"past all hope and past\\n      all surgery\". Hence the establishment of fully - equipped\\n      Homoeopathic institutions (College - cum - Hospitals) is an imperative\\n      necessity for enhancing the prestige of the Homoeopathic profession and\\n      for convincing the people about the therapeutic efficacy of this system of\\n      treatment. Is it not a pity that Homoeopathy once established its\\n      reputation by treating Cholera cases in this city and now nobody thinks of\\n      this treatment in Cholera cases and rushes the patient to the Allopathic\\n      Hospitals which are especially meant for these types of patients? How can\\n      we hope to gain ground under these circumstances?\\n      \\n The next great obstacle is the apathy\\n      and in many cases active antagonism of our Government, both at the Centre\\n      and at least in some of the State, towards Homoeopathy. The Government is\\n      under the thumb of its medical directorates which are solely manned by\\n      Allopathic doctors. The main reasons for the non - acceptance of the\\n      Homoeopathic system of treatment may be summed up in three words:\\n      tradition, authority and professionalism. Their psychology is easily\\n      understood if it is borne in mind that the conservative inertia of human\\n      mind attempts to reject any new thought will all the means at its\\n      disposal. Another reason is due to vested interests. Even a cursory glance\\n      at the history of origin and spread of Homoeopathy, enables one to find\\n      out that the opposition to this system from the start, was not scientific\\n      but rather of commercial nature on the part of the apothecaries who were\\n      afraid of losing their trade - profits. We regret to note that the Central\\n      Government have not yet implemented a single recommendation put forward by\\n      the Homoeopathic Enquiry Committee, Planning Commission. Third Health\\n      Ministers Conference, Ad Hoc Committee etc. though Homoeopathic Acts have\\n      been passed in the States of Bombay, U.P., Madhya Pradesh, Travancore -\\n      Cochin, Bihar etc. I is curious to note that W. Bengal is the only State\\n      where a Homoeopathic Bill has recently been thrown out by the State\\n      Government.\\n      \\n Another great obstacle is the\\n      psychology of the general mass of population who fail to adopt a proper\\n      philosophical attitude towards Homoeopathy and takes the Homoeopathic\\n      Therapeutic Law as great paradox contrary to common sense. Unless we can\\n      educate the public in the matter, we cannot hope to secure their whole -\\n      hearted support for this system of treatment.\\n      \\n Lack of enthusiasm for constructive\\n      works on the part of the Homoeopathic profession, the apathy of our\\n      Government and hesitancy on the part of the public to accept Homoeopathy\\n      are great obstacles to the spread of this system of treatment in the\\n      country. Unless this vicious circles is broken the progress of Homoeopathy\\n      is bound to be impeded. We have to fight on all fronts if we aspire to\\n      achieve victory in our battle for the cause of Homoeopathy and the\\n      suffering humanity.\\n      \\n But our first necessity as pointed out\\n      by the Soul of India expressing itself through Sri Aurobindo, is: If India\\n      is to survive and do her appointed work in the world, the youth of India\\n      should learn to think, to think on all subjects, to think independently,\\n      fruitfully, going to the heart of things, not stopped by their surface,\\n      free of pre - judgements, shearing sophism and prejudice asunder as with a\\n      sharp sword smiting down obscurantism of all kinds as with a mace of\\n      Bhima.\\n      \\n \"Let our brains no longer, like\\n      European infants, be swathed with swaddling clothes; let it have recover\\n      the free and unbound motion of the Gods, let it have not only the\\n      minuteness but the wide mastery and sovereignty natural to the intellect\\n      of Bharata and easily recoverable by it if it once accustomes itself to\\n      feel its own power and be convinced of its own worth.\\n      \\n \"The old fixed foundations have\\n      been broken up, we are tossing in the waters of a great upheaval and\\n      change. It is no use clinging to the old ice - floes of the past, they\\n      will soon melt and leave their refugees struggling in perilous waters. It\\n      is no use landing ourselves in the infirm bog, neither sea nor good, dry\\n      land of a second - hand Europeanism. We shall only die there a miserable\\n      and unclean death.\\n      \\n \"No we must learn to swim and use\\n      that power to reach the good vessel of unchanging truth; we must land\\n      again on the eternal rock of ages.\"\\n      \\n Yes, we must expand, we must assimilate\\n      whatever is assimilable for our growth. Stagnation and contraction are the\\n      signs of Death. Our knowledge must be aggressive, must diffuse through the\\n      rank and file of the whole Homoeopathic profession if we wish to survive\\n      and perpetuate ourselves; to leave an extensive ignorance either below or\\n      around us is to expose ourselves to the perpetual danger of being\\n      exterminated as a professional entity.\\n      \\n In fine, I welcome you, once again, on\\n      this historic occasion to this historic city to deliberate, to exchange\\n      view points and to come to agreed decisions with regard to our future line\\n      of action in respect of Homoeopathy in all its aspects.'\n",
      " 'Tresorie - SOME OBSERVATIONS ON NEURASTHENIA AND ITS TREATMENT\\n[Neurasthenia & Treatment]\\n\\n WHEN, thirty-five years ago, the writer\\n      first made the acquaintance of what is now called neurasthenia, it was\\n      known as spinal irritation, and the best of modern researches have been\\n      unable to give a better definition beyond a functional disturbance of the\\n      spinal and cerebral nerves, dependent on a morbid process, for which\\n      \"irritation\" is as proper a term as any. As deaths do not occur,\\n      autopsies throw no light on the subject. Briefly stated, neurasthenia,\\n      when observed from the beginning through its chronic course, has a period\\n      of prodromal symptoms followed by a protracted acute, and succeeded by a\\n      still more protracted chronic, state, between the end of which and the\\n      beginning of convalescence there is a very vague, often indiscernible,\\n      boundary line.\\n      \\n The prodromal symptoms are quite\\n      indefinite and very variable, pointing to nothing in particular. Loss of\\n      appetite, irregular sleep, excitability alternating with lassitude, etc.,\\n      are often overlooked, especially when the second stage-display of unusual\\n      mental and physical energy without subsequent fatigue- becomes apparent.\\n      This is often mistaken for a sign of unusually good health. When a young\\n      girl or mature woman, married or unmarried, feels that she can study ten\\n      hours a day and devote half of her night to pleasure or business; when\\n      besides much mental occupation she begins to rejoice in long walks without\\n      fatigue, that is the time when the mischief is going on without exciting\\n      timely suspicion. Relief is at last sought when the functional disorder of\\n      the nerves has gone to the opposite extreme, and becomes manifest in what\\n      is properly and popularly termed \"nervous prostration,\" when\\n      instead of having no sense of fatigue, the best bodily or mental effort\\n      seems intolerable, in grave cases rendering the patient a helpless being,\\n      completely dependent on the unremitting assistance of others whom she )it\\n      is usually a woman) rules with the inexorable power of the vis inertiae.\\n      \\n During this usually very protracted\\n      period of the disease convalescence usually sets in, but so imperceptibly\\n      that the physician alone can sometimes estimate its progress, which is\\n      unnoticeable to others towards whom the patient acts as she has for months\\n      or years. This is the time for action, too often delayed from motives of\\n      misplaced sympathy on the part of relatives and friends.\\n      \\n The affections is in many instances\\n      limited to the spine, the mind becoming only secondarily tired. In other\\n      cases it is spinal and cerebral; in others again chiefly cerebral. The\\n      line between this and insanity is always clearly definable. Though a\\n      neurasthenic patient may become insane, and probably the reverse, yet both\\n      are distinct conditions.\\n      \\n Books speak of this disease at common\\n      to men and women. Yet in this region in small towns as well as in large\\n      cities the cases of neurasthenia in women are preponderatingly great.\\n      \\n Hypochondriacs and hysteria stand in\\n      peculiar relation to neurasthenia. They maybe regarded as different\\n      species of the same genus; that is, more or less deeply seated\\n      disturbances of the cerebro-spinal system in which the sympathetic system\\n      is probably indirectly involved, as many functional disturbances presided\\n      over by the great sympathetic system often testify. Hypochondriasis, pure\\n      and simple as occurring in men, is easily distinguishable by its striking\\n      characteristic of introspection and despondency, occasioned by abnormal\\n      sensations, without marked physical weakness and tiredness. Pure\\n      hypochondriacs are often energetic, conscientious workers. In hysteria\\n      there is neither great tiredness nor tendency to introspection, but a\\n      paroxysmal or prolonged absence of the power of self control, in grave\\n      cases associated with tonic or clonic muscular spasm and loss of\\n      consciousness. While neurasthenia in its uncomplicated forms is free from\\n      these symptoms, but, as ample experience teaches, often complicated with\\n      both of the preceding forms to such an extent that it is often very\\n      difficult to tell which is primary and which secondary. The symptoms known\\n      as introspection, hysterical aberrations of the emotions, and neurasthenic\\n      sense of exhaustion are in their distinctive manifestations most important\\n      and constitute indications in the selection of remedial and dietetic\\n      measures.\\n      \\n The following are some observation of\\n      peculiarities observed in a large number of cases and peculiar to all:.\\n      \\n Introspection.-The neurasthenic patient\\n      in variably expresses her desire for relief, not so much in a direct\\n      appeal as in a supplicating, subdued tone of voice and manner. She rarely\\n      asks, \"What can you do to relieve me?\" but almost invariably,\\n      \"What is the cause of\" this or that sensation? If she is\\n      introspective, that is, hypochondriacal, she becomes a nosomaniac,\\n      watching acutely every one of her numerous distressing sensation, on the\\n      unremitting analysis of which her mind dwells. In marked cases she is\\n      quite unable to think of anything outside of herself, and in many cases\\n      dislikes to do so, preferring to river her attention on herself. Attempts\\n      to divert her annoy or anger her. Friends and relatives implore the\\n      physician to divert the patient, but all their attempts are in vain\\n      because quite misdirected.\\n      \\n Positive and Negative Will.-It seems\\n      sometimes as if the patient delights in her self-inspection, and that she\\n      prefers her condition to speedy recovery. This is not the case, for the\\n      patient will always assure the physician of her wish to get well. During\\n      the acute stage-a long yet definable period-this wish and longing cannot\\n      well be utilized, but the long and ill-defined period of convalescence\\n      must first be awaited. Here we shall always discover that the wish and the\\n      will of the patient are two very different mental conditions. The desire\\n      or wish for recovery is entirely unattended by any will effort to\\n      accomplish the desired end. The injunctions and directions of the\\n      physician are resisted by the same unconquerable power of negative power,\\n      or vis inertiae. The patient having been unable to exert her will, now\\n      thinks herself unable to use it.\\n      \\n Numerous Symptoms of Patients.-To\\n      physicians in search of indications for medicines each statement of\\n      patient concerning a sensation is apt to be considered as a symptom. Many\\n      years ago, when resolved to get at the keynote of a patient\\'s case, the\\n      writer determined to allow the patient to detail all her symptoms as long\\n      as she chose and to take accurate notes of each one till the right one\\n      should be disclosed; and this was to be done regardless of time and\\n      exertion. The patient, one who needed no urging to describe her\\n      \"symptoms,\" began in an almost inaudible voice, detailing one\\n      sensation after another with an unrivalled degree of clearness and\\n      vividness of expression; as she proceeded the voice became stronger, her\\n      face slightly flushed, and the most perfect descriptive language flowed in\\n      an endless stream. Each word was written down, page after page was filled;\\n      still she went on with unmistakable signs of satisfaction at being able to\\n      pour her pent-up emotions into willing and sympathetic ears. If, for a\\n      moment, the flow of language was interrupted, a simple question would\\n      re-animate her to proceed with renewed energy. Feelings seemed to beget\\n      feelings; their complexity gave the patient no trouble; her intellect was\\n      equal to the action of unraveling the most complicated sensation,\\n      separating them into their component parts and spreading them out before\\n      the mind of the listener. A glance at the watch showed that nearly two\\n      hours had passed, during which the feeblest of neurasthenic patients had\\n      talked incessantly. The note-book was full, the keynote was found. It was\\n      this: neurasthenic patients have innumerable sensation and exhibit no\\n      sings of fatigue after talking incessantly for nearly two hours.\\n      \\n Great Endurance of Neurasthenics.-The\\n      instance just related, which is one of many, illustrates two things. One\\n      is, that it is not the kind of sensation described but the fact that\\n      neurasthenics have innumerable sensations, that constitute the symptoms.\\n      The other thing is that many neurasthenics are capable of great exertion\\n      without suffering disagreeable after- effects from fatigue. This is\\n      illustrated by other cases of which I have notes. A highly neurasthenic\\n      young lady consented to camp out for her health near a lake. She was\\n      induced to join a party for a short walk along the lake. By trying what\\n      they thought a shorter road the party lost their way and took a very long\\n      walk of about four hours, through bogs and over forces. The neurasthenic\\n      was less fatigued than some of the others. The interesting observation was\\n      subsequently made that the patient had become interested in a young man of\\n      the party. She recovered her health within a year from that time. Other\\n      cases of this kind will appear under the head of therapeutic suggestions.\\n      \\n Neurasthenic Patients Crave\\n      Sympathy.-This is one of the most formidable obstacles to the curative\\n      management of such cases, for the kind of sympathy such patients crave is\\n      expressions of condolence and more or less deep affliction at so much\\n      suffering as the patient expresses. Such sympathy is most natural and does\\n      honor to the feelings of parents, sisters, brothers and husbands, but it\\n      is unfortunate that the deeper their expression of affliction so much the\\n      more profound will be the mental dejection and weakness of the patient.\\n      Almost every case which has come under the writer\\'s observation has been\\n      much hampered if not made hopeless by this condition of things, against\\n      which no remedy suggests itself that would not be construed as\\n      \"unkind\".\\n      \\n The origin of this very formidable and\\n      refractory nervous disease, like that of most diseases usually termed\\n      chronic, is either hereditary or acquired, as the histories of every\\n      observed case plainly testify. Either the father was a hypochondriac or\\n      the mother neurasthenic, or both parents were of unsound nervous\\n      constitution. Dipsomania on the part of parents produces neurasthenia in\\n      the children, as readily as it will be followed by any other form of\\n      nervous disease, according to the individual predisposition of the\\n      offspring. The excessive use of tea and coffee is another very active\\n      factor in the history of neurasthenics. Where fathers inclined to alcohol,\\n      mothers are addicted to tea and coffee, which, while its immediate effects\\n      do not obtrude themselves upon our notice, are none the less insidious in\\n      their more remote consequences.\\n      \\n The acquired forms of neurasthenia are\\n      of utmost interest to the therapeutist, and the sources of acquisition are\\n      readily stated. They are much brain-work with insufficient food and sleep.\\n      Such conditions obtain chiefly in women (less frequently in men) of fine\\n      intellectual ability, conscientiousness and ambition. Physical overwork\\n      with unintellectual women has no such effect. Quite analogous to the above\\n      are the conditions of care and sorrow, especially in women who are able\\n      for a long time to conceal and control their emotions. The usual\\n      consequence of such states of mind is disregard of food and insufficient\\n      sleep. Instances of acquired neurasthenia are presented in families of\\n      several girls and boys, where one or more of the former are Neurasthenic\\n      while the latter are vigorous and athletic. Boys delighting in vigorous\\n      exercise do not, as is the case with girls, lose appetite and sleep.\\n      \\n The effects of nervous exhaustion in\\n      boys are usually much less grave than in girls; as a rule such effects are\\n      manifested in mental, not muscular, tiredness, and they are relieved by\\n      air and exercise, while in girls and women those influences are shunned\\n      because they seem to increase the tiredness.\\n      \\n Predisposition-The temperament, or what\\n      in modern pharaseology is called the personal equation, plays a visible\\n      but uncontrollable part in the progress of neurasthenia, as temperament\\n      greatly determines the other imperfectly known condition known as\\n      predisposition. Where the disease is hereditary, it is easy to say that\\n      the predisposition is due to that source; where there is no history of\\n      heredity and where neurasthenia exists in the last members of a\\n      generation, it may be attributed to acquired predisposition which needed\\n      only the exciting cause to establish the disease in its most typical form.\\n      \\n One of the most common forms of\\n      neurasthenia, often quite intractable, results from a serious defect in\\n      our public school system, one which affects chiefly girls from twelve to\\n      fourteen years of age. The following is a brief example: The child rises\\n      late with no appetite for breakfast and no time to eat it if so inclined.\\n      The lessons, however, have been learned the evening before, and the school\\n      work is begun with an ambitions will and a crammed mind, and continues\\n      with one intermission of often not more than ten minutes or three of four\\n      hours. The pupil arrives at home ravenously hungry, eats too fast, and too\\n      much of injudiciously prepared food, too long in digesting to leave room\\n      for an appetite for even a light evening meal, or even for a breakfast the\\n      next morning.\\n      \\n In another case the girl or boy grows\\n      desperately hungry while at school, but being unprovided with food\\n      (lunch), goes on with the school exercises, at the end of which the sense\\n      of hunger has vanished and has been replaced by an aversion to normal\\n      food, with a possible craving for something pungent and indigestible. This\\n      observation can easily be made in many instances, and will, in as many\\n      cases, be seen to lead to nervous prostration, which is then treated by\\n      vile, patented concoctions consisting largely of whiskey, under the name\\n      of \"tonics,\" while the patient needs only the best that a\\n      legitimate market affords prepared in a sensible manner.\\n      \\n Typical Cases Ending in Rapid\\n      Recovery.-Curative results have already been indicated in what has been\\n      said above, and further indications for treatment may be gathered from a\\n      few cases of extremely rapid recovery of apparently incurable cases, to\\n      which brief allusion will here be made. A woman of forty had been a victim\\n      of grave neurasthenia for five years. In the absence of an inclination to\\n      exert himself, she had, during that period, been mostly confined to her\\n      bed or lounge, in the meantime giving birth to two children, going through\\n      gestation and confinement normally, without recovering from neurasthenic\\n      prostration which, in the course of some years more, rendered her entirely\\n      helpless. Her condition was associated with a feeling of dropping to\\n      pieces unless supported and braced by a harness of wood, iron and leather,\\n      in which she \"sat up\" for several hours each day, spending the\\n      rest of the time in bed. Having left the patient in this condition, it was\\n      reported before the writer\\'s next professional visit that Mrs.-had been\\n      cured, and that she was able to go out like other people. A visit to the\\n      house confirmed the report. The patient came to the door herself, and in a\\n      quiet manner, entirely without the least expression of joy or wonder at\\n      her release, stated, that having heard of a famous \"magnetic\\n      physician,\" she summoned him, was ordered by him to arise and stand;\\n      protesting that it was impossible, she was raised to her feet and again\\n      ordered to stand, then to walk. Fearing that she would fall, she begged\\n      the magnetic doctor to support her, which he peremptorily refused, saying\\n      she might fall if she liked. Instead of falling, she had to walk about the\\n      room, was then placed upon a lounge and subjected to a severe treatment of\\n      rolling and pummelling, and then ordered to dress and sit up until tired,\\n      to remain up and about like other people, and to call on the doctor in\\n      future, as he would not come so far to the patient again. This happened\\n      about twenty-five years ago, and the patient has been in very fair health\\n      arrested by insisting that all professional visits by the writer or any\\n      other physician to whose sympathy the patient could appeal must cease.\\n      This injunction was carried out conscientiously with the best results by\\n      the husband of the patient. Perhaps we may learn from this that sometimes,\\n      at least, the familiar motto is reversed, and angels rush in where fools\\n      fear to tread.\\n      \\n Profiting by this experience, another\\n      neurasthenic woman, unmarried, but of most intractable, antagonistic\\n      temperament, confined to her bed, in and out of hospitals, for years,\\n      wearing out the strength and means of her relatives and the patience of\\n      many physicians, was at length abandoned by them. It was a case of spinal\\n      and cerebral neurasthenia complicated with hypochondriasis in its most\\n      trying form of introspective maunderings and endless description of\\n      symptoms. She tormented her advisers by her endless tirades, the\\n      indulgence of which invariably aggravated her condition, and were there\\n      fore avoided, until once her physician yielded to the patient\\'s\\n      importunities for a visit, when be found her in her usual abject state of\\n      prostration. Guided by experience derived from cases like the one first\\n      described, he assisted the patient to her feet and marched her, will you\\n      nil you, up and down the room until he, at least, was thoroughly tired,\\n      and then departed with the promise never to do so again. The patient, on\\n      her part, made a number of her unnameable promises, but kept on her feet\\n      and let the doctors alone. Though not cured of deeply-rooted morbid mental\\n      faults, the neurasthenic phase of her condition had yielded to the change\\n      of the antagonistic element of her character from passive to very\\n      practical activity. A third very serious case of this kind occurred in the\\n      person of a girl of fifteen, of selfish character, who gradually became\\n      bed-ridden with spinal and cerebral neurasthenia, and tormented with the\\n      usual multifarious painful sensations, none of which, on the most\\n      pains-taking physical examination, resulted from demonstrable organic\\n      disease of genital or abdominal organs. The patient was most tenderly\\n      cared for by her mother, who, in the course of years, became so imbued\\n      with the idea of yielding to every wish and whim of the patient, that at\\n      length remonstrance became useless. The mother, though recognizing the\\n      importance of persuading or urging her daughter to depend more on herself,\\n      admitted that she had yielded so long that now she must continue to feed,\\n      dress and assist her charge in the most trivial things. Her food had to be\\n      placed in her mouth, the position of a hand or foot changed by some one\\n      else, although patient did so spontaneously when she chose. This went on\\n      for fifteen years, when the mother, growing old and feeble, died. Her\\n      maternal support being gone, the patient at once proved her ability to\\n      walk, to dress, to feed herself, and to seek light employment. Though far\\n      from well, she is equally far fro being a helpless, bed-ridden invalid.\\n      \\n A fourth case, still very vividly\\n      impressed on the writer\\'s mind, was one of a healthy, romping girl of 14,\\n      who, as happen in this remarkably capricious disease, in the midst of\\n      perfect health, one day took to her bed and remained there with all the\\n      symptoms of neurasthenia, involving first the spinal and finally the\\n      cerebral nerves. This patient was very amiable, conscientious, and\\n      sensible, never loquacious, and not troubled with hypochondriacal thoughts\\n      or sensations. Tiredness was the only expression she used in describing\\n      her feelings. There was literally no variation from this condition, which\\n      confined her to her bed for years, till she grew from a girl to a woman.\\n      Eating and sleeping well, and improving perceptibly in personal appearance\\n      and character, yet she lay on her couch tired and watched over with\\n      unremitting care by a most anxious mother, showing her solicitude and\\n      sympathy in every feature. Once, in the second year of the disease, a\\n      favorable interruption occurred. The mother, still a young woman, gave\\n      birth to another child. During her confinement the neurasthenic patient\\n      was in charge of her mother\\'s nurse, assisted by other servants. The\\n      nurse, while devoted to the daughter, agreed with the writer that excess\\n      of sympathy was injurious, and used her best and judicious endeavors\\n      gradually to persuade the patient to make some physical effort at walking\\n      and standing. In this she was so successful that in two weeks she\\n      accompanied the girl on half-mile walks up and down hill, finally without\\n      assistance. Thus, recovery seemed assured, and everything was favorable\\n      progressing towards it when the mother, having fully recovered, again took\\n      charge of her daughter, with the result that she at once took to her\\n      lounge and remained there two years longer. About that time other advice\\n      was urged and gladly acceded to, with the result that the case was\\n      diagnosed by an eminent surgeon as spinal paralysis in consequence of\\n      concussion, though it could never be shown when and where it occurred.\\n      Salves, plasters, anodynes, nervines, and electricity did no good, but\\n      effectually destroyed appetite and digestion, which higher to had been\\n      normal. So this adviser resigned in favor of a third, who, being a younger\\n      and less prejudiced man, agreed perfectly with the writer\\'s original\\n      opinion. He advised return to moderate exercise, avoidance of drugs, and\\n      less display of sympathy. This, though formerly rejected as\\n      \"unkind,\" was now acceded to as coming from a nerve- specialist,\\n      fresh from Europe, at that time very rare. Still attending the other\\n      members of the family, the writer had sample opportunity of observing the\\n      course of the case. Improvement was very slow and uncertain till financial\\n      misfortune overtook the family. Almost with a bound our patient left her\\n      cough, and, organizing a kindergarten, strove energetically in supporting\\n      herself and assisting her mother. The change came about in less than three\\n      weeks, and resulted in perfect recovery.\\n      \\n At this point another very instructive\\n      case of very speedy recovery, after six or seven years of neurasthenic\\n      prostration, deserves to be mentioned. A woman of 35 had been in bed and\\n      on the lounge most of the time for nearly seven years, at the end of which\\n      time she became my patient, her regular medical attendant having gone to\\n      Europe. She was of very amiable disposition and as sensitive as she was\\n      weak. Her symptoms, as in the other cases, were instantaneous exhaustion\\n      on the least physical exertion. She could give herself up to no mental\\n      occupation beyond directing her house-hold affairs, the education of her\\n      son, and the rehearsal of her numerous sensations. She had not been my\\n      patient long when her husband failed in business, so that the family was\\n      reduced from very comfortable circumstances to a condition which made it\\n      necessary for the patient to make her own living and that of the family.\\n      This she almost at once proceeded to do, setting aside all other\\n      considerations and establishing a boarding-house, where she did most of\\n      the work herself. This she has done now for ten or twelve years without a\\n      serious relapse. The time involved in the period of convalescence was\\n      scarcely more than three weeks, a although her work maybe said to have\\n      begun at the moment her resolution was taken.\\n      \\n Prognostics.-From these and other cases\\n      in and outside of the writer\\'s practice, it is safe to say that the\\n      majority of cases of neurasthenia recover, though years may elapse before\\n      that period. We learn, furthermore, that recoveries, especially of very\\n      inveterate cases, depend on conditions beyond the control of the\\n      physician, as was the case in the above-recorded instances, where\\n      circumstances forced the patient to cases to wish for recovery and to make\\n      an effort of the will. This having been once accomplished self-confidence,\\n      for a long time in abeyance, was permanently restored.\\n      \\n Curability, further, depends very much\\n      on the temperament of the patient, whether amiable, tractable and\\n      confiding in the honest endeavors of the physician, or whether refractory,\\n      suspicious, untruthful, selfish and antagonistic, of a disposition\\n      impossible to win over on account of unnatural distrust of every\\n      well-meaning person. The degree of intelligence of patients also has a\\n      pronounced influence on the result. The most readily curable cases are\\n      those acquired without hereditary predisposition, where the cause is found\\n      in the absence of food and sleep, also where sorrow and anxiety can be\\n      averted or counteracted by judicious conduct of near relatives and\\n      friends.\\n      \\n Dietetic Treatment.-This, as medicinal\\n      treatment, must be governed by the stage at which the case comes into the\\n      physician\\'s hands-whether yet in its prodromal, its acute or its chronic\\n      phase. The prodromal stage of the disease has no very decided\\n      pathognomonic signs. The most that can be recognized in this stage is that\\n      the patient\\'s habits or duties are of a kind which will eventually lead to\\n      obdurate neurasthenia if not arrested in time by removing the exciting\\n      causes. Too much pleasure, as well as too much care, especially in girls\\n      and woman, tends to neglect of food and rest, in the absence of which,\\n      excitements, whether of pleasure or care, begets a state of unrest in\\n      which repose is disagreeable. With such a condition comes a list of\\n      incipient casual complaints of headache, imperfect sleep, notional ways of\\n      eating, working or playing. A few questions will determine whether the\\n      patient is living according to normal or abnormal habits with regard to\\n      appetite, sleep and occupation. Where these are found, their alteration to\\n      normal ways must be instead on. It is unnecessary to say that this is\\n      easier said than done, for it will probably meet with serious objections\\n      on the part of the patient, if not on that of her relatives; for most\\n      likely she has examinations for college to prepare for, involving several\\n      months of dose and careful study at night, and the patient cannot waste\\n      time in sleeping and eating while cramming that little excited and\\n      ambitions brain. A failure in the examinations would be as much of a\\n      disappointment to parents as to patient, who proves, as usual, that this\\n      appellation is a misnomer. She accordingly goes in as she please, lied by\\n      an increasing morbidly ambitions impulse, and the result is likely to be\\n      the mournful satisfaction on the part of the physician of being obliged to\\n      say, \"I told you before what would happen.\" Of course, all\\n      regret the now evident nerve-prostration, while, if the doctor had\\n      succeeded in enforcing his rules, he would in many cases experience the\\n      still more painful reproach of having been too severe. Nevertheless,\\n      absolute firmness and a kindly but unflinching exertion of his will,\\n      without the least compromise, reward the physician with the best results\\n      in such cases.\\n      \\n When the case, after the stage of\\n      excitement and untiring restlessness (at which it would still be speedily\\n      curable by simple dietetic rules) has, after weeks or months, entered upon\\n      the phase of painful prostration, here we encounter backache, oppressive\\n      headache, and absolute loss of mental or bodily endurance, measures of\\n      dietetic management are much less effective and much more difficult to\\n      find. it is at this stage that slight rise of temperature will occur,\\n      especially towards evening; then the backache and headache disappear, the\\n      pallor is replaced by a flush of color, the eyes lose their listless look,\\n      and the patient is inclined to enter upon some diversion or excitement,\\n      followed by a restless night and a morning of exhaustion and a renewal of\\n      all painful sensations. Most of such patients feel much better in the\\n      evening when they are ready for some entertainment, while in a normal\\n      state this would be the time for relaxation and repose.\\n      \\n The dietetic treatment of this stage is\\n      methodical rest. In severe cases the patient will do well to remain in bed\\n      for several days or even for weeks. It is well to shorten this period as\\n      much as possible and to insist on walking about, or, at least. sitting for\\n      a specified time every day. This may be varied b equally specified periods\\n      of rest in the recumbent position.\\n      \\n Irregularities of eating are at this\\n      and at all times to be superseded by the most rigid regularity of meals.\\n      The traditional and conventional three-meal system, however well adapted\\n      to the needs of a vigorous man or woman, does not agree with the\\n      neurasthenic patient. It is much better that these should eat oftener;\\n      four times a day is best in most cases, for the simple reason that in this\\n      way a patient, while eating less at a time, consumes more food in the\\n      aggregate.\\n      \\n As neurasthenic patients are rarely\\n      troubled with absolute aversion to wholesome food, they are generally able\\n      to consume a liberal quantity, about which it is only needful to remark\\n      here that the food should be selected from among the articles and dishes\\n      which the patient likes, provided they belong to the order of good, normal\\n      articles of food, to the exclusion of those which simply please the taste\\n      without being digestible. A dish entirely of meat or \"animal\\n      food\" is as far from being a good diet for neurasthenics as one\\n      consisting entirely of \"vegetable\" food. As a rule, the diet\\n      list should comprise one-third of nitrogenous material and two-thirds of\\n      carbohydrates. Together with these, it is a great mistake to neglect the\\n      fats, such as good butter and the fats of meats. And, lastly, every\\n      patient of this kind should be made to drink some water often, a dietetic\\n      feature too often neglected.\\n      \\n During this stage, actually fatiguing\\n      exercise of body and mind should be avoided, while, on the other hand, the\\n      patient\\'s mind should be directed away from herself, in which she is much\\n      assisted by withholding a certain kind of emotional sympathy, quite as\\n      natural as it is difficult to repress on the part of affectionate persons.\\n      Of this, a few words further on.\\n      \\n There is no definite time for the\\n      duration of this stage, which, however, depends largely on the time during\\n      which the exciting causes have acted, either aided by or without a\\n      predisposition. It is certain, however, that the sooner it is recognized\\n      and the exciting causes eliminated, so much the sooner recovery will\\n      begin. But there is a stage at which the best of experience and judgment\\n      often fail, especially in very inveterate cases. If the case is one of a\\n      patient whom the physician has had opportunity of watching at least since\\n      the earlier stages, the difficulty is not so great as it is in old cases\\n      months or even of several years\\' duration which come to treatment late. In\\n      these, the line between the intermediate stage and incipient convalescence\\n      cannot be drawn. The patient is as neurasthenic and hypochondriacal as\\n      ever; cannot bear the slightest mental or bodily exertion, not even a word\\n      or a look, without sings of apparent exhaustion, while nearly the whole\\n      time is spent in bed under anxious care of sympathetic attendants. In such\\n      cases, having become assured, by careful physical examination, of the\\n      absence of organic disease, seeing the patient generally well nourished\\n      and in fair muscular condition, the physician is warranted in assuming\\n      that the disease has run its course, that whatever morbid (pathological)\\n      process there may have been progressing in the nervous system, this\\n      process has now come to and end, but it has left the patient\\'s mental\\n      condition habituated to the moods of the past months or years, and fixed,\\n      as it were, indelibly in the memory. It is the habit that now remains, not\\n      the disease.\\n      \\n If reasonably sure of this, and calling\\n      to mind the rapid recoveries and the circumstances attending them, as\\n      above detailed, the physician is now safe in ordering a more energetic\\n      treatment, calculated to rouse the self-reliance of the patient. All\\n      visible signs of sympathy must now be set aside; the actins and demeanor\\n      of the attendants should, from this time, if not before, be changed so as\\n      to give the patient the impression that she is no longer an invalid, but\\n      expected to rely on her own exertion. Instead of being fed, the food\\n      should be placed where she must go for and eat it. She should now be\\n      expected to dress and attend, without assistance, to her natural wants.\\n      This, with some temperaments, is almost impossible, with al extremely\\n      difficult. The best course to pursue is to remove such patients from\\n      sympathetic relatives or friends, and to place them in charge of kind,\\n      reliable, but eminently practical nurses.\\n      \\n The first effect of this is either to\\n      throw the patient into a stage of helpless despondency, which, again\\n      appealing powerfully to the sympathies of those nearest to her, often\\n      frustrates the physician\\'s plans which, if firmly but kindly adhered to,\\n      would, ere long, prove of their superiority by signs of returning\\n      self-reliance and absence of complaints on the part of the patient. A\\n      second form of effect is that occurring in patients of obstreperous,\\n      selfish disposition, whose opposition and even anger is aroused by being\\n      thrown on their own resources after the removal of depressing and\\n      unpractical sympathy. This opposition or temper, often manifested in all\\n      sorts of intrigues and subterfuges on the part of the patient, if not\\n      supinely yielded to by sympathetic persons, will finally be replaced by a\\n      more rational disposition. On the whole, anger or active opposition are\\n      signs of returning energy, which, once coming to the consciousness of the\\n      patient, takes the form of self- reliance. it is this way that the cures\\n      of chronic cases above related can be explained, and physicians should\\n      profit by such experience for the benefit of their patients.\\n      \\n The general dietetic management now\\n      readily follows from what has been said, and needs only a few general\\n      modifications. The first duty of the physician will be to test the degree\\n      of reliance to be placed on the patient and her friends, ad to win them\\n      over if possible to his plans, and his success will be in proportion to\\n      the degree of confidence he is able to inspire. This personal confidence\\n      should not degenerate into a mere personal liking or attachment of a\\n      sympathy-craving neurasthenic who should discover henceforth that all\\n      sentimental expressing of sympathy are about to take a practical form,\\n      aiming at a definite result-the patient\\'s health-which she wishes but\\n      cannot exert her will to attain. The best and often the only way to do\\n      away with sentiment and to reach practical kindness is to remove the\\n      patient from certain home influence, and to place her in a hospital or\\n      elsewhere under the management of competent nurses who, without being\\n      selfish, know how to exert a certain amount of wholesome push as fast as\\n      the patient can bear it. Without the removal of sentimental sympathy, all\\n      efforts at counteracting the purely hypochondriacal side of neurasthenia\\n      are useless.\\n      \\n In these cases of neurasthenia as yet\\n      uncomplicated with the hypochondriacal element of introspective nosomania,\\n      there is only one unconditional rule to be followed, especially in\\n      acquired cases whose evident cause was incessant, conscientious work of\\n      mind and body, together with insufficient food and sleep. Such cases come\\n      on very insidiously, the loss of strength-that is, the actual waste of\\n      nerve-substance-being just a trifle grater than the quantity restored, the\\n      patient unconsciously using up a minute part of her capital every day.\\n      Here the rule should be to reverse matters to insuring a supply of\\n      nourishment and time for its assimilation greater than was the case\\n      heretofore. The case of young school-girls belong in this class. The time\\n      of food and rest should be carefully controlled at home, the duty of the\\n      physician being to educate indifferent and ignorant parents up to an\\n      appreciation of the nature of the case. It is generally not difficult to\\n      open their eyes through the medium of their anxiety concerning their\\n      children\\'s health. Having thus insured sufficient rest and food at home,\\n      the physician\\'s next object of attention should be the regulations of the\\n      school. Here is the point where teachers have an opportunity of exerting\\n      their most practical influence. It should be made obligatory on the part\\n      of teachers to institute inquiry as to whether pupils have had their meals\\n      before coming to school. This they could often ascertain without a\\n      question, by reading the pupil\\'s condition in her emaciated form, pale\\n      face and nervous manner. To guard against neglect at home, it would be an\\n      easy matter to insist that all pupils of public and private schools should\\n      bring with them some proper food. The few who do so generally bring\\n      sweets-an apple, orange or a few dry crackers-when a piece of good bread\\n      and slice of cold meat would be what they actually need. All pupils should\\n      pass inspection, and if remiss in this important particular, the\\n      delinquent should be dismissed with several marks against her. To expect\\n      this of teachers would be a great advance in the place of futile\\n      innovations of endeavoring to send forth from our common schools graduates\\n      in arts and sciences.\\n      \\n Sudden Effects.-A large number of cases\\n      of neurasthenia, especially those complicated with inveterate\\n      Hypochondriasis, are frequently traced to some sudden occurrence, having\\n      the effect of a mental or physical shock. In one patient, a vigorous girl,\\n      used to romping, climbing and running lie a boy, the cause was supposed to\\n      be a slight thump she received during a game of blindman\\'s-buff. She\\n      thought nothing of it at the time, but it was suggested long after the\\n      patient\\'s illness began. In another case some mental shock of joy or\\n      grief, not very severe and such as is often experienced in every person\\'s\\n      life, is the beginning of months of nervous prostration.\\n      \\n There is quite an array of evidence\\n      that neurasthenia which has entered upon a hypochondriacal stage or\\n      complication with or without a strong hysterical admixture, is curable by\\n      sudden impressions in the form of a shock, or more gradually by frequent\\n      repetitions of an impression. Such cases, as I have shown above, occur\\n      most commonly in the stage when what may be considered the essential\\n      pathological disturbances of function have run their course and have left\\n      the patient in a state of mental disturbance which indicated that the\\n      patient\\'s recovery depends entirely upon her volition. But there is none,\\n      and so far nothing has succeeded in arousing it. Persuasion is as useless\\n      and irritating, as argument would be in a case of insanity with a fixed\\n      illusion. The resemblance between this and the state of mind of a\\n      hypochondriacal neurasthenic is very close. She cannot move nor thick.\\n      Exhaustion overcomes her and keeps her its victim for years, when suddenly\\n      the scene changes, and a few days or weeks suffice to restore the patient\\n      to activity. In one instance it is attributed to medical, in another to\\n      \"mind cure,\" in a third to \"Christian science;\" in\\n      still other cases massage has done it, in others again \"magnetic\\n      influence,\" in others the very powerful factor necessity. It is\\n      certain that cases of this kind, produced by sudden effects on the mind of\\n      a predisposed person, are also cured by such effects. Whatever the visible\\n      form of these effects may be -whether that of \"Christian\\n      science,\" joy, grief or absolute inexorable necessity, there is\\n      always to be noticed a certain force and condition involving the modern\\n      idea of suggestion, which comes to the patient in an irresistible degree\\n      and now sets the function of the will in motion again.\\n      \\n Experience teaches that it is by no\\n      means a matter of indifference which of these forms of effect are brought\\n      into action. In one case it is the professional Christian scientist\\'s\\n      method, in another the almost brutal exertion of a person\\'s will combined\\n      with some physical force. In either case the patient is aroused from his\\n      inertia, and discovers his powers of mental and bodily ability to act.\\n      \\n A deplorable result is that recoveries\\n      after such effects are attributed in the popular mind to supernatural\\n      causes. That such is not the case may be gathered form instances occurring\\n      in very sensible and intelligent patients, whose reason is scarcely ever\\n      so far disturbed and weakened that they do not resent the proposition of\\n      trying, e.g., Christian science or mind cure.\\n      \\n Nevertheless, it is the mind cure which\\n      the intelligent patient needs quite as much as the ignorant and\\n      superstitious person; the difference is only the form in which the\\n      influencing force is applied. While in one case it is obedience to the\\n      candidly expressed instructions of the physician, in the other case the\\n      result is the to mystification. In either case it is the powerful stimulus\\n      of hope and aroused confidence that recovery will be realized.\\n      \\n The definition of suggestion does not\\n      fully cover the meaning, because the influence employed is greater than\\n      mere suggestion. The physician\\'s plan of action should be straightforward\\n      assurance of recovery, a direct appeal to hope, and an unceasing endeavor\\n      to arouse the self-reliance of the patient, not so much by verbal\\n      exhortations as by a manner and department from which the patient learns\\n      more readily than from words what is expected. If the attitude of the\\n      physician is appreciated, and seconded by the relatives and attendants, a\\n      favorable result is much more certain to follow.\\n      \\n Hypnotism is not advisable. There are\\n      now existing ancient neurasthenic invalids dating from the times of\\n      spiritualism when they were famous \"mediums.\" Hypnotism weakness\\n      the will and nervous endurance, and produces a predisposition to emotional\\n      nervousness with an intractable erotic admixture. The suggestions sought\\n      to be instilled into a hypnotized patient amount to nothing. The mental\\n      influence of mystical treatment administered while the patients is awake\\n      is much more powerful in awaking hope and confidence than the uncertain\\n      effects of an abnormal state like that of hypnotism. Mystification, again,\\n      though sometimes unavoidable with the best intention, is less powerful\\n      than direct and intelligible encouragement. While resort to mystification\\n      should be shunned by reputable physicians, the question arises as to what\\n      shall be done with the many who, from lack of intelligence or education,\\n      are entirely beyond the reach of honest common sense, and who will persist\\n      in mystifying themselves, who remain neurasthenic invalids in spite of the\\n      best regulations of the physician, and who do not recover unless their\\n      encouragement follows some mystical formalities which alone arouse their\\n      \"faith\" and finally their confidence and will-power. For the\\n      present there is no way out of the dilemma but to submit such patients to\\n      the suggestive methods of what is popularly known as mind cure and\\n      Christian science. In doing so, physicians should use their influence as\\n      far as possible in selecting the most honest persons of this class.\\n      \\n DISCUSSION.\\n      \\n JAMES C. WOOD, M.D.: I have nothing but\\n      words of praise for Dr. Wesselhoeft\\'s excellent paper. It is very evident\\n      that the author\\'s inspiration came not from books but from actual contact\\n      with neurasthenic subjects, for the impress of originality is most\\n      conspicuous. It is a production which could only come from one of\\n      experience and from a reasoner. I consider it a most valuable contribution\\n      to the literature of that now most interesting subject,\\n      \"neurasthenia\".\\n      \\n The doctor, in his paper, has sometimes\\n      used the term \"neurasthenia\" instead of\\n      \"neurasthenia.\" The first of these means, according to Thomas,\\n      great nervous power or excitement; the second, nervous debility. I taken\\n      it from the context that the subject dealt with is neurasthenia. To the\\n      average mind there exists what seems to me a needless confusion regarding\\n      the terms, nervous prostration, hysteria and hystero-neurosis. As I\\n      understand these terms they define distinct conditions, though there is a\\n      frequent blending the one with the other. The term nervous prostration,\\n      which is a synonym of neurasthenia, defines itself; the term hysteria\\n      should be restricted to those general neuroses characterized particularly\\n      by psychical manifestations, though not infrequently by motor, sensory,\\n      secretory, vasomotor and reflex derangements as well; while the term\\n      hysteroneurosis implies the uterine origin of symptoms manifesting\\n      themselves in organs remote from the uterus without structural changes in\\n      such organs, being the direct result of reflex nervous influence starting\\n      from the uterus. The last term does not occur in the paper under\\n      discussion. From the standpoint of a gynecologist I think that this is\\n      misleading.\\n      \\n Let us see why and how it is that these\\n      three conditions (I will not call them diseases) are so frequently\\n      associated. I think that all will admit the frequent occurrence in woman\\n      of reflex symptoms, the result of pelvic lesions. An irritation staring\\n      form the pelvis is conveyed to the genito-spinal centre, thence to any or\\n      all organs with which this centre communicates. The organ oftener involved\\n      than any other is the stomach. This is shown by the frequent occurrence of\\n      nausea and vomiting following conception. The nervous system may have been\\n      previously involved, but oftener it becomes so only after the nutrition is\\n      depraved, which, sooner or later, occurs if the pelvic lesion is not\\n      removed. The depraved blood fails to supply the nerve centres with that\\n      which they need to sustain them, and they become anaemic. Prostration is\\n      but a subjective manifestation of the anaemia, and it varies in degree\\n      from a slight indisposition to the most abject helplessness.\\n      \\n If, then, nervous prostration may have\\n      its beginning in a pelvic lesion, is it possible for a pelvic lesion to be\\n      inaugurated by systemic disturbances? Personally, I believe that it is,\\n      and offer this explanation as the modus operandi by which such a lesion is\\n      induced: Marked circulatory changes nearly always attend nervous\\n      prostration. The circulation is presided over by the vaso-motor system,\\n      and wear and repair depend upon the proper regulation of this system. If\\n      it becomes disturbed, the bloodvessels dilate or contract unduly, with\\n      resulting local hyperaemia or local anaemia, as the case maybe. The\\n      climacteric flushes are the result of such disturbance. The alternate\\n      coldness and heat of the extremities, so often associated with rectal and\\n      uterine lesions, is another familiar illustration. If the brain is\\n      involved, either insomnia or drowsiness occur, depending upon whether the\\n      brain is anaemic or hyperaemic. Flatulence, gastralgia, and nervous\\n      dyspepsia result when the stomach is similarly affected. The womb and the\\n      ovaries, because of the periodical congestion imposed upon them, are\\n      oftener implicated by these unnatural circulatory disturbances than any of\\n      the pelvic organs, and in time also become unduly hyperaemic or anaemic,\\n      as the case may be.\\n      \\n It will thus be seen that nervous\\n      prostration may exist independently of pelvic lesions, or, conversely,\\n      pelvic lesions may exist independently of nervous prostration.\\n      Nevertheless, the two are frequently associated, and this fact ought, I\\n      believe, to be kept in mind in dealing with the affection known as\\n      neurasthenia. Hysterical manifestations nearly always come to the surface\\n      in nervous prostration, and they also frequently attend pelvic lesions.\\n      Indeed, the term \"hystero-psychosis\" has been coined for the\\n      purpose of defining certain psychical disturbances of presumably pelvic\\n      origin, and in the broadest sense neurasthenia is not uncommonly an\\n      hysteroneurosis. It is the frequent association of these three conditions\\n      which, it seems to me, makes it more practicable to study them conjointly.\\n      \\n The special symptoms of nervous\\n      prostration are most variable. Introspection, as Dr. Wesselhoeft has\\n      pointed out, makes of the patient a nosomaniac. The anaemic nerve centres\\n      are unduly impressionable, and a mental shock which would not seriously\\n      affect a stronger and more rugged woman falls with crushing force upon one\\n      whose nutrition is already depraved. In this way are developed disorders\\n      of sensibility, alternations of mobility, circulatory disturbances,\\n      anomalies of secretion and exertion, disorders of the gastro-intestinal\\n      canal, dermatoses, and general and psychical disturbances of all kinds.\\n      Many of these affections start from pelvic lesions, and are nearly always\\n      associated with depravity of nutrition and more or less nervous\\n      prostration.\\n      \\n Some of the worst symptoms of\\n      neurasthenia with which I have had to contend have been hyperaesthesia of\\n      the articulations, giving rise to the so-called \"hysterical\\n      joint.\" Here the prostration is usually not profound, and it is\\n      possible to apply the somewhat energetic treatment recommended by Dr.\\n      Wesselhoeft. I remember one case very distinctly, the detailed history of\\n      which I shall give in another place, which brought me much reputation\\n      because of the \"remarkable\" cure I was fortunate enough to make.\\n      \\n The patient, a beautiful girl of\\n      eighteen, had been bed- ridden for three years with supposed hip-joint\\n      disease. She was in college before assuming the ride of an invalid, and\\n      worried much over her studies and work. She sustained a fall a short time\\n      previously to taking to her bed, and to this fall the injury to the hip\\n      was attributed. She had been from physician to physician and from\\n      sanitarium to sanitarium without receiving benefit. All of the numerous\\n      medical men under whose care she had been, directed their attention to the\\n      hip and applied the classical treatment for morbus coxarius without avail.\\n      The patient had finally reached a point where introspection was her chief\\n      occupation and her mind dwelt almost continually upon a \"diseased\\n      hip.\" She was finally brought to me, coming in an invalid\\'s chair and\\n      looking the very picture of dependency. There was a slight degree of\\n      anaemia, though this was not marked. Notwithstanding the expression\\n      expression of abjectness the girl did not look seriously ill. The hip was\\n      excessively tender upon pressure, but there was no local increase of\\n      temperature, no evidences of fever and suppuration, and forcible\\n      apposition by striking the heel was not very painful. More less spastic\\n      contraction of the flexor muscles of the affected side existed, which gave\\n      to the limb an appearance of actual shortening, which was very deceptive.\\n      Hysterical symptoms were common. On examination I found the left ovary\\n      exquisitely tender. Compression of the ovary increased the pain in the hip\\n      most decidedly and gave rise to much nervous agitation. I did not,\\n      therefore, deem it wise to recommend local treatment other than the daily\\n      use of the hot douche. She had long been a victim of ovarian\\n      dysmenorrhoea. I placed upon the ankle of the affected limb three pounds\\n      of bar-lead, prescribed a pair of crutches and insisted upon her walking.\\n      The lead was used to overcome the spastic contraction as well as for its\\n      moral effect. I did not deem the joint lesion of such a character as to\\n      used extension. In two months\\' time this patient discarded her crutches\\n      for a cane. Six weeks later she put up the cane and is now perfectly well.\\n      \\n This was a case in which somewhat harsh\\n      measures were eminently appropriate.\\n      \\n In marked contrast to the case just\\n      recorded is the following: Mrs.-, aet. 47, widow for twenty years. She is\\n      a devoted church-woman, and for years was a leader in all charitable work\\n      done in the community in which she resided. Through friends she was urged\\n      to consult me, and I think that the call to the neighboring town in which\\n      she lived was countermanded at least four or five times before the finally\\n      mustered up courage and strength enough to see me. Upon reaching the\\n      bedside I found my patient in a room made dark by closed blinds, over\\n      which were hung heavy blankets to shut out every ray of light. The mirror\\n      was turned toward the wall for fear a ray of light might strike it and\\n      flesh throughout the darkened room. Nor did the patient rest under these\\n      extreme precautions, for the eyes were protected with two pairs of colored\\n      glasses with side attachments. Hyperaesthesia of the sense of hearing was\\n      equally marked and the noise was excluded from the room by double doors\\n      whose keyholes were stuffed with cotton. She l so had her ears filled with\\n      cotton, over which she wore ear-mufflers. She was emaciated to an extreme\\n      degree, and had been reduced to her miserable condition by a series of\\n      events which frequently precede profound neurasthenia. Her husband was\\n      killed during the war, and she was left childless. Twelve months previous\\n      to taking to her bed she nursed her mother through a long and fatal\\n      illness. This greatly prostrated her, yet she kept up until a favorite\\n      brother-in-law was thrown from a carriage and killed. This was the last\\n      straw, and the shock compelled her to take to her bed. In due time loss of\\n      appetite with irritability of the stomach developed, which, of course, led\\n      to marked depravity of nutrition. With the anaemia came hyperaesthesia of\\n      the special senses, spinal irritation, headache, hysterical\\n      manifestations, etc. There was no series pelvic lesion, although she had\\n      been much treated for an alleged uterine displacement with congestion.\\n      Unfortunately, she was encouraged, instead of discouraged, in her\\n      invalidism, and she soon became a nosomaniac of the worst type. She had\\n      written down her symptoms one at a time, and the record is such a typical\\n      one that I should like to give it in full, but time forbids.\\n      \\n With great difficulty the patient was\\n      moved on a cough to a private hospital and placed under the Weir Mitchell\\n      treatment. I ignored the pelvic trouble entirely. It is unnecessary to\\n      give in detail the progress of the case from day to day after this\\n      treatment was inaugurated. Suffice it to say that the improvement was of\\n      the most marked character, and in six weeks from the time she entered the\\n      hospital she walked to her carriage with her eyes and ears unprotected.\\n      She soon resumed her church and charitable work, in which she again takes\\n      much delight.\\n      \\n This woman wanted to get well. She was\\n      a woman of pure motives and high ideals. She had, in the language of Dr.\\n      Wesselhoeft, the wish, but, unaided, not the will. She required the aid of\\n      an intelligent, strong-minded, nurse who could bring to her exercise\\n      applied in such a way as to enable her to assimilate food without the\\n      expenditure of nerve force. She co- operated with her physician and nurse\\n      in every possible way, and as soon as the anaemic nerve cells became\\n      flushed with new blood she began to improve. To have commanded this\\n      patient \"to take up her bed and walk\" before improving her\\n      nutrition would have been as unscientific as to have placed the first\\n      patient in bed with extension and counter-extension applied to the limb. I\\n      know of no class of cases requiring for their successful treatment more\\n      tact and discrimination than that under consideration.\\n      \\n I feel confident that I have many times\\n      cut the affection short in its prodromal stage by removing the girl from\\n      college work and insisting upon open-air exercise. Static electricity has,\\n      in my hands, proved exceedingly useful both during the prodromal stage and\\n      that of convalescence.\\n      \\n I will conclude by saying that I have\\n      been impressed with the frequency with which an hereditary history of\\n      epilepsy has been met with in the cases of neurasthenia passing under my\\n      observation.'\n",
      " 'Tresorie - SOME OF THE DISEASES PREVENTING AND COMPLICATION PREGNANCY\\n[Diseases Preventing & Complicating Pregnancy]\\n\\n STERILITY.-DeSinety, Treub, Furbinger,\\n      et al., attribute 50 per cent. of unproductive marriages to the husbands,\\n      saying that sterility in the male is more often the cause of barren\\n      marriages than is generally supposed.\\n      \\n This cause of sterility I pass by, as\\n      also sterility due to mechanical obstruction, incomplete ovulation and the\\n      numerous other causes of this condition, too manifold for mere\\n      enumeration, to consider obesity as a causative agent in this condition. I\\n      need not say that the advocates for surgical interference for the relief\\n      of this condition are legion. Sims makes the assertion that sterility can\\n      be cured by surgical means only. That, of course, is Allopathic arguing\\n      pure and simple. Cases requiring surgical interference do arise, but any\\n      treatment which raises the nutrition of the entire organism, improves the\\n      blood-formation, and favors the resorption of pathological products in the\\n      sexual organs, is to be regarded as the indicated remedy.\\n      \\n Published statements are my authority\\n      for saying that excellent results have followed the administration of\\n      drugs, nevertheless; and in complete defiance of all therapeutic measures,\\n      a certain percentage of women remain barren; for with the more occult\\n      causes of sterility we remain, as yet, unacquainted, consequently they\\n      cannot all be reached with say kind of treatment whatever.\\n      \\n The following case I report somewhat in\\n      detail. Whilst not an exceptional case at all, it bears directly upon the\\n      subject under consideration, and possesses, it seems to me, some decidedly\\n      interesting features. My object in selecting this particular one is to\\n      call attention, if possible, to a condition not sufficiently considered.\\n      Mrs. J., aet. 26, married about two years and a half, appealed to my\\n      knowledge for a reason as to why she remained childless. The lady was\\n      carrying an excess of flesh, being under the medium height, and weighing\\n      186 pounds, but appeared to be in good health; family and previous history\\n      all that could be desired. Examination showed none of the common causes of\\n      sterility; neither, so far as I could ascertain, was the husband\\n      responsible for this unproductive condition of affairs. Some previous\\n      experiences of my own, with the added testimony of other and able men, was\\n      my reason for charging this condition of things to the excess of flesh,\\n      this, by the husband, being laughingly charged to excess of laziness.\\n      \\n We all, undoubtedly, are familiar with\\n      that peculiar disease of the blood-corpuscles which, whilst producing\\n      flesh, relaxes at the same time the muscular force; acting also, I\\n      believe, upon the muscular fibres of the uterus and upon the ovaries,\\n      inducing not only serious menstrual disorders but sterility. McKee,\\n      Philbert, and others give several instances of sterility chargeable to\\n      obesity, the women in question having been married several years without\\n      bearing children, and all became mothers after losing a portion of their\\n      flesh. If any other argument were needed in support of this theory we\\n      might turn to the quadrupeds, where we find the poorest breeders among the\\n      fleshiest animals. Fournel has a very able treatise on \"The Effects\\n      of Obesity on the Menstrual Functions and Parturition.\" Without\\n      having had any actual case of this description to deal with, he inclines\\n      very strongly towards the belief that obesity favors sterility. In the\\n      treatment of the case before mentioned, the patient was subjected to a\\n      daily massage of the entire body, with a special pelvic massage three\\n      times a week. This, in the main, consists in elevating the uterus as high\\n      as possible with the finger in the vagina, ending with a quick and decided\\n      vibratory motion. The diet received particular attention, as at this time\\n      there was a slight gastric ailment. The indicated remedy, Thuja, was given\\n      in the minimum dose. At the end of three months almost thirty pounds of\\n      flesh was gone, a considerable reduction. As an experiment, I recommended\\n      coitus in the knee-elbow position, advising that the lady remain quiet as\\n      long as possible after coition, with thighs well flexed. She became\\n      enciente, but miscarried at eight weeks. There was, comparatively\\n      speaking, but little pain and not much subsequent haemorrhage. She made a\\n      rapid recovery. Since then a living child has been born to them.\\n      \\n I believe I am safe in saying that this\\n      result would hardly have obtained were it not for the prophylactic\\n      measures adopted.\\n      \\n At the end of the first two months the\\n      patient was attacked with haemorrhage. A similar occurrence took place at\\n      irregular intervals during the following five months, the quantity of\\n      blood lost being much greater than that at the normal menstrual period.\\n      \\n For the greater part of the last five\\n      months she kept her bed, at the end of which time the tendency of the\\n      uterus to empty itself could be resisted no longer. A seven months\\' child\\n      was born, and is to-day doing well.\\n      \\n Pseudocyesis cerebral pregnancy,\\n      phantom pregnancy (whatever name we may call it by) is a disease which\\n      must come under the head of those \"complicating pregnancy.\" Mrs.\\n      M., a lady, married two or three years, aet. 29. Previous history good,\\n      always enjoying perfect health. When I first saw the lady in question she\\n      was a perfect picture of health, and, according to appearance and her own\\n      statements, about seven months pregnant. I made no examination. This\\n      appeared to be a thoroughly intelligent woman, and, according to her own\\n      statement, there was cessation of the menses. There certainly was an\\n      enlargement of the abdomen and breasts, a milky secretion, and the lady\\n      was sure that she felt foetal movement. On February 28th of the present\\n      year I was called to attend her in labor. Examination showed that no\\n      pregnancy existed. So far as I could ascertain there was no assignable\\n      origin for this condition other than nervous influences, the phenomena\\n      being purely muscular distension of the abdomen.\\n      \\n Mayham reports a case of a woman 73\\n      years old, claiming to be pregnant; he also claims that subsequently she\\n      was delivered of a child; this is an Allopathic report, however, of which\\n      we will take a Homoeopathic dose. Haultain reports three cases of cerebral\\n      pregnancy. In the first, he says no cause whatever was to be found; in the\\n      second, there was a small fibroid growth in the anterior uterine wall.\\n      Hauck reports a case where the vomiting, peristalsis, and flatus, caused\\n      by alcoholism were supposed to be caused by the pregnant state. Such cases\\n      are uncommon, but they emphasize the importance of making a thorough\\n      examination, in all cases where positive information is desired of the\\n      existence or non-existence of pregnancy.\\n      \\n Hyperemesis Gravidarum.-An animated\\n      discussion, held recently between two celebrated Allopaths of Stuttgart\\n      and Leipsic, has served to awaken a renewed interest in this subject,\\n      without in the least adding anything new to our stock of knowledge\\n      regarding its aetiology. Notwithstanding the frequency of the vomiting of\\n      pregnancy, its very distressing character in many instances, and its\\n      imminent, its very distressing character in many instances, and its\\n      imminent danger, we find but very few contributions of any value, to\\n      either the aetiology of the disorder or its therapeutics. I do not expect\\n      to add anything specially new myself, but it does seem to me that our\\n      knowledge of the vomiting of pregnancy, is to say the least, in a most\\n      contradictory state. Some physicians look upon it as a trifling matter,\\n      others as a thing to be endured, and some-these are in the right too-view\\n      even the mildest cases with gravity. Even in the mildest cases of morning\\n      sickness there is a constant drain upon the nervous system, putting the\\n      sufferer into a condition, in which she is very much less able to endure\\n      parturition than she would otherwise have been.\\n      \\n Dr. Harrison Mettler says: \"After\\n      careful inquiry I find that women who suffer from much morning sickness\\n      have as a rule, tedious or otherwise troublesome labors. I have observed\\n      in multiparae that at one time they will have much nausea and vomiting\\n      followed by a difficult labor, while at another time they will be quite\\n      free from the vomiting, and will pass through the succeeding labor with\\n      comparative ease.\" I must say my observations make me agree with Dr.\\n      Mettler entirely; when one thinks how rapidly the mildest of cases assume\\n      pernicious forms, indifference is certainly no longer to be excused. There\\n      is a voluminous literature upon this subject, and many and varied are the\\n      aetiological reasons given for this very variable affection, a large\\n      majority of writers coinciding in the opinion that \"many causes\\n      operate together,\" to produce what we are pleased to designate the\\n      \"vomiting of pregnancy.\" I believe myself that in a large\\n      percentage of cases, this pernicious vomiting is simply the result of a\\n      reflex neurosis. Undoubtedly uterine displacements frequently cause\\n      vomiting; but when this is so, and the displaced organ is raised by\\n      packing the vagina with aseptic wool, the vomiting ceases.\\n      \\n Lillie reports a number of cases, where\\n      obstinate vomiting was caused by a retroflexed uterus, and restoration of\\n      the organ caused a cessation of the disorder. Bezugloff having a\\n      persistent case of morning sickness, introduced a bougie it no the uterus,\\n      the intention being to produce abortion; the immediate result was a\\n      stoppage of the vomiting, and the pregnancy went on to full term.\\n      \\n In the case just cited, I must say that\\n      I believe it was the fright, caused by the thought of abortion being\\n      performed, more than the effects of introducing the bougie, which operated\\n      so successfully; I say now, as I said before, I believe that the\\n      pre-eminent cause of this kind of sickness must be looked for i the\\n      nervous system. Flint speaks of this form of sickness as being decidedly\\n      neurotic in its origin, and cites a number of cases of a chronic variety\\n      of dyspepsia frequently occurring in young girls. I had one such case come\\n      under my personal care. There was a persistent morning sickness, with this\\n      young lady, and a disagreeable nausea whenever food was taken; this\\n      patient was at some distance from her home, in a boarding school, and she\\n      will probably never know that the lady principal entertained very grave\\n      thoughts at one time in regard to her virtue. It certainly was very\\n      difficult to differentiate between this and the vomiting of pregnancy; it\\n      was, however, simply due to a vitiated nervous system. My theory is\\n      supported by Alt, who records a number of such cases; I cite one only, the\\n      case being that of a highly hysterical woman, six months pregnant,\\n      suffering from the gravest vomiting, and anxious that miscarriage be\\n      induced. She was making preparation for entering the hospital for this\\n      purpose, when one of her children was seized with pneumonia. The anxiety\\n      felt over the child, forced all thought of self from the mother\\'s mind;\\n      from that moment the vomiting ceased and she remained well until the\\n      termination of pregnancy.-Minchener Medicinische Wochenschrift.\\n      \\n Whilst saying that I believe this\\n      disease to be in the majority of cases of purely nervous origin, I would\\n      not imply thereby that it is not to be feared, far from it; if neglected,\\n      we know how likely it is to pass quickly beyond treatment and our patient\\n      succumb from sheer exhaustion.\\n      \\n In the treatment cited such as\\n      insertion of bougies, dilation of the os, pelvic massage, etc., I believe\\n      it is merely the \"doing something,\" no matter much what it is,\\n      so long as you have gained the confidence of your patient, that does good.\\n      We have seen how suddenly Hyperemesis will cease if the patient be\\n      alarmed; it may be, has often been, and will to again, cured by a process\\n      skin to suggestion. Kattenback had a case where the patient, a primipara,\\n      was seized with an incorrigible vomiting. It was suggested to her that her\\n      stomach contained some lumps of unwholesome material and their removal\\n      would cure her. Some milk was given her, and the stomach ceremoniously\\n      washed out. its contents bore no indications of either over-acidity or\\n      abnormal ferment She was informed that she was all right and the vomiting\\n      would not return; neither did if, and she was safely delivered at term.\\n      \\n There is a familiar and now well-know\\n      phenomena, by which these neurotics can be influenced; I speak of\\n      hypnotism; it is due to purely subjective conditions.\\n      \\n There is an identity of the hypnotic\\n      susceptibility with the condition of hysteria, and it is along these lines\\n      that we can work. Just as many times as I have tried this method of\\n      treatment, for these cases of excessive vomiting, just so many times has\\n      it given me gratifying results.\\n      \\n The patient can be to sleep by\\n      bi-ocular pressure, and the idea of cure suggested; the operation may have\\n      to be repeated several times, at intervals of a day or so, but you will be\\n      rewarded by the cessation of the vomiting, often with but one suggestion.\\n      Where the patient is not easily controlled by means of the bi-ocular\\n      pressure, Luy\\'s revolving mirror is a never failing resource.'\n",
      " 'Tresorie - PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS [Presidential Address]\\n\\n THE ROLE OF HOMOEOPATHY IN THE SECOND\\n      \\n By ALVA BENJAMIN, M.B.CH.B., F.F.HOM.\\n      \\n Such a system of medicine must\\n      recognize that it is as much an art as a science, and that healing is a\\n      relationship between two living personalities. It must recognize too, that\\n      the sick individual has to take an active part in his treatment and not be\\n      merely the passive recipient of this or that treatment. For just as it is\\n      rightly said that man does not live by alone, so should it be emphasized\\n      that man cannot be cured by medicine alone. He must see to it himself that\\n      he lives as far as possible a physically and psychically healthy life.\\n      Indeed, each individual has a power within himself to help in his own\\n      cure.\\n      \\n Do the official schools of medicine\\n      teach such an art today? I am afraid not: they are so intent on seeking\\n      the specific treatment for this or that named disease or the antibiotic\\n      that will most effectively put out of action the organism regarded as the\\n      cause of the disease, that they are losing sight of the individual\\n      himself.\\n      \\n But Homoeopathy in its persistent\\n      search for the reactions of the individual to his environment in the\\n      broadest sense, no matter of what the patient is complaining surely\\n      fulfills these requirements, especially when it is recognized that the\\n      homoeopathic potencies do not anything to the patient as do the drugs of\\n      the dominant school, but rather stimulate the patients own recuperative\\n      powers to overcome the infection or re - establish the normal metabolism\\n      which has become deranged by the illness.\\n      \\n When you consider how the homoeopathic\\n      physician diagnoses the individuality of his patient over and above the\\n      name of the disease from which he is suffering, and uses for the purpose\\n      of his prescription rather than the name of the disease this personal\\n      diagnosis of the patients mental and emotional reactions, his responses to\\n      changes in weather conditions, the alternations in his environment which\\n      influence his symptoms, etc., one realize how very individualistic is the\\n      Homoeopathic prescription fitted to that particular patient.\\n      \\n The homoeopathic physician does not\\n      seek for a remedy specific to any named disease and which he can thus\\n      apply almost automatically once he has made his organic diagnosis, which\\n      in quite an appreciable number of instances may ultimately be found to be\\n      wrong and so the treatment based upon it must therefore have been wrong.\\n      He does not, as is so often done, merely suppress the most outstanding\\n      symptom by an appropriate drug; for example giving an anodyne to mask the\\n      pain or removing the skin eruption by some strong local application, in\\n      other words putting the dust under the mat and pretending the room is\\n      clean.\\n      \\n Strangely enough the homoeopathic\\n      physician is often accused by his allopathic critic in his ignorance of\\n      Homoeopathy, of merely treating symptoms, whereas it is the critic himself\\n      who practices this superficial medicine. The homoeopathic physician, on\\n      the other hand, treats his patient as a whole through his symptoms and\\n      their modifications through changes in the environment, which is quite a\\n      different matter.\\n      \\n Homoeopathic therapy, unlike methods of\\n      treatment, is based on a natural law \"Similia Similibus\\n      Curentur\" \"Likes may be cured by likes\" which has been\\n      proved time and time again by experiment and which anyone with the will to\\n      do may prove for himself. It is not subject to constant change brought\\n      about by this or that latest discovery, and which itself will soon have to\\n      give way to the still later idea.\\n      \\n Having now introduced to you our actor,\\n      what of the scene in which he is to play his role?\\n      \\n This is the nineteen hundred and fifty\\n      - fourth year of the Christian era and the second year of the reign of our\\n      much loved and admired young Queen Elizabeth II, who will remember while\\n      in south Africa on her twenty - first birthday, before she had any idea\\n      that she would so soon be called to such an exalted position as she holds\\n      today, broadcast to the commonwealth and Empire her resolve to dedicate\\n      her life to the service of this grand community which dedication she\\n      recently repeated at her Coronation.\\n      \\n Here in Great Britain we have a more or\\n      less complete welfare state, with which idea some of us may very strongly\\n      disagree, whilst others believe such a development is the result of a\\n      natural very desirable social evolution.\\n      \\n As one necessary ingredient of this\\n      welfare state came, in 1948, the initiation of the National Health\\n      Service, through which the great majority of the population receives its\\n      medical attention, although it is rightly available to all.\\n      \\n When we come to consider the role that\\n      homoeo - therapeutics should play in this scheme, I would suggest that we\\n      should regard the problem from the purely medical aspect, forgetting any\\n      political party allegiances or sympathies we may have; or if we cannot\\n      forget them we should remember that the organization of the National\\n      Insurance Scheme of which the National Health Service is but a part, was\\n      first blue printed by the well - known Liberal supporter, Lord Beveridge,\\n      and the Health Service plans developed by the Coalition Government of all\\n      three major political parties.\\n      \\n We are living at present in an age\\n      which may very justifiably be regarded as a violent age in which have been\\n      developed so many appalling instruments of destruction, the use of some of\\n      which we are quite complacently accepting and from the use of others we\\n      are refraining, not because we consider them immoral, but simply through\\n      the fear of the wholesale destruction which would be caused by their use.\\n      We are seeing X-rays used in very high voltages in the treatment of\\n      cancer, we are being constantly remained of the use of dangerous drugs in\\n      medicine, without justification, in my opinion, bearing in mind the\\n      doubtful and evanescent ameliorations they produce and the violent\\n      surgical treatment of mental patients.\\n      \\n One further violence we should not\\n      forget is the way some of our foods are devitalized by the extraction of\\n      this or that portion of the natural product for purposes quite foreign to\\n      the well - being of the people who are to feed on them; or they are\\n      contaminated by the addition of this or that dangerous chemical, either\\n      during the growing of the plant, in the form of sprays, or as so called\\n      improvers in, for instance, the manufacture of white bread. It is very\\n      significant in this regard that quite a lot of attention is paid to the\\n      protection of the man who sprays the crops, but the right of the consumer\\n      to have uncontaminated food is slurred over by the unjustifiable statement\\n      that the amount of these chemicals so consumed is so small that it cannot\\n      have any bad effect on the consumer. We who practice Homoeopathy know how\\n      unwarranted is such a statement.\\n      \\n Can we homoeopathic physicians and\\n      patient hope to be able to do anything to make the still small voice of\\n      Homoeopathy heard in all this tumult, so that we may return to a saner and\\n      more healthful way of life and help our young Queen in her lifes work for\\n      the communitys sake?\\n      \\n Can we expect any help from the leaders\\n      of the medical profession? I am afraid not, because although I believe it\\n      accurate to state that there is a very slowly growing interest in, and\\n      tolerance of our work by individual doctors, the medical authorities are\\n      still, in their prejudice, strongly opposed to us. The London University\\n      still refuses to recognize our Hospital as a post - graduate teaching\\n      Hospital: the British Medical Association prohibits the formation of a\\n      homoeopathic section of its organization, and the Royal College of\\n      Physicians still refuses its membership to any one known as a homoeopathic\\n      physician. Yet in spite of this unfavourable environment, I firmly believe\\n      that there is a future for our method of therapeutics: but it will have to\\n      be pursued with courage, determination, foresight and energy. Surely if we\\n      believe as I do, that we are the guardians of a system of treatment\\n      destined to make our people healthier and therefore more efficient and\\n      happier, we would be failing in our duty to our country if we did not take\\n      every means in our power to acquaint the community at large with the\\n      advantages of this system and the dangers of ignoring it. This is a duty,\\n      not only of the profession, but also of the laity interested in\\n      Homoeopathy and who have experienced its benefits.\\n      \\n Every physician has two professional\\n      obligation to the community, that of preserving its health and that of\\n      endeavouring to restore it to being when it has fallen by the way.\\n      \\n The homoeopathic physician, thorough\\n      his knowledge acquired through the provings of drugs, even in\\n      infinitesimal doses, has, I believe, a very special responsibility as\\n      regards the prophylaxis of disease. It seems to me that a great deal of\\n      chronic ill health may quite conceivably be due to the manipulations of\\n      our foods and to the artificial manuring of the ground in which many of\\n      them are grown. Experiments have been carried our proving that plants\\n      grown in soil enriched by natural manuring, are much less prone to\\n      diseases than those grown with the help of artificial chemical manures. It\\n      seems a fairly justified conclusion that vegetables grown under these\\n      artificial conditions may quite well be deficient in something necessary\\n      for our perfect health. It is therefore incumbent upon the physician to\\n      advocate whenever possible the ingestion of healthily grown foods in the\\n      widest sense of that term.\\n      \\n The same duty applies when we consider\\n      the great amount of drugging in which the community at large indulges by\\n      its excessive smoking, particularly when aggravated by the practice of\\n      inhaling, and by the continued and prolonged use of drugs for this or that\\n      symptom, too often, unfortunately, though not always, on the prescription\\n      of their medical advisors.\\n      \\n There is a great lack throughout the\\n      community of any real enthusiasm for perfect health: we are only too prone\\n      to be content to follow like sheep, the unintelligent and harmful\\n      practices of the majority of our fellows.\\n      \\n Similarly in the curative realm, we\\n      homoeopathic physicians have special obligations.\\n      \\n When considering our position vis-a-vis\\n      the rest of the profession, we must never lose sight of the fact that our\\n      approach to the sick individual is a much broader and more comprehensive\\n      one than that of the dominant school. This latter prides itself on its\\n      scientific approach to its problems. One must, however, always be on ones\\n      guard against being hypnotized by that word scientific. The scientific\\n      aspect of any phenomenon or problem dealing with humanity is only one\\n      limited aspect of that problem. To get a complete picture one must\\n      consider other aspect, such as the aesthetic, emotional, maybe religious,\\n      and above all, perhaps one might say embracing all, the philosophical\\n      approach. This complex approach to his patients problem is the one that\\n      the homoeopathic physician always strives to adopt, and so never loses\\n      sight of the ego of the patient, while at the same time not forgetting his\\n      physical make - up.\\n      \\n Because this approach of ours to our\\n      patients is a much broader and more comprehensive one than the much\\n      vaunted scientific aspect, which the dominant school has come to regard as\\n      the Ultima Thule of medicine, I deplore the oft - repeated request of some\\n      of my colleagues that we should forsake our philosophy and make our work\\n      as scientific as theirs. I do not mean to imply by this that we should\\n      neglect the scientific angle of our patients illness but we should always\\n      remember that is only one facet of our problem. That is why we take such\\n      pains to diagnose our patients personality with his reaction to his\\n      environment in addition to the physical diagnosis of the case in order to\\n      arrive at our prescription for his malady. In other words, we should\\n      endeavour to lead our dominant school colleagues to our way of thinking,\\n      rather than that we should adopt theirs.\\n      \\n At the same time must always remember\\n      that if our philosophy should seem at any time to contradict so - called\\n      scientific laws, we must re - examine our philosophy, and if necessary\\n      modify it, while at the same time remembering that many times in the past\\n      what have been regarded as laws have ultimately been proved not to be so.\\n      Thus it is evident that we must never relax our self - examination.\\n      \\n What shall be the role of the\\n      homoeopathic laity?\\n      \\n The first thing for them to remember is\\n      that we are living in a democratic country whose government is dependent\\n      on the goodwill of the governed, and that, if a sufficient number of\\n      voters desire a certain line of action, that line will be adopted by the\\n      government.\\n      \\n The second thought is that there are\\n      not nearly sufficient doctors practising Homoeopathy in Great Britain to\\n      satisfy the present demand, let alone any further increased demand in the\\n      future, for this line of treatment.\\n      \\n Does not this seem strange, having\\n      regard to the great advantage to humanity that Homoeopathy provides? Not\\n      if one looks below the surface and so finds the reason for this shortage.\\n      \\n Surely the most potent reason is that\\n      Homoeopathy is not taught in the official Medical Schools, either as a pre\\n      - or post - graduate study. The London University when asked to recognize\\n      the Royal London Homoeopathic Hospital as a post - graduate Medical\\n      School, refused on the plea that as Homoeopathy was not taught in the\\n      undergraduate Medical Schools, it could not find a place for it in its\\n      post - graduate curriculum.\\n      \\n It is, of course, nonsense to suggest\\n      that a graduate should pursue his studies only in those subject of which\\n      he had already obtained some knowledge in his undergraduate days and\\n      should not wish to obtain information on any new or extra subject.\\n      \\n The University Medical Shools are\\n      enabled to a great extent through Government grants. We must therefore\\n      find some way of influencing whatever Government be in power to bring\\n      pressure to bear upon the London University to remove this obstacle to the\\n      better health of the community at large. I am quite satisfied that once\\n      this academic recognition is obtained we shave many more post - graduate\\n      students of Homoeopathy.\\n      \\n I believe than in a democratic\\n      community, having a universal State Medical Service, it is the bounden\\n      duty of the Government to remove all obstacles to the peoples obtaining\\n      that form of medical treatment in which they have confidence. So long as\\n      Homoeopathy is denied its legitimate status, so long must be Government be\\n      deemed to b failing in its duty to the country.\\n      \\n If, however, we are to achieve this\\n      desirable object of full recognition, we must all, professional and laity,\\n      be fired with enthusiasm, not only for the abstract cause of Homoeopathy,\\n      but for being partners with our young Queen in delicating our lives to the\\n      community.\\n      \\n When we do this we shall help to make\\n      this second Elizabethan era one to be remembered throughout the ages to\\n      come as surpassing the first Elizabethan era in that it gained not so much\\n      the economic and political leadership of the world - though that is not to\\n      be despised - but showed the way to the most healthful and spiritual way\\n      of life that all the world look notice and followed suit.\\n      \\n To sum up, the Role of Homoeopathy, as\\n      I see it, is to humanize the practice of medicine. By that I mean it must\\n      bring the practice of medicine into line with a reasoned philosophy of\\n      life, restore to it its artistry and rid it of all unnecessary hazards. It\\n      is to do this, not from any abstract academic sense of superiority, but in\\n      order the years to come are not those of merely another reign, but to\\n      ensure a veritable Renaissance, starting with the second Elizabethan era\\n      in which Great Britain will take its rightful place in the comity of\\n      nations as the pathfinder to a way of life for which posterity will be\\n      able to say \"Thank God for Queen Elizabeth the Second and her\\n      peoples.'\n",
      " 'Tresorie - Roentgenometric Pelvimetry [Roentgenometric Pelvimetry]\\n CHARLES W.PERKINS, M.D.\\n      \\n Norwalk, Conn\\n      \\n FOR some time the x-ray has been used\\n      to advantage in diagnosis of multiple pregnancy, position of fetus and\\n      fetal abnormalities. However, it has been only the past four or five years\\n      that any definite information has been obtained by roentgenographic\\n      methods of diagnoses in pelvimetry.\\n      \\n At the present time we are convinced\\n      that only by means of roentgenographs can be true proportions of the\\n      superior strait be determined, and that the ordinary external methods of\\n      Pelvimetry are not only occasionally misleading but proportionately\\n      inaccurate.\\n      \\n The present communication deals with\\n      the method of Herbert Thomas of Yale University. This method was developed\\n      in cooperation with the late Dr. W.A. Lafield, who was Professor of\\n      Roentgenology at the Yale Medical School.\\n      \\n Some of the reasons why roentgen\\n      pelvimetry has not been more universally adopted are probably due to the\\n      following factors.\\n      \\n (1) The majority of women will be\\n      delivered normally, whether or not pelvic measurements are made.\\n      \\n (2) The medical profession does not\\n      readily accept a new method after an established satisfactory routine has\\n      been in use.\\n      \\n (3) A new method of diagnosis incurs\\n      added expense.\\n      \\n (4) The present methods, although\\n      entirely speculative, are satisfactory in most cases.\\n      \\n (5) Roentgen pelvimetry cannot be\\n      performed by the obstetrician himself but requires the aid of a\\n      roentgenologist.\\n      \\n (6) The value of roentgenometric\\n      diagnosis is recent in origin and as yet not universally accepted.\\n      \\n If the knowledge of the size and shape\\n      of the pelvis is necessary to the practice of obstetrics, roentgen\\n      pelvimetry is a sound procedure, particularly in pre-emptors patients, and\\n      should and should be considered as an indispensable aid in these cases.\\n      \\n The method of Herbert Thoms as\\n      developed at Yale Medical School is not the only method. However, it can\\n      be classified as simple, accurate and rapid; being adaptable for use by\\n      other than experts in x-ray and obstetric diagnosis. As a technical\\n      procedure a well trained hospital technician can master its technic alter\\n      sufficient instruction.\\n      \\n Studies of recent years reveal the fact\\n      that external Pelvimetry fails to give uniform and accurate information in\\n      regard to the shape and size of the superior strait. This is often true of\\n      thin undersized individuals. In many patients of this type external\\n      measurements may suggest a contracted pelvis while the x-ray will show a\\n      relatively large pelvis with a subsequent natural labor and normal-sized\\n      child. On the other hand a stocky short person with similar external\\n      measurements will disclose a contracted pelvis which is an obstetric\\n      problem. Because of the apparent relationship between shortening of the\\n      transverse diameter and a secondary persistent occipito-posterior\\n      presentation, accurate information regarding this diameter is of clinical\\n      significance.\\n      \\n The observations of Thomas were made on\\n      twenty consecutive patients whose pelvis showed a relative or real\\n      shortening of the transverse diameter of the superior strait. In every\\n      instance a primary or secondary occipito posterior position was found\\n      after the patient was in labor. (Herbert Thoms, Surgery, Gynecology and\\n      Obstetrics, January, 1933). It therefore has been proved that an actual or\\n      relative shortening of a transverse diameter of the superior strait\\n      results in a limitation of space that is greater in the anterior than in\\n      the posterior half of the superior strait. Under these circumstances, when\\n      the head descends early in labor, the occiput is forced to rotate\\n      posteriorly.\\n      \\n The x-ray offers additional information\\n      in determining the size of the fetal head. It has been noted in x-ray\\n      examination of the unengaged fetal head that it lay with the transverse\\n      diameter of the superior strait, the occiput being either to the right or\\n      left; therefore, if roentgenogram of the patient is taken in the supine\\n      position with the fetus in the uterus, it will cast a shadow which is an\\n      enlarged profile of the head. The measurements of the occipital frontal\\n      diameter of the head can then be made. On numerous occasions this method\\n      of cephalometry, determining the diameter of the unmoulded head before and\\n      after cesarean section, has yielded accurate results. (Thomas, A.M.A.,\\n      February 24, 1934).\\n      \\n As experience increases in roentgen\\n      pelvimetry, the so-called labor test will be employed less. This, however,\\n      does not mean that the physician should not under estimate the importance\\n      of uterine contraction and the ability of the fetal head to mold. It has\\n      always followed that when something could be proved desirable in medicine\\n      for the better protection of the patient, such an advance would be\\n      demanded and eventually become routine. We may concede, therefore, that\\n      roentgen pelvimetry has a distinct place in the examination of every\\n      primiparous woman. In many instances, according to Thomas and others,\\n      external; measurements were normal but the x-ray examination revealed a\\n      contracted pelvis. On the other had, in certain patients whose external\\n      measurements suggested a cesarean section roentgen pelvimetry proved\\n      otherwise and they were subsequently delivered in a normal manner.\\n      \\n CENTIMETER GRID METHOD.\\n      \\n The procedure in this method may be\\n      summarized by stating the following:.\\n      \\n (1) The patient is placed on the\\n      roentgenographic table in the semi- recumbent position.\\n      \\n (2) The level of the superior strait\\n      above the sensitized film is established.\\n      \\n (3) The tube target is centered about\\n      five centimeters posterior to the symphysis, at thirty-two inches from the\\n      sensitized film, The exposure is made.\\n      \\n (4) The patient is removed from the\\n      table, the tube target and sensitized film remaining in situ.\\n      \\n (5) A lead plate, or centimeter grid,\\n      with perforations exactly one centimeter apart, is introduced into the\\n      same plane as that previously occupied by the superior strait and a second\\n      (flash) exposure is made on the same sensitized film as was used used in\\n      the previous exposure.\\n      \\n (6) Development of the film shows the\\n      outline of the superior strait and the shadows of the perforations, the\\n      assistance between which represents centimeters in the plane of the\\n      superior strait. The anteroposterior and transverse diameters of the\\n      superior strait in its use proportions may be drawn on centimeter-square\\n      paper by following the course of the shadow of the superior strait and\\n      transcribing it.\\n      \\n As this time I wish to express my\\n      thanks to Dr. Thoms for his personal advice and instruction which helped\\n      me to master the technic of his method.'\n",
      " 'Tresorie - NOTATU DIGNUM [Test Of A Homoeopath]\\n\\n Complaints are not unfrequently made\\n      that the homoeopathic materia medica is too vast for practical utility;\\n      that the schematised list of symptoms are unprofitable, if not impossible\\n      reading.

      " 'Tresorie - THE EFFICACY OF THE VIBROMETER IN APPLYING VIBRATORY MASSAGE\\nIN AURAL DISEASES [Efficacy Of Vibrometer In Applying Vibratory Message In Aural\\nDisease]\\n\\n SINCE presenting my paper before the\\n      American Institute, in June of last year on \"Vibratory Motion as a\\n      Method of Massage in Aural Diseases,\" I have been using an instrument\\n      specially devised for that purpose called the \"vibrometer.\" This\\n      instrument is in shape like a banjo, and has four strings stretched across\\n      its length resting on a bridge, which sets upon a diaphragm. On each side,\\n      elevated above the diaphragm and supported by posts, are two horizontal\\n      bars, which support the mechanical appliances used for producing the\\n      various vibratory motions. This consists in what is called a yoke, in\\n      which revolves a shaft connected with the electro-motor by pulley-wheels\\n      and a belt. Behind the diaphragm is a shallow air-tight compartment,\\n      leading from which are rubber tubes that are inserted in the external\\n      auditory canal during treatment, consequently any vibratory motion of the\\n      diaphragm, which must necessarily be an inward and a corresponding outward\\n      movement, would be exactly reproduced upon the membrana tympani, as the\\n      confined air, not being able to escape, will undergo an alternate\\n      condensation and rarefication in the external auditory canal.\\n      \\n Every vibratory movement of the strings\\n      of the instrument is communicated to the diaphragm by means of the bridge\\n      upon which it rests. These strings by varying their tension and length can\\n      be regulated to give a high or low rate of vibration as desired, for\\n      instance, the heaviest string left at its original length adjusted to a\\n      slight tension may make about fifty vibratory motions to the second, while\\n      the highest string on the instrument adjusted to a high tension and\\n      clamped down to one-fourth its original length would probably make three\\n      thousand vibratory motions to the second.\\n      \\n In the centre of the diaphragm is an\\n      attachment which works on a lever, and when hit by the cam on the\\n      revolving shaft lifts the diaphragm to a considerable extent, causing a\\n      powerful effect on the membrana tympani. This attachment can be adjusted\\n      at four different leverages, which causes a modification or increase of\\n      its intensity and can be regulated at from one to twenty-five vibratory\\n      movements to the second. This is only used in very bad cases and for not\\n      more than five minutes continuously.\\n      \\n The instrument which I have been\\n      describing in an improvement on the first manufactured, and as far as I\\n      know, is the only one which offers the same facilities for applying this\\n      method of massage. The class of patients in my experience who are\\n      generally benefited from the first, are those in which the mucous membrane\\n      lining the tympanic cavity and Eustachian tubes is in a hypertrophic\\n      condition. The membrana tympani are depressed, opaque, and thickened. They\\n      usually complain of a stiffed sensation in the ears, with a great deal of\\n      tinnitus aurium, and that their hearing is worse during a cold. In cases\\n      where the mucous membranes are atrophied with a large external auditory\\n      canal perfectly dry and Eustachian tubes patulous, and generally very\\n      little tinnitus, this or no other treatment has done very much good in the\\n      majority of cases, and in looking ever my records I find that only about\\n      five per cent. have been relieved, while in the before-mentioned cases the\\n      good results reach at least seventy-five per cent. In treating persons, I\\n      always select the rate of vibration which corresponds in pitch, if\\n      possible, to that caused by the diseased condition of the ears. If there\\n      is no tinnitus to guide me, I find whether the patient can hear a high or\\n      low sound better; if it is a low sound, a high rate of vibration is used\\n      in treatment, and vice versa, A point which I would like to explain here\\n      is this: It is not necessary that the sound from the instrument should be\\n      of the same quality of the tinnitus experienced by the patient, but merely\\n      the same pitch. for instance, if a banjo, where one of the strings was\\n      adjusted when sounded to produce a certain note, and a musical instrument\\n      of any other kind, whose quality of tone was entirely different, was made\\n      to sound the same note in a room, the string on the banjo would vibrate in\\n      sympathy, which has been proven by experiment, any other note, no matter\\n      how loud, would have no effect. Another point is in the way the strings of\\n      the vibrometer are set in motion. On the revolving shaft is a wheel\\n      projecting from which are metallic picks which hit the string it is\\n      adjusted over. It does not make any difference in the number of vibratory\\n      motions per second, whether the string is hit fast or slow, but at the\\n      time the string is first hit the intensity is greater than it is just\\n      before being hit again, and as the motion of the wheel is perfectly\\n      rhythmic, revolving so many times to the second, it has just as good an\\n      effect as if the intensity during the fraction of a second did not vary at\\n      all. The idea of using vibratory motion, as I have said before, originated\\n      within my mind some years ago, and later put into practical operation, and\\n      as far as I know, was the first to lay before the profession in a\\n      scientific manner, this method of massage.\\n      \\n I have found that when two of the\\n      strings upon the vibrometer were regulated in such a way that when both\\n      were set in vibration at the same time, producing the sensation of a\\n      harmonious sound, the effect in some cases on the tinnitus was especially\\n      beneficial, relieving, where the various kinds of vibrations produced by a\\n      single string failed. Sub-acute cases of deafness, accompanied by tinnitus\\n      aurium, are quickly relieved, as the following case will illustrate:.\\n      \\n Mrs. M. Young, married lady, aet. 26,\\n      called at my office, April 1, 1893, complaining of partial deafness and\\n      tinnitus aurium. She had a stuffed sensation, or as if cotton had been\\n      packed in the external auditory canal. She says the tinnitus was so\\n      annoying as to prevent sleep. On examination, found considerable\\n      retraction of the membrana tympani, and hearing for the watch, on the\\n      right side five inches, on the left, seven inches. The Eustachian tube\\n      were partially closed, which made inflation somewhat difficult, giving\\n      slight relief. I used several of the vibrations on the different strings\\n      without immediate benefit.\\n      \\n April 4th.-She came again, and reported\\n      that no improvement had taken place. I again inflated her ears, after\\n      which she sat down to the vibrometer. The central attachment was used with\\n      considerable force continuously for four minutes, after which she declared\\n      that the tinnitus had entirely ceased in the right ear, and greatly\\n      modified in the left; the hearing for the watch had increased for both\\n      ears to fourteen inches, and the stuffed sensation had almost entirely\\n      disappeared. On inspection of the membrana tympani, found them\\n      comparatively very slightly retracted. On April 8th, found improvement had\\n      continued, when the same treatment was used for three minutes; after which\\n      she declared herself completely relieved of the tinnitus and stuffed\\n      sensation, with hearing powerfully restored. Saw her again on April 13th,\\n      when she declared the good results from last treatment to have still\\n      continued.\\n      \\n I find that in the majority of cases,\\n      when the strings of the instrument are used it is only necessary to strike\\n      them lightly with the friction wheel. In vibrating the heavy string, I\\n      generally set the bridge back behind the central attachment, and adjusting\\n      the motor in such way that the belt is at a considerable tension, so that\\n      the pulley-wheel revolves slowly. I also generally use this adjustment\\n      when setting in motion two strings at one time. The principle of this\\n      method of treatment embraces two essential features which to my mind makes\\n      this system of massage the only scientific one applicable to the membrana\\n      tympani and its associate sound-conducting parts. Message is the\\n      application of motion to disease, and its scientific administration\\n      consists of its application in a systematic manner. In applying massage in\\n      aural diseases, it is necessary to produce a to-and-fro movement of the\\n      membrana tympani, and, if possible, by a force which is harmless and at\\n      the same time effective. The vibrometer fulfils these conditions. Any of\\n      the strings on the instrument that may be set in motion by the\\n      friction-wheel, will produce a certain number of vibratory movements to\\n      the second of time, and the movements of the central attachment are also\\n      measured. What could be more systematic than this? The motions of the\\n      membrana tympani were intended by nature to its vibratory, and as the\\n      vibrometer generates measured motion, and these motions are vibratory,\\n      theoretically we have a scientific and effective method of massage in\\n      aural diseases; and, as demonstrated practically by the use of the\\n      vibrometer, we have in fact a great scientific advance over all previous\\n      methods. Since the introduction of this treatment in aural diseases, it\\n      makes possible a more or less benefit in cases of deafness heretofore\\n      considered hopeless, and has opened up the field for the treatment of\\n      aural diseases to such an extent that the number of deaf patients seeking\\n      relief at the aurist\\'s hands will at least double itself.\\n      \\n DISCUSSION.\\n      \\n H.C. HOUGHTON, M.D.: Dr. Garey\\'s\\n      admirable paper gives us the description of the vibrometer, an instrument\\n      devised under his personal direction and inspection, for the purpose of\\n      applying massage to the ear. It is the only instrument of the kind on the\\n      market, so far as I am aware, and after a somewhat prolonged use of it, I\\n      am prepared to recommend the latest production of the vibrometer company.\\n      \\n This instrument is a decided\\n      improvement over the instrument first sent out, and is capable of\\n      producing a most profound effect upon the drum-head and ossicula; indeed,\\n      upon the entire auditory apparatus. I am able to confirm Dr. Garey\\'s\\n      statement of the effect of high and low vibrations us regards treatment.\\n      \\n I have also been very much interested\\n      in the use of stringed or reed instruments for diagnosis, and find that we\\n      can detect any abnormal sensitiveness of the auditory nerve to high or low\\n      tones. Some patients are extremely sensitive to all tones, high or low;\\n      others to high tones and not to low tones; others, conversely. Again, in\\n      some instances, there is a peculiar sensitiveness to single tones or to\\n      discords produced by sounding the note and half-note at the same time.\\n      Under the action of the central attachment of the vibrometer this\\n      sensitiveness is modified, the sensitiveness to high tones disappearing\\n      and being replaced by a low tone or, conversely, under treatment, a low\\n      tone disappears and a high tone is established, temporarily, at least.\\n      Again, in cases of recent origin, treatment will substitute an undefined\\n      rushing sound for a definite musical tone, either high or low, and later,\\n      the treatment will abolish this, the patient being relieved of this\\n      intensely annoying symptom. In some cases, with this relief, there is an\\n      improvement in the audition; in other cases, no improvement follows.\\n      \\n I confess to the domination of the\\n      material over my mind in my earlier experience with massage, and I think\\n      the inclination of operators will be to use a far greater degree of power\\n      than is necessary. I therefore notice with great satisfaction Professor\\n      Garey\\'s remark that \"the object should be to produce a to-and-fro\\n      motion to the membrana tympani, and, if possible, by a force which is\\n      harmless and at the same time effective.\" I would hardly say\\n      \"to-and-fro motion of the drum-head,\" because I think that the\\n      expression is liable to perpetuate the motion which is fixed in the minds\\n      of most physiologists, that the drum-head moves as a whole, with a\\n      to-and-fro motion.\" That is true under the influence of the Politzer,\\n      Siegle\\'s otoscope and similar instruments; but it certainly does not so\\n      move in the ordinary function of audition, but stands as the iris does in\\n      the eye, as an adjustor, a regulator of sound-force; in some sense as the\\n      iris does in its relation with the lens, to adjust, regulate and direct\\n      the essential force, and the vibration of the drum-head is at every node;\\n      every portion receives impressions that are converted into molecular\\n      disturbances of varying lengths, according as they are produced upon the\\n      stiff and unyielding portions of the drum-head at the periphery, along the\\n      manubrium, or in the more attenuated and easily-yielding portions which\\n      the between these two areas. Not only so, but these impulses are\\n      communicated to the contained air of the tympanum, and make their\\n      impression upon the acoustic nerve through the round window synchronously\\n      with the impression made through the ossicula.\\n      \\n This whole subject widens before my\\n      mind in such a way that one might wish himself twenty years and at liberty\\n      to devote himself to a term of research in acoustics, such as is offered\\n      only in the technical schools of the continent of Europe.\\n      \\n WM. R. KING, M.D.: In discussing Dr.\\n      Garey\\'s paper I shall begin by saying that his methods have been closely\\n      followed by me since the beginning of his experiments, owing to the fact\\n      that I have been greatly interested in the treatment of deafness and\\n      tinnitus by means of sound waves or by aural massage since 1887, and have\\n      experimented and treated many cases by this method since then, though with\\n      crude and unsatisfactory instruments. Since using the vibrometer-which,\\n      after much study and experimentation, is now presented to the profession\\n      in practical shape-I have undoubtedly increased my percentage of good\\n      results.\\n      \\n I don\\'t believe I am over-sanguine or\\n      carried away by interest in this method, and believe I can rightly\\n      appreciate that this does not offer us a panacea or cure-all for auditory\\n      ailments, and hope I may always be ready to see the failures and to strive\\n      to find methods or remedies to reach some of them.\\n      \\n In speaking of the application of the\\n      instrument, I wish to call attention to the central attachment or post foe\\n      vibrations. Dr. Garey has not given it as much attention in the paper as\\n      it deserves. It is very useful as a general means of aural massage,\\n      rougher in nature and more general in application than the strings which\\n      help to make up the instrument. I often use it before applying the\\n      \"similar found\" to a given case, as a species of gymnastics, to\\n      stimulate secretion and motion in the conducting apparatus of the ear,\\n      viz., membrana tympani and ossicles. In most cases-in fact, in all-where\\n      tinnitus is present, I follow this up immediately by the nearest approach\\n      to the similar pitch obtainable.\\n      \\n I agree thoroughly with Dr. Garey, that\\n      the best results are achieved in cases accompanying hypertrophic catarrh,\\n      and that the least benefit is apparent in cases of atrophic nature.\\n      \\n Regarding the method of treatment in\\n      the absence of tinnitus, my experience the does not coincide with that of\\n      the author of the paper entirely; I do not feel that as yet we have any\\n      safe rule to guide us. My method has been to try the numerous sounds and\\n      variations the of until I find the one that seems to give the best\\n      immediate results, or that the patient himself will speak of as very\\n      penetrating and powerful )though not necessarily loud and heavy).\\n      \\n It seems almost impossible at present\\n      to simulate all the qualities of tone as they occur in the ears of those\\n      suffering with tinnitus; in fact, it would appear to be unnecessary.\\n      However, it seems advantageous and quite necessary to secure the closest\\n      simulation of pitch, thus in many cases soon obliterating annoying\\n      tinnitus and improving hearing powers.\\n      \\n The arrangement permitting of the\\n      picking of two strings simultaneously adds decidedly the usefulness of the\\n      instrument, as it increases the range of pitch as well as varying the\\n      quality of tones procurable, thereby decidedly enlarging our field of\\n      application.\\n      \\n The force used for creating the message\\n      or gymnastics of the membrana tympani and the ossicles-viz, vibratory\\n      force or sound- carefully and scientifically applied, is nature\\'s remedy,\\n      because it is adapted by nature, and is the only force which can rightly\\n      or safely be applied to these delicate portions of this complex organ of\\n      hearing.\\n      \\n A startling commentary on this subject\\n      is the array of cases benefited who have been relegated to the shelf by\\n      ancient and modern otology; cases declared unhelpable have been vastly\\n      improved. Pray, make no mistake; I did not say all cases.\\n      \\n It may be interesting to hear the\\n      latest regarding the instrument which was first invented for the\\n      application of this method of aural massage Mr. E.J. Godman, the inventor\\n      and patentee, is constantly on the lookout, and always striving for\\n      improvements to his machine. He has made many that you all know of. Permit\\n      me to report a few so recent they have not yet left the factory.\\n      \\n First.-The machine has been taken from\\n      its case, and is now mounted on a solid stand or table of oak, being set\\n      below the level, or so that the face of the instrument is just level with\\n      the face of the table. This is all supported by rigid, solid metal legs,\\n      which absolutely prevent foreign vibrations.\\n      \\n Second.-The motor has been removed from\\n      its little shelf and relegated below the table. I t can be placed upon a\\n      box on the floor, a shelf against the wall, or, better yet, a shelf\\n      solidly attached to the metal supports of the table. A belt goes up\\n      through an aperture to a wheel on a shaft, the other extremity of which\\n      carries a wheel with a rubber tire (a friction wheel), which in its\\n      revolution, being in contact with a larger flat- surfaced wheel on the\\n      main shaft of the instrument, turns this in harmony with itself. This\\n      arrangement does away with the necessity of shifting the motor each time\\n      you wish to shift the carriage from one string to another- a consummation\\n      to be devoutly thankful for. The removal of the motor from the instrument\\n      as at present attached will recommend itself to all who have used the\\n      vibrometer, a great amount of undesirable jar being thus avoided.\\n      \\n Third.-Ratchet keys capable of very\\n      fine adjustment of tension of strings are now provided for the instrument.\\n      \\n Fourth.-A rheostadt or resistance-coil\\n      is now to be placed beneath the table between the storage battery and the\\n      switch, by this means enabling us to control the speed and number of\\n      revolutions to a nicety.\\n      \\n Other, though comparatively minor,\\n      improvements are being made, and others are contemplated, as, for\\n      instance, the substitution of a roughly corrugated rubber band for the\\n      picker on the wheel, thereby getting rid of the metallic sound of the\\n      picker on the wire strings.\\n      \\n I have experimented with a number of\\n      appliance for the production of the sounds and pitches that I have\\n      required, but I always fall back on the vibrometer, especially as at\\n      present constructed, for satisfactory work and results.\\n      \\n This instrument may be, and probably\\n      is, as yet, in its infancy. It, and the method it applies, can only be\\n      perfected by constant work and experimentation both on the part of the\\n      profession and of the manufacturers. Each improvement we can suggest, if\\n      it only should serve as a means of helping one solitary case, would be\\n      well worth our while.\\n      \\n The experiments being made by different\\n      methods for treating deafness by sound waves is indicative of the interest\\n      the profession has taken in the matter. It is indicative of a lack of\\n      something in our usual armamentarium which is greatly longed for by\\n      patient and doctor; that is, the means for making the deaf hear and for\\n      relieving distressing tinnitus. There has been a dearth in this direction,\\n      and perhaps there still is, but I believe fully that we have in aural\\n      massage by vibratory force a decided acquisition at our hands.\\n      \\n E. H. LINNELL., M.D.: I would simply\\n      like to ask Dr. King how long he uses the instrument, and whether he uses\\n      it according to the deafness.\\n      \\n DR. KING: Yes, decidedly. In an intense\\n      case of deafness I would have to use it a great deal longer. The central\\n      attachment I never carry over three or five minutes, and the whole\\n      treatment I don\\'t think is over carried over twenty or twenty-five minutes\\n      in one case, and usually averages from ten to fifteen.\\n      \\n HAROLD WILSON, M.D.: I have only to\\n      suggest, what I have elsewhere called attention to, the possibility of\\n      another mechanical device for securing vibratory motion. It is well known\\n      that in the make and break of a current of electricity, in the circuit of\\n      which there is a telephone, we get an influence upon the make and break of\\n      the current in the telephone. Now, it is a simple matter with which these\\n      makes and breaks are made as to obtaining any number of vibration that you\\n      wish. You may, by a mechanical device of some rotary motion, if you\\n      choose, make and break the current as rapidly as you please until you have\\n      reached several thousand vibrations a second, or you may even make the\\n      vibrations so slow us to be easily counted. The application of this\\n      suggestion has been put in force in my own practice, more or less, in the\\n      use of the telephone as connected with the induction-coil ordinary\\n      battery. The more intense the current, the more intense the sound. You can\\n      easily see that it is mere question of mechanics to secure these two\\n      sounds-intensity of vibration and rapidity of vibration. I will say,\\n      furthermore, that it has this advantage. There is no noise in the office,\\n      which I think is not altogether true of the vibrometer. I would suggest\\n      that so far as the vibrometer is concerned, if it could be made to be\\n      noiseless to anybody but the patient, it would be a decided improvement.\\n      In that respect the telephone is a decided improvement, because there is\\n      no noise except to the patient, because the noise is right at the ear of\\n      the patient. If I were seeking for a perfected instrument in this line, I\\n      would go outside of the banjo idea. As we have the most perfect writing\\n      machines, which have no connection with the ordinary method of writing,\\n      and sewing machines, which have no connection with sewing by hand, so it\\n      occurs to me that possibly the securing of he vibratory motion upon the\\n      ears might be obtained in a totally different way from that which you get\\n      when you listen to the drum of the guitar or an ordinary musical\\n      instrument, and I would suggest that the make and break of a telephone\\n      open a very fruitful field for mechanical experimentation.\\n      \\n H.C. HOUGHTON, M.D.: In my study of\\n      this subject I made the acquaintance of Mr. Bernhardt, of New York City,\\n      who is a personal friend of Mr. Emil Berliner, the inventor of the Emil\\n      Berliner Telephone, which is the instrument by which the Bell Telephone\\n      Company maintain their monopoly at present. Mr. Berliner is the inventor\\n      of the graphophone, and has, I think, covered this whole matter which Dr.\\n      Wilson has mentioned. As ordinary Bell telephone receiver is put into the\\n      circuit of an ordinary induction machine, and you can use it just as the\\n      English people use the audiometer, and as you remove the coil you modify\\n      the vibrations, which is covered with another disk and a tube, and that\\n      tube covered with a stethoscope tube, which is the same as we use for the\\n      phonograph or vibrometer, and, as Dr. Wilson has suggested, you can modify\\n      the intensity, and of course the whole matter is adjusted by the\\n      attachment of the cord, so that you can have fine vibrations. The\\n      intensity of the vibrations is regulated by the distance to which you\\n      uncover the cord. The only difficulty in the adjustment is that it has\\n      been so severe that it is really uncomfortable, and the noise of the\\n      instrument is reduced to the minimum for office use.\\n      \\n A.B. NORTON, M.D.: I will also add that\\n      in regard to the objection Dr. Wilson makes to the noise, there is no\\n      doubt it is an annoying thing in the office, and in that line I have some\\n      men at work on my suggestion. We are devising another machine, or\\n      instrument, which is to be entirely enclosed in a cabinet, so there will\\n      be no noise whatever in the room if it is made a success. The idea is a\\n      little crude, and I am quite uncertain whether it will amount to anything\\n      or not. Then, in the line of what Dr. King was speaking in regard to Mr.\\n      Goodwin-he called, at New York, to see me last week. I made two little\\n      suggestion to him, which I think would be in line with his advancement.\\n      One is the number of the picks. The present vibrometer has four picks I\\n      suggest the experiment of trying twelve or sixteen picks, which will make\\n      a more continuous sound; it may be of some value. Then, in regard to\\n      regulating the speed of the machine: you regulate that now by a series of\\n      buttons, so as to get three different speeds. We will have a very slight,\\n      intermediate speed, and a very rapid speed. My experience with the\\n      vibrometer is especially favorable. I think the idea is in the right\\n      direction, and it is simply a matter of instrumentation.']\n",

Dietary sources of vitamin C include fruits and vegetables, particularly citrus fruits such as oranges.Severe deficiency of vitamin C causes scurvy. Although rare, scurvy results in severe symptoms and can cause death. People with scurvy are treated with vitamin C and should be under medical supervision.Many uses for vitamin C have been proposed, but evidence of benefit in scientific studies is lacking. In particular, research on asthma, cancer, and diabetes remains inconclusive, and a lack of benefit has been found for the prevention of cataracts or heart disease.The use of vitamin C in the prevention or treatment of colds remains controversial. Extensive research has been conducted. Overall, vitamin C lacked an effect on the development of colds and on cold symptoms. However, the duration of the cold shortened slightly. Notably, people living in extreme circumstances, including soldiers in the subarctic, skiers, and marathon runners, had a 50% decrease in the risk of developing a cold. This area merits additional research and may be of particular interest to athletes or people in the military.'\n",

Acid in the stomach releases B12 from protein during digestion. Once released, B12 combines with a substance called intrinsic factor (IF) before it is absorbed into the bloodstream.The human body stores several years\\' worth of vitamin B12 in the liver, so low levels in the body are rare. Decreases in vitamin B12 levels are more common in the elderly, HIV-infected persons, and vegetarians.

First of all, radium and x-rays are no\\n      longer looked on a last resort.\".\\n      \\n The foregoing bears witness to the\\n      progress made in the field radiation therapy. The manufacture of more\\n      adequate apparatus and the improved technic in its use reflect this\\n      improvement. Machines are used generally delivering twenty to thirty\\n      milliamperes of current at 200 K.V., while machines operating at 750 to\\n      1,000 200 K.V., using lower milliamperes, have been installed in several\\n      places in this country. Since the question of increased voltages began to\\n      dominate the field, machines operating at 400 to 600 K.V., using sealed\\n      tubes, have been manufactured in this country as well as on the been\\n      manufactured in this country as well as on the continent. This higher\\n      powered machines occupy little more space than the usual 200 K.V. machine.\\n      \\n The effectiveness of these stronger\\n      radiations is thought to be due to (1) the increased penetration and its\\n      consequently larger percentage depth doses, (2) the supposed higher\\n      selective action of short have length radiation on malignant cells, and\\n      (3) greatly increased x-ray output. Clinics using super-voltages report\\n      that clinical results are somewhat better than those secured through the\\n      use of the lesser voltage machine.\\n      \\n Experimental effort, from the physical\\n      and biologic point of view, has been exerted to establish to standard\\n      basis for radiotherapy since Roentgens discovery thirtyfive years ago, and\\n      its application five years later. Radiotherapists have only recently begun\\n      to understand the principles of clinical application or radiotherapy in\\n      the treatment of malignant conditions.\\n      \\n Regaud selected the rabbits testicle\\n      for his experiments because its histologic cellular structure was highly\\n      sensitive to radiation, containing cells which are in a state of active\\n      mitosis resembling that of malignant tissue. In 1922, Regaud reported that\\n      of malignant, tissue. In 1922, Regaud reported that it was impossible to\\n      sterilize the testicle by a single dose of radiation without causing\\n      serious damage to the overlying skin. The dose required to produced such\\n      radio necrosis was equivalent to about three radionecrosis was equivalent\\n      to about three erythemas when administered in one dose. However, by\\n      dividing the dose in such a manner as to prolong the treatment over a\\n      period of fourteen days, a total dose of about five erythemas could be\\n      given causing complete sterilizations without damage to the skin. Thus it\\n      is seen that by prolonging the time of treatment the cutaneous dose could\\n      be increased nearly 50 per cent without causing necrosis.\\n      \\n The above experiments were reported,\\n      and the same results determined, by Schinz and Slotopolsky in 1926, and\\n      again by Regaud and Ferroux in 1927. These experiments formed the\\n      foundation for the clinical studies of Pfahler (America), Hohlfelder\\n      (Germany) and Coutard (France), who have swung the pendulum from massive\\n      radiation, as advocated by the German school, to that of the protected\\n      fractional dose method. Results have been achieved by this method which\\n      are superior to previously reported; these are obtained by the improved\\n      method of administering a large dose to the (3 days) without causing\\n      destructive effects to the surroundings normal structure (or cancer bed);\\n      its effect are rather biologic than physical. The clinical application of\\n      the method of radiation by Pfahler, Countard, and Berven (Sweden) in the\\n      treatment of cancer of the tonsil, pharynx and larynx and have proved the\\n      radio-sensitive properties of squamous carcinoma, previously considered\\n      incapable of of responding to radiation.\\n      \\n According to Coutard, the neoplasm is\\n      exposed to x-rays twice daily, giving a total dose of 350 r to400 r to two\\n      areas, using 190 to 200 k.v., four milliamperes, two millimeters of copper\\n      and three millimeters of aluminum filtration at a distance of fifty of\\n      sixty centimeters, for lesion of the head and neck. For deeply situated\\n      lesions, such as cancer of the uterus, the focal distance varies from 80\\n      to 100 centimeters, the area of the field for the head and neck conditions\\n      being only 50 to 100 square centimeters, while those of the lower abdomen\\n      require on an average of 250 to 300 square centimeters. For the\\n      sterilization of the radio-sensitive squamous carcinomatous growth, a\\n      depth dose of 3,000 r to 4,000 r is given, while stronger dose is\\n      necessary for the radio-resistant tumors.\\n      \\n In the course of treatment of principle\\n      guides a radio reaction of the covering epithelium and the radio reaction\\n      of the cancer cells. The radio reaction of the cutaneous epithelium is\\n      called \"radio epidermitis.\"characterized by loss of epithelial\\n      layers and denudation of the dermis. The reaction of the mucous membrane ,\\n      called \"radio epithelitis,\" manifests itself by loss of the\\n      epithelial layer sand denudation of the mucous membrane, epithelial layers\\n      and denudation of the corium which becomes covered by a fibrinous and\\n      false membrane; of clear. The duration of both describe radio reactions is\\n      six weeks. Each appears at the beginning of three weeks and disappears at\\n      the beginning of the ninth week.\\n      \\n Should the total or daily dose or the\\n      intensity per minute be too high, or the filtration or the tension too\\n      low, the cancer bed would be modified. the nutrition of the malignant\\n      cells becomes impaired The cellular radio- sensitivity, which seems to be\\n      linked up not only with the mitosis of the cell but above all with the\\n      activity of their interchange with the cell but above all with the\\n      activity of their interchange with the surrounding normal structures,\\n      becomes diminished and at times suppressed. The cancer cells become\\n      incentive to radiation. This phenomenon is called \"radio-\\n      vaccination\" by Regaud.\\n      \\n Observation of clinical facts shows\\n      that changes in the surrounding normal tissue result from excessive daily\\n      doses and intensity per minute per minute causing radio resistance of the\\n      tissue. Conversely, radio- sensitivity would be prolonged with a smaller\\n      daily dosage and the resultant extended period.\\n      \\n Realizing that better results may be\\n      obtained by prolonged treatment, Coutard and his collaborators in the last\\n      few years have begun to extend the duration of treatment of certain\\n      so-called radio-resistant cancers from thirty to ninety days, giving weak\\n      daily doses in order of about 175, 220, 225 and 250 r per day, dividing\\n      the dose in two treatments. By this method he was able to cure a certain\\n      number of lesions on which he had not been able previously to obtain the\\n      same results, such as very differentiated epidermoid epithelioma invading\\n      the muscles and cartilages, glandular epithelioma of the breast ad the\\n      thyroid body, and special round celled epitheliomas of the upper part of\\n      the ethmoid and the adjacent sinuses. This mode of prolonged treatment not\\n      only controlled the condition locally but it lessened the frequency of\\n      metastasis.\\n      \\n When radiating a cancer of very\\n      embryonic, very radio-sensitive growths, the energy factor is predominant.\\n      The action of the x-rays seems to be direct and rapid; the treatment can\\n      be accomplished within fifteen to twenty days. The cells are destroyed and\\n      generally normal structures are affected very little. When radiating the\\n      less embryonic type of growths, the time of treatment should be longer.\\n      \\n Pursuing these general principles, I\\n      have adopted the Countard method with some slight modifications. The cures\\n      which I shall illustrate will show that the percentage of cures in a\\n      number of most dangerous epidermoid carcinomas has markedly increased and\\n      that some conditions formerly considered hopeless have been temporarily\\n      cured. In conclusion I wish to emphasize the following facts:.\\n      \\n (1) Cure of cancer by x-rays is still\\n      difficult and must not be entered into lightly and causally.\\n      \\n (2) Radiotherapy is just as radical in\\n      method as surgery, and requires great skill, judgment and experience.\\n      \\n (3) The cooperation of the pathologist\\n      and the radiotherapist is imperative for a proper estimate of the\\n      radio-sensitivity in relation to treatment of the lesion.\\n      \\n (4) Daily examination of the patient is\\n      necessary; modification of the normal structure and general reaction by\\n      the x-ray treatment sometimes appears to quickly that it is often\\n      necessary to diminish the daily dose or the size of the field in the\\n      course of treatment.\\n      \\n (5) There exists no fixed method of\\n      treatment, only a simple clinical treatment for each individual patient\\n      and for the special type of tumor..\\n      \\n (6) Improvement in roentgen apparatus\\n      of higher voltages, producing more penetrating rays, will permit a better\\n      relation between destruction of malignant cells and preservation of the\\n      supporting, and the radio sensitivity of the tumor may be prolonged.'\n",
      " 'Tresorie - ALL INDIA HOMOEOPATHIC CONVENTION WELCOME ADDRESS [All India\\nHomoeopathic Convention Welcome Address]\\n\\n Mr. President, Friends and Colleagues.\\n      \\n It fills my heart with joy unspeakable\\n      to extend a hearty welcome to you all to this city at this All India\\n      Homoeopathic Convention held on the occasion of Bi-centennial Birth-day\\n      Anniversary of our great Master Hahnemann. This is the city where\\n      Homoeopathy was first introduced by Rajendra Lal Dutta of hallowed memory,\\n      who spent a princely fortune for dissemination of its principles and\\n      practice among his countrymen. This is the city where took place the\\n      dramatic conversion of one of the then medical luminaries of the first\\n      magnitude, to the practice of Homoeopathy under the influence of Rajendra\\n      Lal. I mean Dr. Mahendra Lal Sircar who became the high priest of\\n      Homoeopathy, spread its glory far and wide and gained thereby an\\n      international reputation for himself. This is the city where the\\n      celebrities of Homoeopathy like Dr. Berigny, Dr. Salzar, Dr. P.C.\\n      Majumdar, Dr. D. N. Roy. Dr. Younan, Dr. J.N. Majumdar, Dr. Baridbaran\\n      Mukherji, Dr. S.K. Nag, Dr. A.N. Mukherji, Dr. T.N. Palit, Dr. G.\\n      Dirghangi and a host of other talented physicians practised their\\n      profession with credit and success and held aloft the banner of\\n      Homoeopathy. This is the city where exist pioneer institutions for the\\n      teaching of Homoeopathy. This is the city wherefrom Homoeopathy has spread\\n      to all parts of India and its votaries are doing yeomans service for the\\n      good of the suffering humanity.\\n      \\n We are meeting this evening on a\\n      historic occasion and we have to arrive at decisions which might make or\\n      mar the future history of Homoeopathy in India. It may be that forces of\\n      disruption, destruction and obstruction are at work; it may be that self\\n      and vested interests seem to thwart the smooth progress of Homoeopathy; it\\n      may be that some may seem to play in the hands of the Powers that are not\\n      too sympathetic to the cause of Homoeopathy; it may be that the present\\n      seems to be chaotic and future of Homoeopathy dubious but great is truth\\n      indeed and will prevail. We should not lose heart or throw up the sponge.\\n      Tradition, authority, sectarianism, dogmatism are great obstacles on the\\n      way. But obstacles and difficulties are meant to be fought out and\\n      overcome. Strifes and dissensions, discords and disunities may hamper our\\n      progress but they are nonetheless signs of lifes activities. It is a good\\n      augury that the Homoeopathic profession is shaking off its age - long\\n      slumber and getting more and more conscious of its duties and obligation,\\n      its rights and privileges and of its short - comings and practical\\n      difficulties. The life of Hahnemann is there to encourage us; the\\n      masterful will of his dynamic spirit is there to inspire us to intensify\\n      our activities; his achievements are there to goad us to realise greater\\n      success; and his personality is always before us to take lessons from, in\\n      our life which as Swami Vivekananda puts it, is \"a process of\\n      unfolding and development of a being under circumstances tending to press\\n      it down.\"\\n      \\n That Homoeopathy is a scientific system\\n      of treatment, philosophically sound, logically unimpeachable, practically\\n      highly efficacious in curing the sick and cheap enough to suit the poor\\n      economic condition of the Indian masses - has become a much talked - of\\n      subject in the country. But why is it not spreading sufficiently and\\n      adequately in our motherland or in fact anywhere in the world? Why is our\\n      National Government not still keen on according official recognition to\\n      this superb system of healing art or providing ways and means for its\\n      development and diffusion? Why the public opinion is not gaining strength\\n      enough to put sufficient pressure on our Government to take interest in\\n      it? Why sufficient number of fully equipped Homoeopathic teaching\\n      institutions and hospitals are not growing to turn out adequate number of\\n      fully qualified Homoeopathic physicians in the country?\\n      \\n It is high time that we should draw the\\n      attention of the profession and the laity to provide answers to so many\\n      \"whys\" and to solve the pressing problems in the matter\\n      concerned. On a cursory view it becomes evident that the Homoeopathic\\n      profession, the people and the Government are each individually and\\n      collectively responsible for this impasse.\\n      \\n The so - called Allopathy still\\n      occupies the dominant place in any country, even in the land of birth of\\n      Homoeopathy. It is no wonder that Homoeopathy, being a discovery of merely\\n      a century and a half still lags behind its rival shool. But it is a wonder\\n      of wonders that Homoeopathy has already encompassed the whole world within\\n      such a short period since it was ushered into existence by Hahnemann.\\n      History of man reveals that nowhere a new truth was accepted by him easily\\n      and readily, obsessed as he is with conservatism, tradition, authority and\\n      vested interests. Nonetheless the triumphant march of Homoeopathy with a\\n      such a meteoric speed throughout the length and breadth of the world is a\\n      proof positive of the truth inherent in the system and phenomenal\\n      therapeutic efficacy of this healing art. It is one more glaring instance\\n      of mans love of truth against heavy odds that impede his progress at every\\n      step.\\n      \\n For the propagation of any new truth\\n      and its acceptance by man, in general, the first and foremost condition is\\n      the turning out of sufficient number of persons who have realised the\\n      truth and are adept in the practice of it. This involves establishment of\\n      a sufficient number of teaching institutions which will turn out experts\\n      in the science and art of Homoeopathy; and a sufficient number of\\n      Homoeopathic Hospital where, the efficacy of this system of treatment will\\n      be put to test.\\n      \\n Human knowledge is becoming\\n      unmanageably vast. The appearance of specialists has become indispensable.\\n      So special Hospitals for the treatment of specific types of diseases have\\n      sprung forth elsewhere, e.g. Tuberculosis Hospitals, Cancer Hospitals,\\n      Hospital for Tropical Diseases etc. Because of organisation of these\\n      hospitals people generally think of getting themselves treated in these\\n      institutions. As there are no fully - equipped general Homoeopathic\\n      Hospitals and not to speak of special Homoeopathic Hospitals and not to\\n      speak of special Homoeopathic Hospitals the result is Homoeopathy is not\\n      getting a fair chance of treating those diseases like tuberculosis,\\n      cancer, acute infectious diseases of epidemic type e.g., Small-pox,\\n      Cholera etc. on a large and organised scale. Consequently the general\\n      public cannot keep much faith in this treatment and mostly take recourse\\n      to homoeopathic treatment when the case is \"past all hope and past\\n      all surgery\". Hence the establishment of fully - equipped\\n      Homoeopathic institutions (College - cum - Hospitals) is an imperative\\n      necessity for enhancing the prestige of the Homoeopathic profession and\\n      for convincing the people about the therapeutic efficacy of this system of\\n      treatment. Is it not a pity that Homoeopathy once established its\\n      reputation by treating Cholera cases in this city and now nobody thinks of\\n      this treatment in Cholera cases and rushes the patient to the Allopathic\\n      Hospitals which are especially meant for these types of patients? How can\\n      we hope to gain ground under these circumstances?\\n      \\n The next great obstacle is the apathy\\n      and in many cases active antagonism of our Government, both at the Centre\\n      and at least in some of the State, towards Homoeopathy. The Government is\\n      under the thumb of its medical directorates which are solely manned by\\n      Allopathic doctors. The main reasons for the non - acceptance of the\\n      Homoeopathic system of treatment may be summed up in three words:\\n      tradition, authority and professionalism. Their psychology is easily\\n      understood if it is borne in mind that the conservative inertia of human\\n      mind attempts to reject any new thought will all the means at its\\n      disposal. Another reason is due to vested interests. Even a cursory glance\\n      at the history of origin and spread of Homoeopathy, enables one to find\\n      out that the opposition to this system from the start, was not scientific\\n      but rather of commercial nature on the part of the apothecaries who were\\n      afraid of losing their trade - profits. We regret to note that the Central\\n      Government have not yet implemented a single recommendation put forward by\\n      the Homoeopathic Enquiry Committee, Planning Commission. Third Health\\n      Ministers Conference, Ad Hoc Committee etc. though Homoeopathic Acts have\\n      been passed in the States of Bombay, U.P., Madhya Pradesh, Travancore -\\n      Cochin, Bihar etc. I is curious to note that W. Bengal is the only State\\n      where a Homoeopathic Bill has recently been thrown out by the State\\n      Government.\\n      \\n Another great obstacle is the\\n      psychology of the general mass of population who fail to adopt a proper\\n      philosophical attitude towards Homoeopathy and takes the Homoeopathic\\n      Therapeutic Law as great paradox contrary to common sense. Unless we can\\n      educate the public in the matter, we cannot hope to secure their whole -\\n      hearted support for this system of treatment.\\n      \\n Lack of enthusiasm for constructive\\n      works on the part of the Homoeopathic profession, the apathy of our\\n      Government and hesitancy on the part of the public to accept Homoeopathy\\n      are great obstacles to the spread of this system of treatment in the\\n      country. Unless this vicious circles is broken the progress of Homoeopathy\\n      is bound to be impeded. We have to fight on all fronts if we aspire to\\n      achieve victory in our battle for the cause of Homoeopathy and the\\n      suffering humanity.\\n      \\n But our first necessity as pointed out\\n      by the Soul of India expressing itself through Sri Aurobindo, is: If India\\n      is to survive and do her appointed work in the world, the youth of India\\n      should learn to think, to think on all subjects, to think independently,\\n      fruitfully, going to the heart of things, not stopped by their surface,\\n      free of pre - judgements, shearing sophism and prejudice asunder as with a\\n      sharp sword smiting down obscurantism of all kinds as with a mace of\\n      Bhima.\\n      \\n \"Let our brains no longer, like\\n      European infants, be swathed with swaddling clothes; let it have recover\\n      the free and unbound motion of the Gods, let it have not only the\\n      minuteness but the wide mastery and sovereignty natural to the intellect\\n      of Bharata and easily recoverable by it if it once accustomes itself to\\n      feel its own power and be convinced of its own worth.\\n      \\n \"The old fixed foundations have\\n      been broken up, we are tossing in the waters of a great upheaval and\\n      change. It is no use clinging to the old ice - floes of the past, they\\n      will soon melt and leave their refugees struggling in perilous waters. It\\n      is no use landing ourselves in the infirm bog, neither sea nor good, dry\\n      land of a second - hand Europeanism. We shall only die there a miserable\\n      and unclean death.\\n      \\n \"No we must learn to swim and use\\n      that power to reach the good vessel of unchanging truth; we must land\\n      again on the eternal rock of ages.\"\\n      \\n Yes, we must expand, we must assimilate\\n      whatever is assimilable for our growth. Stagnation and contraction are the\\n      signs of Death. Our knowledge must be aggressive, must diffuse through the\\n      rank and file of the whole Homoeopathic profession if we wish to survive\\n      and perpetuate ourselves; to leave an extensive ignorance either below or\\n      around us is to expose ourselves to the perpetual danger of being\\n      exterminated as a professional entity.\\n      \\n In fine, I welcome you, once again, on\\n      this historic occasion to this historic city to deliberate, to exchange\\n      view points and to come to agreed decisions with regard to our future line\\n      of action in respect of Homoeopathy in all its aspects.'\n",
      " 'Tresorie - SOME OBSERVATIONS ON NEURASTHENIA AND ITS TREATMENT\\n[Neurasthenia & Treatment]\\n\\n WHEN, thirty-five years ago, the writer\\n      first made the acquaintance of what is now called neurasthenia, it was\\n      known as spinal irritation, and the best of modern researches have been\\n      unable to give a better definition beyond a functional disturbance of the\\n      spinal and cerebral nerves, dependent on a morbid process, for which\\n      \"irritation\" is as proper a term as any. As deaths do not occur,\\n      autopsies throw no light on the subject. Briefly stated, neurasthenia,\\n      when observed from the beginning through its chronic course, has a period\\n      of prodromal symptoms followed by a protracted acute, and succeeded by a\\n      still more protracted chronic, state, between the end of which and the\\n      beginning of convalescence there is a very vague, often indiscernible,\\n      boundary line.\\n      \\n The prodromal symptoms are quite\\n      indefinite and very variable, pointing to nothing in particular. Loss of\\n      appetite, irregular sleep, excitability alternating with lassitude, etc.,\\n      are often overlooked, especially when the second stage-display of unusual\\n      mental and physical energy without subsequent fatigue- becomes apparent.\\n      This is often mistaken for a sign of unusually good health. When a young\\n      girl or mature woman, married or unmarried, feels that she can study ten\\n      hours a day and devote half of her night to pleasure or business; when\\n      besides much mental occupation she begins to rejoice in long walks without\\n      fatigue, that is the time when the mischief is going on without exciting\\n      timely suspicion. Relief is at last sought when the functional disorder of\\n      the nerves has gone to the opposite extreme, and becomes manifest in what\\n      is properly and popularly termed \"nervous prostration,\" when\\n      instead of having no sense of fatigue, the best bodily or mental effort\\n      seems intolerable, in grave cases rendering the patient a helpless being,\\n      completely dependent on the unremitting assistance of others whom she )it\\n      is usually a woman) rules with the inexorable power of the vis inertiae.\\n      \\n During this usually very protracted\\n      period of the disease convalescence usually sets in, but so imperceptibly\\n      that the physician alone can sometimes estimate its progress, which is\\n      unnoticeable to others towards whom the patient acts as she has for months\\n      or years. This is the time for action, too often delayed from motives of\\n      misplaced sympathy on the part of relatives and friends.\\n      \\n The affections is in many instances\\n      limited to the spine, the mind becoming only secondarily tired. In other\\n      cases it is spinal and cerebral; in others again chiefly cerebral. The\\n      line between this and insanity is always clearly definable. Though a\\n      neurasthenic patient may become insane, and probably the reverse, yet both\\n      are distinct conditions.\\n      \\n Books speak of this disease at common\\n      to men and women. Yet in this region in small towns as well as in large\\n      cities the cases of neurasthenia in women are preponderatingly great.\\n      \\n Hypochondriacs and hysteria stand in\\n      peculiar relation to neurasthenia. They maybe regarded as different\\n      species of the same genus; that is, more or less deeply seated\\n      disturbances of the cerebro-spinal system in which the sympathetic system\\n      is probably indirectly involved, as many functional disturbances presided\\n      over by the great sympathetic system often testify. Hypochondriasis, pure\\n      and simple as occurring in men, is easily distinguishable by its striking\\n      characteristic of introspection and despondency, occasioned by abnormal\\n      sensations, without marked physical weakness and tiredness. Pure\\n      hypochondriacs are often energetic, conscientious workers. In hysteria\\n      there is neither great tiredness nor tendency to introspection, but a\\n      paroxysmal or prolonged absence of the power of self control, in grave\\n      cases associated with tonic or clonic muscular spasm and loss of\\n      consciousness. While neurasthenia in its uncomplicated forms is free from\\n      these symptoms, but, as ample experience teaches, often complicated with\\n      both of the preceding forms to such an extent that it is often very\\n      difficult to tell which is primary and which secondary. The symptoms known\\n      as introspection, hysterical aberrations of the emotions, and neurasthenic\\n      sense of exhaustion are in their distinctive manifestations most important\\n      and constitute indications in the selection of remedial and dietetic\\n      measures.\\n      \\n The following are some observation of\\n      peculiarities observed in a large number of cases and peculiar to all:.\\n      \\n Introspection.-The neurasthenic patient\\n      in variably expresses her desire for relief, not so much in a direct\\n      appeal as in a supplicating, subdued tone of voice and manner. She rarely\\n      asks, \"What can you do to relieve me?\" but almost invariably,\\n      \"What is the cause of\" this or that sensation? If she is\\n      introspective, that is, hypochondriacal, she becomes a nosomaniac,\\n      watching acutely every one of her numerous distressing sensation, on the\\n      unremitting analysis of which her mind dwells. In marked cases she is\\n      quite unable to think of anything outside of herself, and in many cases\\n      dislikes to do so, preferring to river her attention on herself. Attempts\\n      to divert her annoy or anger her. Friends and relatives implore the\\n      physician to divert the patient, but all their attempts are in vain\\n      because quite misdirected.\\n      \\n Positive and Negative Will.-It seems\\n      sometimes as if the patient delights in her self-inspection, and that she\\n      prefers her condition to speedy recovery. This is not the case, for the\\n      patient will always assure the physician of her wish to get well. During\\n      the acute stage-a long yet definable period-this wish and longing cannot\\n      well be utilized, but the long and ill-defined period of convalescence\\n      must first be awaited. Here we shall always discover that the wish and the\\n      will of the patient are two very different mental conditions. The desire\\n      or wish for recovery is entirely unattended by any will effort to\\n      accomplish the desired end. The injunctions and directions of the\\n      physician are resisted by the same unconquerable power of negative power,\\n      or vis inertiae. The patient having been unable to exert her will, now\\n      thinks herself unable to use it.\\n      \\n Numerous Symptoms of Patients.-To\\n      physicians in search of indications for medicines each statement of\\n      patient concerning a sensation is apt to be considered as a symptom. Many\\n      years ago, when resolved to get at the keynote of a patient\\'s case, the\\n      writer determined to allow the patient to detail all her symptoms as long\\n      as she chose and to take accurate notes of each one till the right one\\n      should be disclosed; and this was to be done regardless of time and\\n      exertion. The patient, one who needed no urging to describe her\\n      \"symptoms,\" began in an almost inaudible voice, detailing one\\n      sensation after another with an unrivalled degree of clearness and\\n      vividness of expression; as she proceeded the voice became stronger, her\\n      face slightly flushed, and the most perfect descriptive language flowed in\\n      an endless stream. Each word was written down, page after page was filled;\\n      still she went on with unmistakable signs of satisfaction at being able to\\n      pour her pent-up emotions into willing and sympathetic ears. If, for a\\n      moment, the flow of language was interrupted, a simple question would\\n      re-animate her to proceed with renewed energy. Feelings seemed to beget\\n      feelings; their complexity gave the patient no trouble; her intellect was\\n      equal to the action of unraveling the most complicated sensation,\\n      separating them into their component parts and spreading them out before\\n      the mind of the listener. A glance at the watch showed that nearly two\\n      hours had passed, during which the feeblest of neurasthenic patients had\\n      talked incessantly. The note-book was full, the keynote was found. It was\\n      this: neurasthenic patients have innumerable sensation and exhibit no\\n      sings of fatigue after talking incessantly for nearly two hours.\\n      \\n Great Endurance of Neurasthenics.-The\\n      instance just related, which is one of many, illustrates two things. One\\n      is, that it is not the kind of sensation described but the fact that\\n      neurasthenics have innumerable sensations, that constitute the symptoms.\\n      The other thing is that many neurasthenics are capable of great exertion\\n      without suffering disagreeable after- effects from fatigue. This is\\n      illustrated by other cases of which I have notes. A highly neurasthenic\\n      young lady consented to camp out for her health near a lake. She was\\n      induced to join a party for a short walk along the lake. By trying what\\n      they thought a shorter road the party lost their way and took a very long\\n      walk of about four hours, through bogs and over forces. The neurasthenic\\n      was less fatigued than some of the others. The interesting observation was\\n      subsequently made that the patient had become interested in a young man of\\n      the party. She recovered her health within a year from that time. Other\\n      cases of this kind will appear under the head of therapeutic suggestions.\\n      \\n Neurasthenic Patients Crave\\n      Sympathy.-This is one of the most formidable obstacles to the curative\\n      management of such cases, for the kind of sympathy such patients crave is\\n      expressions of condolence and more or less deep affliction at so much\\n      suffering as the patient expresses. Such sympathy is most natural and does\\n      honor to the feelings of parents, sisters, brothers and husbands, but it\\n      is unfortunate that the deeper their expression of affliction so much the\\n      more profound will be the mental dejection and weakness of the patient.\\n      Almost every case which has come under the writer\\'s observation has been\\n      much hampered if not made hopeless by this condition of things, against\\n      which no remedy suggests itself that would not be construed as\\n      \"unkind\".\\n      \\n The origin of this very formidable and\\n      refractory nervous disease, like that of most diseases usually termed\\n      chronic, is either hereditary or acquired, as the histories of every\\n      observed case plainly testify. Either the father was a hypochondriac or\\n      the mother neurasthenic, or both parents were of unsound nervous\\n      constitution. Dipsomania on the part of parents produces neurasthenia in\\n      the children, as readily as it will be followed by any other form of\\n      nervous disease, according to the individual predisposition of the\\n      offspring. The excessive use of tea and coffee is another very active\\n      factor in the history of neurasthenics. Where fathers inclined to alcohol,\\n      mothers are addicted to tea and coffee, which, while its immediate effects\\n      do not obtrude themselves upon our notice, are none the less insidious in\\n      their more remote consequences.\\n      \\n The acquired forms of neurasthenia are\\n      of utmost interest to the therapeutist, and the sources of acquisition are\\n      readily stated. They are much brain-work with insufficient food and sleep.\\n      Such conditions obtain chiefly in women (less frequently in men) of fine\\n      intellectual ability, conscientiousness and ambition. Physical overwork\\n      with unintellectual women has no such effect. Quite analogous to the above\\n      are the conditions of care and sorrow, especially in women who are able\\n      for a long time to conceal and control their emotions. The usual\\n      consequence of such states of mind is disregard of food and insufficient\\n      sleep. Instances of acquired neurasthenia are presented in families of\\n      several girls and boys, where one or more of the former are Neurasthenic\\n      while the latter are vigorous and athletic. Boys delighting in vigorous\\n      exercise do not, as is the case with girls, lose appetite and sleep.\\n      \\n The effects of nervous exhaustion in\\n      boys are usually much less grave than in girls; as a rule such effects are\\n      manifested in mental, not muscular, tiredness, and they are relieved by\\n      air and exercise, while in girls and women those influences are shunned\\n      because they seem to increase the tiredness.\\n      \\n Predisposition-The temperament, or what\\n      in modern pharaseology is called the personal equation, plays a visible\\n      but uncontrollable part in the progress of neurasthenia, as temperament\\n      greatly determines the other imperfectly known condition known as\\n      predisposition. Where the disease is hereditary, it is easy to say that\\n      the predisposition is due to that source; where there is no history of\\n      heredity and where neurasthenia exists in the last members of a\\n      generation, it may be attributed to acquired predisposition which needed\\n      only the exciting cause to establish the disease in its most typical form.\\n      \\n One of the most common forms of\\n      neurasthenia, often quite intractable, results from a serious defect in\\n      our public school system, one which affects chiefly girls from twelve to\\n      fourteen years of age. The following is a brief example: The child rises\\n      late with no appetite for breakfast and no time to eat it if so inclined.\\n      The lessons, however, have been learned the evening before, and the school\\n      work is begun with an ambitions will and a crammed mind, and continues\\n      with one intermission of often not more than ten minutes or three of four\\n      hours. The pupil arrives at home ravenously hungry, eats too fast, and too\\n      much of injudiciously prepared food, too long in digesting to leave room\\n      for an appetite for even a light evening meal, or even for a breakfast the\\n      next morning.\\n      \\n In another case the girl or boy grows\\n      desperately hungry while at school, but being unprovided with food\\n      (lunch), goes on with the school exercises, at the end of which the sense\\n      of hunger has vanished and has been replaced by an aversion to normal\\n      food, with a possible craving for something pungent and indigestible. This\\n      observation can easily be made in many instances, and will, in as many\\n      cases, be seen to lead to nervous prostration, which is then treated by\\n      vile, patented concoctions consisting largely of whiskey, under the name\\n      of \"tonics,\" while the patient needs only the best that a\\n      legitimate market affords prepared in a sensible manner.\\n      \\n Typical Cases Ending in Rapid\\n      Recovery.-Curative results have already been indicated in what has been\\n      said above, and further indications for treatment may be gathered from a\\n      few cases of extremely rapid recovery of apparently incurable cases, to\\n      which brief allusion will here be made. A woman of forty had been a victim\\n      of grave neurasthenia for five years. In the absence of an inclination to\\n      exert himself, she had, during that period, been mostly confined to her\\n      bed or lounge, in the meantime giving birth to two children, going through\\n      gestation and confinement normally, without recovering from neurasthenic\\n      prostration which, in the course of some years more, rendered her entirely\\n      helpless. Her condition was associated with a feeling of dropping to\\n      pieces unless supported and braced by a harness of wood, iron and leather,\\n      in which she \"sat up\" for several hours each day, spending the\\n      rest of the time in bed. Having left the patient in this condition, it was\\n      reported before the writer\\'s next professional visit that Mrs.-had been\\n      cured, and that she was able to go out like other people. A visit to the\\n      house confirmed the report. The patient came to the door herself, and in a\\n      quiet manner, entirely without the least expression of joy or wonder at\\n      her release, stated, that having heard of a famous \"magnetic\\n      physician,\" she summoned him, was ordered by him to arise and stand;\\n      protesting that it was impossible, she was raised to her feet and again\\n      ordered to stand, then to walk. Fearing that she would fall, she begged\\n      the magnetic doctor to support her, which he peremptorily refused, saying\\n      she might fall if she liked. Instead of falling, she had to walk about the\\n      room, was then placed upon a lounge and subjected to a severe treatment of\\n      rolling and pummelling, and then ordered to dress and sit up until tired,\\n      to remain up and about like other people, and to call on the doctor in\\n      future, as he would not come so far to the patient again. This happened\\n      about twenty-five years ago, and the patient has been in very fair health\\n      arrested by insisting that all professional visits by the writer or any\\n      other physician to whose sympathy the patient could appeal must cease.\\n      This injunction was carried out conscientiously with the best results by\\n      the husband of the patient. Perhaps we may learn from this that sometimes,\\n      at least, the familiar motto is reversed, and angels rush in where fools\\n      fear to tread.\\n      \\n Profiting by this experience, another\\n      neurasthenic woman, unmarried, but of most intractable, antagonistic\\n      temperament, confined to her bed, in and out of hospitals, for years,\\n      wearing out the strength and means of her relatives and the patience of\\n      many physicians, was at length abandoned by them. It was a case of spinal\\n      and cerebral neurasthenia complicated with hypochondriasis in its most\\n      trying form of introspective maunderings and endless description of\\n      symptoms. She tormented her advisers by her endless tirades, the\\n      indulgence of which invariably aggravated her condition, and were there\\n      fore avoided, until once her physician yielded to the patient\\'s\\n      importunities for a visit, when be found her in her usual abject state of\\n      prostration. Guided by experience derived from cases like the one first\\n      described, he assisted the patient to her feet and marched her, will you\\n      nil you, up and down the room until he, at least, was thoroughly tired,\\n      and then departed with the promise never to do so again. The patient, on\\n      her part, made a number of her unnameable promises, but kept on her feet\\n      and let the doctors alone. Though not cured of deeply-rooted morbid mental\\n      faults, the neurasthenic phase of her condition had yielded to the change\\n      of the antagonistic element of her character from passive to very\\n      practical activity. A third very serious case of this kind occurred in the\\n      person of a girl of fifteen, of selfish character, who gradually became\\n      bed-ridden with spinal and cerebral neurasthenia, and tormented with the\\n      usual multifarious painful sensations, none of which, on the most\\n      pains-taking physical examination, resulted from demonstrable organic\\n      disease of genital or abdominal organs. The patient was most tenderly\\n      cared for by her mother, who, in the course of years, became so imbued\\n      with the idea of yielding to every wish and whim of the patient, that at\\n      length remonstrance became useless. The mother, though recognizing the\\n      importance of persuading or urging her daughter to depend more on herself,\\n      admitted that she had yielded so long that now she must continue to feed,\\n      dress and assist her charge in the most trivial things. Her food had to be\\n      placed in her mouth, the position of a hand or foot changed by some one\\n      else, although patient did so spontaneously when she chose. This went on\\n      for fifteen years, when the mother, growing old and feeble, died. Her\\n      maternal support being gone, the patient at once proved her ability to\\n      walk, to dress, to feed herself, and to seek light employment. Though far\\n      from well, she is equally far fro being a helpless, bed-ridden invalid.\\n      \\n A fourth case, still very vividly\\n      impressed on the writer\\'s mind, was one of a healthy, romping girl of 14,\\n      who, as happen in this remarkably capricious disease, in the midst of\\n      perfect health, one day took to her bed and remained there with all the\\n      symptoms of neurasthenia, involving first the spinal and finally the\\n      cerebral nerves. This patient was very amiable, conscientious, and\\n      sensible, never loquacious, and not troubled with hypochondriacal thoughts\\n      or sensations. Tiredness was the only expression she used in describing\\n      her feelings. There was literally no variation from this condition, which\\n      confined her to her bed for years, till she grew from a girl to a woman.\\n      Eating and sleeping well, and improving perceptibly in personal appearance\\n      and character, yet she lay on her couch tired and watched over with\\n      unremitting care by a most anxious mother, showing her solicitude and\\n      sympathy in every feature. Once, in the second year of the disease, a\\n      favorable interruption occurred. The mother, still a young woman, gave\\n      birth to another child. During her confinement the neurasthenic patient\\n      was in charge of her mother\\'s nurse, assisted by other servants. The\\n      nurse, while devoted to the daughter, agreed with the writer that excess\\n      of sympathy was injurious, and used her best and judicious endeavors\\n      gradually to persuade the patient to make some physical effort at walking\\n      and standing. In this she was so successful that in two weeks she\\n      accompanied the girl on half-mile walks up and down hill, finally without\\n      assistance. Thus, recovery seemed assured, and everything was favorable\\n      progressing towards it when the mother, having fully recovered, again took\\n      charge of her daughter, with the result that she at once took to her\\n      lounge and remained there two years longer. About that time other advice\\n      was urged and gladly acceded to, with the result that the case was\\n      diagnosed by an eminent surgeon as spinal paralysis in consequence of\\n      concussion, though it could never be shown when and where it occurred.\\n      Salves, plasters, anodynes, nervines, and electricity did no good, but\\n      effectually destroyed appetite and digestion, which higher to had been\\n      normal. So this adviser resigned in favor of a third, who, being a younger\\n      and less prejudiced man, agreed perfectly with the writer\\'s original\\n      opinion. He advised return to moderate exercise, avoidance of drugs, and\\n      less display of sympathy. This, though formerly rejected as\\n      \"unkind,\" was now acceded to as coming from a nerve- specialist,\\n      fresh from Europe, at that time very rare. Still attending the other\\n      members of the family, the writer had sample opportunity of observing the\\n      course of the case. Improvement was very slow and uncertain till financial\\n      misfortune overtook the family. Almost with a bound our patient left her\\n      cough, and, organizing a kindergarten, strove energetically in supporting\\n      herself and assisting her mother. The change came about in less than three\\n      weeks, and resulted in perfect recovery.\\n      \\n At this point another very instructive\\n      case of very speedy recovery, after six or seven years of neurasthenic\\n      prostration, deserves to be mentioned. A woman of 35 had been in bed and\\n      on the lounge most of the time for nearly seven years, at the end of which\\n      time she became my patient, her regular medical attendant having gone to\\n      Europe. She was of very amiable disposition and as sensitive as she was\\n      weak. Her symptoms, as in the other cases, were instantaneous exhaustion\\n      on the least physical exertion. She could give herself up to no mental\\n      occupation beyond directing her house-hold affairs, the education of her\\n      son, and the rehearsal of her numerous sensations. She had not been my\\n      patient long when her husband failed in business, so that the family was\\n      reduced from very comfortable circumstances to a condition which made it\\n      necessary for the patient to make her own living and that of the family.\\n      This she almost at once proceeded to do, setting aside all other\\n      considerations and establishing a boarding-house, where she did most of\\n      the work herself. This she has done now for ten or twelve years without a\\n      serious relapse. The time involved in the period of convalescence was\\n      scarcely more than three weeks, a although her work maybe said to have\\n      begun at the moment her resolution was taken.\\n      \\n Prognostics.-From these and other cases\\n      in and outside of the writer\\'s practice, it is safe to say that the\\n      majority of cases of neurasthenia recover, though years may elapse before\\n      that period. We learn, furthermore, that recoveries, especially of very\\n      inveterate cases, depend on conditions beyond the control of the\\n      physician, as was the case in the above-recorded instances, where\\n      circumstances forced the patient to cases to wish for recovery and to make\\n      an effort of the will. This having been once accomplished self-confidence,\\n      for a long time in abeyance, was permanently restored.\\n      \\n Curability, further, depends very much\\n      on the temperament of the patient, whether amiable, tractable and\\n      confiding in the honest endeavors of the physician, or whether refractory,\\n      suspicious, untruthful, selfish and antagonistic, of a disposition\\n      impossible to win over on account of unnatural distrust of every\\n      well-meaning person. The degree of intelligence of patients also has a\\n      pronounced influence on the result. The most readily curable cases are\\n      those acquired without hereditary predisposition, where the cause is found\\n      in the absence of food and sleep, also where sorrow and anxiety can be\\n      averted or counteracted by judicious conduct of near relatives and\\n      friends.\\n      \\n Dietetic Treatment.-This, as medicinal\\n      treatment, must be governed by the stage at which the case comes into the\\n      physician\\'s hands-whether yet in its prodromal, its acute or its chronic\\n      phase. The prodromal stage of the disease has no very decided\\n      pathognomonic signs. The most that can be recognized in this stage is that\\n      the patient\\'s habits or duties are of a kind which will eventually lead to\\n      obdurate neurasthenia if not arrested in time by removing the exciting\\n      causes. Too much pleasure, as well as too much care, especially in girls\\n      and woman, tends to neglect of food and rest, in the absence of which,\\n      excitements, whether of pleasure or care, begets a state of unrest in\\n      which repose is disagreeable. With such a condition comes a list of\\n      incipient casual complaints of headache, imperfect sleep, notional ways of\\n      eating, working or playing. A few questions will determine whether the\\n      patient is living according to normal or abnormal habits with regard to\\n      appetite, sleep and occupation. Where these are found, their alteration to\\n      normal ways must be instead on. It is unnecessary to say that this is\\n      easier said than done, for it will probably meet with serious objections\\n      on the part of the patient, if not on that of her relatives; for most\\n      likely she has examinations for college to prepare for, involving several\\n      months of dose and careful study at night, and the patient cannot waste\\n      time in sleeping and eating while cramming that little excited and\\n      ambitions brain. A failure in the examinations would be as much of a\\n      disappointment to parents as to patient, who proves, as usual, that this\\n      appellation is a misnomer. She accordingly goes in as she please, lied by\\n      an increasing morbidly ambitions impulse, and the result is likely to be\\n      the mournful satisfaction on the part of the physician of being obliged to\\n      say, \"I told you before what would happen.\" Of course, all\\n      regret the now evident nerve-prostration, while, if the doctor had\\n      succeeded in enforcing his rules, he would in many cases experience the\\n      still more painful reproach of having been too severe. Nevertheless,\\n      absolute firmness and a kindly but unflinching exertion of his will,\\n      without the least compromise, reward the physician with the best results\\n      in such cases.\\n      \\n When the case, after the stage of\\n      excitement and untiring restlessness (at which it would still be speedily\\n      curable by simple dietetic rules) has, after weeks or months, entered upon\\n      the phase of painful prostration, here we encounter backache, oppressive\\n      headache, and absolute loss of mental or bodily endurance, measures of\\n      dietetic management are much less effective and much more difficult to\\n      find. it is at this stage that slight rise of temperature will occur,\\n      especially towards evening; then the backache and headache disappear, the\\n      pallor is replaced by a flush of color, the eyes lose their listless look,\\n      and the patient is inclined to enter upon some diversion or excitement,\\n      followed by a restless night and a morning of exhaustion and a renewal of\\n      all painful sensations. Most of such patients feel much better in the\\n      evening when they are ready for some entertainment, while in a normal\\n      state this would be the time for relaxation and repose.\\n      \\n The dietetic treatment of this stage is\\n      methodical rest. In severe cases the patient will do well to remain in bed\\n      for several days or even for weeks. It is well to shorten this period as\\n      much as possible and to insist on walking about, or, at least. sitting for\\n      a specified time every day. This may be varied b equally specified periods\\n      of rest in the recumbent position.\\n      \\n Irregularities of eating are at this\\n      and at all times to be superseded by the most rigid regularity of meals.\\n      The traditional and conventional three-meal system, however well adapted\\n      to the needs of a vigorous man or woman, does not agree with the\\n      neurasthenic patient. It is much better that these should eat oftener;\\n      four times a day is best in most cases, for the simple reason that in this\\n      way a patient, while eating less at a time, consumes more food in the\\n      aggregate.\\n      \\n As neurasthenic patients are rarely\\n      troubled with absolute aversion to wholesome food, they are generally able\\n      to consume a liberal quantity, about which it is only needful to remark\\n      here that the food should be selected from among the articles and dishes\\n      which the patient likes, provided they belong to the order of good, normal\\n      articles of food, to the exclusion of those which simply please the taste\\n      without being digestible. A dish entirely of meat or \"animal\\n      food\" is as far from being a good diet for neurasthenics as one\\n      consisting entirely of \"vegetable\" food. As a rule, the diet\\n      list should comprise one-third of nitrogenous material and two-thirds of\\n      carbohydrates. Together with these, it is a great mistake to neglect the\\n      fats, such as good butter and the fats of meats. And, lastly, every\\n      patient of this kind should be made to drink some water often, a dietetic\\n      feature too often neglected.\\n      \\n During this stage, actually fatiguing\\n      exercise of body and mind should be avoided, while, on the other hand, the\\n      patient\\'s mind should be directed away from herself, in which she is much\\n      assisted by withholding a certain kind of emotional sympathy, quite as\\n      natural as it is difficult to repress on the part of affectionate persons.\\n      Of this, a few words further on.\\n      \\n There is no definite time for the\\n      duration of this stage, which, however, depends largely on the time during\\n      which the exciting causes have acted, either aided by or without a\\n      predisposition. It is certain, however, that the sooner it is recognized\\n      and the exciting causes eliminated, so much the sooner recovery will\\n      begin. But there is a stage at which the best of experience and judgment\\n      often fail, especially in very inveterate cases. If the case is one of a\\n      patient whom the physician has had opportunity of watching at least since\\n      the earlier stages, the difficulty is not so great as it is in old cases\\n      months or even of several years\\' duration which come to treatment late. In\\n      these, the line between the intermediate stage and incipient convalescence\\n      cannot be drawn. The patient is as neurasthenic and hypochondriacal as\\n      ever; cannot bear the slightest mental or bodily exertion, not even a word\\n      or a look, without sings of apparent exhaustion, while nearly the whole\\n      time is spent in bed under anxious care of sympathetic attendants. In such\\n      cases, having become assured, by careful physical examination, of the\\n      absence of organic disease, seeing the patient generally well nourished\\n      and in fair muscular condition, the physician is warranted in assuming\\n      that the disease has run its course, that whatever morbid (pathological)\\n      process there may have been progressing in the nervous system, this\\n      process has now come to and end, but it has left the patient\\'s mental\\n      condition habituated to the moods of the past months or years, and fixed,\\n      as it were, indelibly in the memory. It is the habit that now remains, not\\n      the disease.\\n      \\n If reasonably sure of this, and calling\\n      to mind the rapid recoveries and the circumstances attending them, as\\n      above detailed, the physician is now safe in ordering a more energetic\\n      treatment, calculated to rouse the self-reliance of the patient. All\\n      visible signs of sympathy must now be set aside; the actins and demeanor\\n      of the attendants should, from this time, if not before, be changed so as\\n      to give the patient the impression that she is no longer an invalid, but\\n      expected to rely on her own exertion. Instead of being fed, the food\\n      should be placed where she must go for and eat it. She should now be\\n      expected to dress and attend, without assistance, to her natural wants.\\n      This, with some temperaments, is almost impossible, with al extremely\\n      difficult. The best course to pursue is to remove such patients from\\n      sympathetic relatives or friends, and to place them in charge of kind,\\n      reliable, but eminently practical nurses.\\n      \\n The first effect of this is either to\\n      throw the patient into a stage of helpless despondency, which, again\\n      appealing powerfully to the sympathies of those nearest to her, often\\n      frustrates the physician\\'s plans which, if firmly but kindly adhered to,\\n      would, ere long, prove of their superiority by signs of returning\\n      self-reliance and absence of complaints on the part of the patient. A\\n      second form of effect is that occurring in patients of obstreperous,\\n      selfish disposition, whose opposition and even anger is aroused by being\\n      thrown on their own resources after the removal of depressing and\\n      unpractical sympathy. This opposition or temper, often manifested in all\\n      sorts of intrigues and subterfuges on the part of the patient, if not\\n      supinely yielded to by sympathetic persons, will finally be replaced by a\\n      more rational disposition. On the whole, anger or active opposition are\\n      signs of returning energy, which, once coming to the consciousness of the\\n      patient, takes the form of self- reliance. it is this way that the cures\\n      of chronic cases above related can be explained, and physicians should\\n      profit by such experience for the benefit of their patients.\\n      \\n The general dietetic management now\\n      readily follows from what has been said, and needs only a few general\\n      modifications. The first duty of the physician will be to test the degree\\n      of reliance to be placed on the patient and her friends, ad to win them\\n      over if possible to his plans, and his success will be in proportion to\\n      the degree of confidence he is able to inspire. This personal confidence\\n      should not degenerate into a mere personal liking or attachment of a\\n      sympathy-craving neurasthenic who should discover henceforth that all\\n      sentimental expressing of sympathy are about to take a practical form,\\n      aiming at a definite result-the patient\\'s health-which she wishes but\\n      cannot exert her will to attain. The best and often the only way to do\\n      away with sentiment and to reach practical kindness is to remove the\\n      patient from certain home influence, and to place her in a hospital or\\n      elsewhere under the management of competent nurses who, without being\\n      selfish, know how to exert a certain amount of wholesome push as fast as\\n      the patient can bear it. Without the removal of sentimental sympathy, all\\n      efforts at counteracting the purely hypochondriacal side of neurasthenia\\n      are useless.\\n      \\n In these cases of neurasthenia as yet\\n      uncomplicated with the hypochondriacal element of introspective nosomania,\\n      there is only one unconditional rule to be followed, especially in\\n      acquired cases whose evident cause was incessant, conscientious work of\\n      mind and body, together with insufficient food and sleep. Such cases come\\n      on very insidiously, the loss of strength-that is, the actual waste of\\n      nerve-substance-being just a trifle grater than the quantity restored, the\\n      patient unconsciously using up a minute part of her capital every day.\\n      Here the rule should be to reverse matters to insuring a supply of\\n      nourishment and time for its assimilation greater than was the case\\n      heretofore. The case of young school-girls belong in this class. The time\\n      of food and rest should be carefully controlled at home, the duty of the\\n      physician being to educate indifferent and ignorant parents up to an\\n      appreciation of the nature of the case. It is generally not difficult to\\n      open their eyes through the medium of their anxiety concerning their\\n      children\\'s health. Having thus insured sufficient rest and food at home,\\n      the physician\\'s next object of attention should be the regulations of the\\n      school. Here is the point where teachers have an opportunity of exerting\\n      their most practical influence. It should be made obligatory on the part\\n      of teachers to institute inquiry as to whether pupils have had their meals\\n      before coming to school. This they could often ascertain without a\\n      question, by reading the pupil\\'s condition in her emaciated form, pale\\n      face and nervous manner. To guard against neglect at home, it would be an\\n      easy matter to insist that all pupils of public and private schools should\\n      bring with them some proper food. The few who do so generally bring\\n      sweets-an apple, orange or a few dry crackers-when a piece of good bread\\n      and slice of cold meat would be what they actually need. All pupils should\\n      pass inspection, and if remiss in this important particular, the\\n      delinquent should be dismissed with several marks against her. To expect\\n      this of teachers would be a great advance in the place of futile\\n      innovations of endeavoring to send forth from our common schools graduates\\n      in arts and sciences.\\n      \\n Sudden Effects.-A large number of cases\\n      of neurasthenia, especially those complicated with inveterate\\n      Hypochondriasis, are frequently traced to some sudden occurrence, having\\n      the effect of a mental or physical shock. In one patient, a vigorous girl,\\n      used to romping, climbing and running lie a boy, the cause was supposed to\\n      be a slight thump she received during a game of blindman\\'s-buff. She\\n      thought nothing of it at the time, but it was suggested long after the\\n      patient\\'s illness began. In another case some mental shock of joy or\\n      grief, not very severe and such as is often experienced in every person\\'s\\n      life, is the beginning of months of nervous prostration.\\n      \\n There is quite an array of evidence\\n      that neurasthenia which has entered upon a hypochondriacal stage or\\n      complication with or without a strong hysterical admixture, is curable by\\n      sudden impressions in the form of a shock, or more gradually by frequent\\n      repetitions of an impression. Such cases, as I have shown above, occur\\n      most commonly in the stage when what may be considered the essential\\n      pathological disturbances of function have run their course and have left\\n      the patient in a state of mental disturbance which indicated that the\\n      patient\\'s recovery depends entirely upon her volition. But there is none,\\n      and so far nothing has succeeded in arousing it. Persuasion is as useless\\n      and irritating, as argument would be in a case of insanity with a fixed\\n      illusion. The resemblance between this and the state of mind of a\\n      hypochondriacal neurasthenic is very close. She cannot move nor thick.\\n      Exhaustion overcomes her and keeps her its victim for years, when suddenly\\n      the scene changes, and a few days or weeks suffice to restore the patient\\n      to activity. In one instance it is attributed to medical, in another to\\n      \"mind cure,\" in a third to \"Christian science;\" in\\n      still other cases massage has done it, in others again \"magnetic\\n      influence,\" in others the very powerful factor necessity. It is\\n      certain that cases of this kind, produced by sudden effects on the mind of\\n      a predisposed person, are also cured by such effects. Whatever the visible\\n      form of these effects may be -whether that of \"Christian\\n      science,\" joy, grief or absolute inexorable necessity, there is\\n      always to be noticed a certain force and condition involving the modern\\n      idea of suggestion, which comes to the patient in an irresistible degree\\n      and now sets the function of the will in motion again.\\n      \\n Experience teaches that it is by no\\n      means a matter of indifference which of these forms of effect are brought\\n      into action. In one case it is the professional Christian scientist\\'s\\n      method, in another the almost brutal exertion of a person\\'s will combined\\n      with some physical force. In either case the patient is aroused from his\\n      inertia, and discovers his powers of mental and bodily ability to act.\\n      \\n A deplorable result is that recoveries\\n      after such effects are attributed in the popular mind to supernatural\\n      causes. That such is not the case may be gathered form instances occurring\\n      in very sensible and intelligent patients, whose reason is scarcely ever\\n      so far disturbed and weakened that they do not resent the proposition of\\n      trying, e.g., Christian science or mind cure.\\n      \\n Nevertheless, it is the mind cure which\\n      the intelligent patient needs quite as much as the ignorant and\\n      superstitious person; the difference is only the form in which the\\n      influencing force is applied. While in one case it is obedience to the\\n      candidly expressed instructions of the physician, in the other case the\\n      result is the to mystification. In either case it is the powerful stimulus\\n      of hope and aroused confidence that recovery will be realized.\\n      \\n The definition of suggestion does not\\n      fully cover the meaning, because the influence employed is greater than\\n      mere suggestion. The physician\\'s plan of action should be straightforward\\n      assurance of recovery, a direct appeal to hope, and an unceasing endeavor\\n      to arouse the self-reliance of the patient, not so much by verbal\\n      exhortations as by a manner and department from which the patient learns\\n      more readily than from words what is expected. If the attitude of the\\n      physician is appreciated, and seconded by the relatives and attendants, a\\n      favorable result is much more certain to follow.\\n      \\n Hypnotism is not advisable. There are\\n      now existing ancient neurasthenic invalids dating from the times of\\n      spiritualism when they were famous \"mediums.\" Hypnotism weakness\\n      the will and nervous endurance, and produces a predisposition to emotional\\n      nervousness with an intractable erotic admixture. The suggestions sought\\n      to be instilled into a hypnotized patient amount to nothing. The mental\\n      influence of mystical treatment administered while the patients is awake\\n      is much more powerful in awaking hope and confidence than the uncertain\\n      effects of an abnormal state like that of hypnotism. Mystification, again,\\n      though sometimes unavoidable with the best intention, is less powerful\\n      than direct and intelligible encouragement. While resort to mystification\\n      should be shunned by reputable physicians, the question arises as to what\\n      shall be done with the many who, from lack of intelligence or education,\\n      are entirely beyond the reach of honest common sense, and who will persist\\n      in mystifying themselves, who remain neurasthenic invalids in spite of the\\n      best regulations of the physician, and who do not recover unless their\\n      encouragement follows some mystical formalities which alone arouse their\\n      \"faith\" and finally their confidence and will-power. For the\\n      present there is no way out of the dilemma but to submit such patients to\\n      the suggestive methods of what is popularly known as mind cure and\\n      Christian science. In doing so, physicians should use their influence as\\n      far as possible in selecting the most honest persons of this class.\\n      \\n DISCUSSION.\\n      \\n JAMES C. WOOD, M.D.: I have nothing but\\n      words of praise for Dr. Wesselhoeft\\'s excellent paper. It is very evident\\n      that the author\\'s inspiration came not from books but from actual contact\\n      with neurasthenic subjects, for the impress of originality is most\\n      conspicuous. It is a production which could only come from one of\\n      experience and from a reasoner. I consider it a most valuable contribution\\n      to the literature of that now most interesting subject,\\n      \"neurasthenia\".\\n      \\n The doctor, in his paper, has sometimes\\n      used the term \"neurasthenia\" instead of\\n      \"neurasthenia.\" The first of these means, according to Thomas,\\n      great nervous power or excitement; the second, nervous debility. I taken\\n      it from the context that the subject dealt with is neurasthenia. To the\\n      average mind there exists what seems to me a needless confusion regarding\\n      the terms, nervous prostration, hysteria and hystero-neurosis. As I\\n      understand these terms they define distinct conditions, though there is a\\n      frequent blending the one with the other. The term nervous prostration,\\n      which is a synonym of neurasthenia, defines itself; the term hysteria\\n      should be restricted to those general neuroses characterized particularly\\n      by psychical manifestations, though not infrequently by motor, sensory,\\n      secretory, vasomotor and reflex derangements as well; while the term\\n      hysteroneurosis implies the uterine origin of symptoms manifesting\\n      themselves in organs remote from the uterus without structural changes in\\n      such organs, being the direct result of reflex nervous influence starting\\n      from the uterus. The last term does not occur in the paper under\\n      discussion. From the standpoint of a gynecologist I think that this is\\n      misleading.\\n      \\n Let us see why and how it is that these\\n      three conditions (I will not call them diseases) are so frequently\\n      associated. I think that all will admit the frequent occurrence in woman\\n      of reflex symptoms, the result of pelvic lesions. An irritation staring\\n      form the pelvis is conveyed to the genito-spinal centre, thence to any or\\n      all organs with which this centre communicates. The organ oftener involved\\n      than any other is the stomach. This is shown by the frequent occurrence of\\n      nausea and vomiting following conception. The nervous system may have been\\n      previously involved, but oftener it becomes so only after the nutrition is\\n      depraved, which, sooner or later, occurs if the pelvic lesion is not\\n      removed. The depraved blood fails to supply the nerve centres with that\\n      which they need to sustain them, and they become anaemic. Prostration is\\n      but a subjective manifestation of the anaemia, and it varies in degree\\n      from a slight indisposition to the most abject helplessness.\\n      \\n If, then, nervous prostration may have\\n      its beginning in a pelvic lesion, is it possible for a pelvic lesion to be\\n      inaugurated by systemic disturbances? Personally, I believe that it is,\\n      and offer this explanation as the modus operandi by which such a lesion is\\n      induced: Marked circulatory changes nearly always attend nervous\\n      prostration. The circulation is presided over by the vaso-motor system,\\n      and wear and repair depend upon the proper regulation of this system. If\\n      it becomes disturbed, the bloodvessels dilate or contract unduly, with\\n      resulting local hyperaemia or local anaemia, as the case maybe. The\\n      climacteric flushes are the result of such disturbance. The alternate\\n      coldness and heat of the extremities, so often associated with rectal and\\n      uterine lesions, is another familiar illustration. If the brain is\\n      involved, either insomnia or drowsiness occur, depending upon whether the\\n      brain is anaemic or hyperaemic. Flatulence, gastralgia, and nervous\\n      dyspepsia result when the stomach is similarly affected. The womb and the\\n      ovaries, because of the periodical congestion imposed upon them, are\\n      oftener implicated by these unnatural circulatory disturbances than any of\\n      the pelvic organs, and in time also become unduly hyperaemic or anaemic,\\n      as the case may be.\\n      \\n It will thus be seen that nervous\\n      prostration may exist independently of pelvic lesions, or, conversely,\\n      pelvic lesions may exist independently of nervous prostration.\\n      Nevertheless, the two are frequently associated, and this fact ought, I\\n      believe, to be kept in mind in dealing with the affection known as\\n      neurasthenia. Hysterical manifestations nearly always come to the surface\\n      in nervous prostration, and they also frequently attend pelvic lesions.\\n      Indeed, the term \"hystero-psychosis\" has been coined for the\\n      purpose of defining certain psychical disturbances of presumably pelvic\\n      origin, and in the broadest sense neurasthenia is not uncommonly an\\n      hysteroneurosis. It is the frequent association of these three conditions\\n      which, it seems to me, makes it more practicable to study them conjointly.\\n      \\n The special symptoms of nervous\\n      prostration are most variable. Introspection, as Dr. Wesselhoeft has\\n      pointed out, makes of the patient a nosomaniac. The anaemic nerve centres\\n      are unduly impressionable, and a mental shock which would not seriously\\n      affect a stronger and more rugged woman falls with crushing force upon one\\n      whose nutrition is already depraved. In this way are developed disorders\\n      of sensibility, alternations of mobility, circulatory disturbances,\\n      anomalies of secretion and exertion, disorders of the gastro-intestinal\\n      canal, dermatoses, and general and psychical disturbances of all kinds.\\n      Many of these affections start from pelvic lesions, and are nearly always\\n      associated with depravity of nutrition and more or less nervous\\n      prostration.\\n      \\n Some of the worst symptoms of\\n      neurasthenia with which I have had to contend have been hyperaesthesia of\\n      the articulations, giving rise to the so-called \"hysterical\\n      joint.\" Here the prostration is usually not profound, and it is\\n      possible to apply the somewhat energetic treatment recommended by Dr.\\n      Wesselhoeft. I remember one case very distinctly, the detailed history of\\n      which I shall give in another place, which brought me much reputation\\n      because of the \"remarkable\" cure I was fortunate enough to make.\\n      \\n The patient, a beautiful girl of\\n      eighteen, had been bed- ridden for three years with supposed hip-joint\\n      disease. She was in college before assuming the ride of an invalid, and\\n      worried much over her studies and work. She sustained a fall a short time\\n      previously to taking to her bed, and to this fall the injury to the hip\\n      was attributed. She had been from physician to physician and from\\n      sanitarium to sanitarium without receiving benefit. All of the numerous\\n      medical men under whose care she had been, directed their attention to the\\n      hip and applied the classical treatment for morbus coxarius without avail.\\n      The patient had finally reached a point where introspection was her chief\\n      occupation and her mind dwelt almost continually upon a \"diseased\\n      hip.\" She was finally brought to me, coming in an invalid\\'s chair and\\n      looking the very picture of dependency. There was a slight degree of\\n      anaemia, though this was not marked. Notwithstanding the expression\\n      expression of abjectness the girl did not look seriously ill. The hip was\\n      excessively tender upon pressure, but there was no local increase of\\n      temperature, no evidences of fever and suppuration, and forcible\\n      apposition by striking the heel was not very painful. More less spastic\\n      contraction of the flexor muscles of the affected side existed, which gave\\n      to the limb an appearance of actual shortening, which was very deceptive.\\n      Hysterical symptoms were common. On examination I found the left ovary\\n      exquisitely tender. Compression of the ovary increased the pain in the hip\\n      most decidedly and gave rise to much nervous agitation. I did not,\\n      therefore, deem it wise to recommend local treatment other than the daily\\n      use of the hot douche. She had long been a victim of ovarian\\n      dysmenorrhoea. I placed upon the ankle of the affected limb three pounds\\n      of bar-lead, prescribed a pair of crutches and insisted upon her walking.\\n      The lead was used to overcome the spastic contraction as well as for its\\n      moral effect. I did not deem the joint lesion of such a character as to\\n      used extension. In two months\\' time this patient discarded her crutches\\n      for a cane. Six weeks later she put up the cane and is now perfectly well.\\n      \\n This was a case in which somewhat harsh\\n      measures were eminently appropriate.\\n      \\n In marked contrast to the case just\\n      recorded is the following: Mrs.-, aet. 47, widow for twenty years. She is\\n      a devoted church-woman, and for years was a leader in all charitable work\\n      done in the community in which she resided. Through friends she was urged\\n      to consult me, and I think that the call to the neighboring town in which\\n      she lived was countermanded at least four or five times before the finally\\n      mustered up courage and strength enough to see me. Upon reaching the\\n      bedside I found my patient in a room made dark by closed blinds, over\\n      which were hung heavy blankets to shut out every ray of light. The mirror\\n      was turned toward the wall for fear a ray of light might strike it and\\n      flesh throughout the darkened room. Nor did the patient rest under these\\n      extreme precautions, for the eyes were protected with two pairs of colored\\n      glasses with side attachments. Hyperaesthesia of the sense of hearing was\\n      equally marked and the noise was excluded from the room by double doors\\n      whose keyholes were stuffed with cotton. She l so had her ears filled with\\n      cotton, over which she wore ear-mufflers. She was emaciated to an extreme\\n      degree, and had been reduced to her miserable condition by a series of\\n      events which frequently precede profound neurasthenia. Her husband was\\n      killed during the war, and she was left childless. Twelve months previous\\n      to taking to her bed she nursed her mother through a long and fatal\\n      illness. This greatly prostrated her, yet she kept up until a favorite\\n      brother-in-law was thrown from a carriage and killed. This was the last\\n      straw, and the shock compelled her to take to her bed. In due time loss of\\n      appetite with irritability of the stomach developed, which, of course, led\\n      to marked depravity of nutrition. With the anaemia came hyperaesthesia of\\n      the special senses, spinal irritation, headache, hysterical\\n      manifestations, etc. There was no series pelvic lesion, although she had\\n      been much treated for an alleged uterine displacement with congestion.\\n      Unfortunately, she was encouraged, instead of discouraged, in her\\n      invalidism, and she soon became a nosomaniac of the worst type. She had\\n      written down her symptoms one at a time, and the record is such a typical\\n      one that I should like to give it in full, but time forbids.\\n      \\n With great difficulty the patient was\\n      moved on a cough to a private hospital and placed under the Weir Mitchell\\n      treatment. I ignored the pelvic trouble entirely. It is unnecessary to\\n      give in detail the progress of the case from day to day after this\\n      treatment was inaugurated. Suffice it to say that the improvement was of\\n      the most marked character, and in six weeks from the time she entered the\\n      hospital she walked to her carriage with her eyes and ears unprotected.\\n      She soon resumed her church and charitable work, in which she again takes\\n      much delight.\\n      \\n This woman wanted to get well. She was\\n      a woman of pure motives and high ideals. She had, in the language of Dr.\\n      Wesselhoeft, the wish, but, unaided, not the will. She required the aid of\\n      an intelligent, strong-minded, nurse who could bring to her exercise\\n      applied in such a way as to enable her to assimilate food without the\\n      expenditure of nerve force. She co- operated with her physician and nurse\\n      in every possible way, and as soon as the anaemic nerve cells became\\n      flushed with new blood she began to improve. To have commanded this\\n      patient \"to take up her bed and walk\" before improving her\\n      nutrition would have been as unscientific as to have placed the first\\n      patient in bed with extension and counter-extension applied to the limb. I\\n      know of no class of cases requiring for their successful treatment more\\n      tact and discrimination than that under consideration.\\n      \\n I feel confident that I have many times\\n      cut the affection short in its prodromal stage by removing the girl from\\n      college work and insisting upon open-air exercise. Static electricity has,\\n      in my hands, proved exceedingly useful both during the prodromal stage and\\n      that of convalescence.\\n      \\n I will conclude by saying that I have\\n      been impressed with the frequency with which an hereditary history of\\n      epilepsy has been met with in the cases of neurasthenia passing under my\\n      observation.'\n",
      " 'Tresorie - SOME OF THE DISEASES PREVENTING AND COMPLICATION PREGNANCY\\n[Diseases Preventing & Complicating Pregnancy]\\n\\n STERILITY.-DeSinety, Treub, Furbinger,\\n      et al., attribute 50 per cent. of unproductive marriages to the husbands,\\n      saying that sterility in the male is more often the cause of barren\\n      marriages than is generally supposed.\\n      \\n This cause of sterility I pass by, as\\n      also sterility due to mechanical obstruction, incomplete ovulation and the\\n      numerous other causes of this condition, too manifold for mere\\n      enumeration, to consider obesity as a causative agent in this condition. I\\n      need not say that the advocates for surgical interference for the relief\\n      of this condition are legion. Sims makes the assertion that sterility can\\n      be cured by surgical means only. That, of course, is Allopathic arguing\\n      pure and simple. Cases requiring surgical interference do arise, but any\\n      treatment which raises the nutrition of the entire organism, improves the\\n      blood-formation, and favors the resorption of pathological products in the\\n      sexual organs, is to be regarded as the indicated remedy.\\n      \\n Published statements are my authority\\n      for saying that excellent results have followed the administration of\\n      drugs, nevertheless; and in complete defiance of all therapeutic measures,\\n      a certain percentage of women remain barren; for with the more occult\\n      causes of sterility we remain, as yet, unacquainted, consequently they\\n      cannot all be reached with say kind of treatment whatever.\\n      \\n The following case I report somewhat in\\n      detail. Whilst not an exceptional case at all, it bears directly upon the\\n      subject under consideration, and possesses, it seems to me, some decidedly\\n      interesting features. My object in selecting this particular one is to\\n      call attention, if possible, to a condition not sufficiently considered.\\n      Mrs. J., aet. 26, married about two years and a half, appealed to my\\n      knowledge for a reason as to why she remained childless. The lady was\\n      carrying an excess of flesh, being under the medium height, and weighing\\n      186 pounds, but appeared to be in good health; family and previous history\\n      all that could be desired. Examination showed none of the common causes of\\n      sterility; neither, so far as I could ascertain, was the husband\\n      responsible for this unproductive condition of affairs. Some previous\\n      experiences of my own, with the added testimony of other and able men, was\\n      my reason for charging this condition of things to the excess of flesh,\\n      this, by the husband, being laughingly charged to excess of laziness.\\n      \\n We all, undoubtedly, are familiar with\\n      that peculiar disease of the blood-corpuscles which, whilst producing\\n      flesh, relaxes at the same time the muscular force; acting also, I\\n      believe, upon the muscular fibres of the uterus and upon the ovaries,\\n      inducing not only serious menstrual disorders but sterility. McKee,\\n      Philbert, and others give several instances of sterility chargeable to\\n      obesity, the women in question having been married several years without\\n      bearing children, and all became mothers after losing a portion of their\\n      flesh. If any other argument were needed in support of this theory we\\n      might turn to the quadrupeds, where we find the poorest breeders among the\\n      fleshiest animals. Fournel has a very able treatise on \"The Effects\\n      of Obesity on the Menstrual Functions and Parturition.\" Without\\n      having had any actual case of this description to deal with, he inclines\\n      very strongly towards the belief that obesity favors sterility. In the\\n      treatment of the case before mentioned, the patient was subjected to a\\n      daily massage of the entire body, with a special pelvic massage three\\n      times a week. This, in the main, consists in elevating the uterus as high\\n      as possible with the finger in the vagina, ending with a quick and decided\\n      vibratory motion. The diet received particular attention, as at this time\\n      there was a slight gastric ailment. The indicated remedy, Thuja, was given\\n      in the minimum dose. At the end of three months almost thirty pounds of\\n      flesh was gone, a considerable reduction. As an experiment, I recommended\\n      coitus in the knee-elbow position, advising that the lady remain quiet as\\n      long as possible after coition, with thighs well flexed. She became\\n      enciente, but miscarried at eight weeks. There was, comparatively\\n      speaking, but little pain and not much subsequent haemorrhage. She made a\\n      rapid recovery. Since then a living child has been born to them.\\n      \\n I believe I am safe in saying that this\\n      result would hardly have obtained were it not for the prophylactic\\n      measures adopted.\\n      \\n At the end of the first two months the\\n      patient was attacked with haemorrhage. A similar occurrence took place at\\n      irregular intervals during the following five months, the quantity of\\n      blood lost being much greater than that at the normal menstrual period.\\n      \\n For the greater part of the last five\\n      months she kept her bed, at the end of which time the tendency of the\\n      uterus to empty itself could be resisted no longer. A seven months\\' child\\n      was born, and is to-day doing well.\\n      \\n Pseudocyesis cerebral pregnancy,\\n      phantom pregnancy (whatever name we may call it by) is a disease which\\n      must come under the head of those \"complicating pregnancy.\" Mrs.\\n      M., a lady, married two or three years, aet. 29. Previous history good,\\n      always enjoying perfect health. When I first saw the lady in question she\\n      was a perfect picture of health, and, according to appearance and her own\\n      statements, about seven months pregnant. I made no examination. This\\n      appeared to be a thoroughly intelligent woman, and, according to her own\\n      statement, there was cessation of the menses. There certainly was an\\n      enlargement of the abdomen and breasts, a milky secretion, and the lady\\n      was sure that she felt foetal movement. On February 28th of the present\\n      year I was called to attend her in labor. Examination showed that no\\n      pregnancy existed. So far as I could ascertain there was no assignable\\n      origin for this condition other than nervous influences, the phenomena\\n      being purely muscular distension of the abdomen.\\n      \\n Mayham reports a case of a woman 73\\n      years old, claiming to be pregnant; he also claims that subsequently she\\n      was delivered of a child; this is an Allopathic report, however, of which\\n      we will take a Homoeopathic dose. Haultain reports three cases of cerebral\\n      pregnancy. In the first, he says no cause whatever was to be found; in the\\n      second, there was a small fibroid growth in the anterior uterine wall.\\n      Hauck reports a case where the vomiting, peristalsis, and flatus, caused\\n      by alcoholism were supposed to be caused by the pregnant state. Such cases\\n      are uncommon, but they emphasize the importance of making a thorough\\n      examination, in all cases where positive information is desired of the\\n      existence or non-existence of pregnancy.\\n      \\n Hyperemesis Gravidarum.-An animated\\n      discussion, held recently between two celebrated Allopaths of Stuttgart\\n      and Leipsic, has served to awaken a renewed interest in this subject,\\n      without in the least adding anything new to our stock of knowledge\\n      regarding its aetiology. Notwithstanding the frequency of the vomiting of\\n      pregnancy, its very distressing character in many instances, and its\\n      imminent, its very distressing character in many instances, and its\\n      imminent danger, we find but very few contributions of any value, to\\n      either the aetiology of the disorder or its therapeutics. I do not expect\\n      to add anything specially new myself, but it does seem to me that our\\n      knowledge of the vomiting of pregnancy, is to say the least, in a most\\n      contradictory state. Some physicians look upon it as a trifling matter,\\n      others as a thing to be endured, and some-these are in the right too-view\\n      even the mildest cases with gravity. Even in the mildest cases of morning\\n      sickness there is a constant drain upon the nervous system, putting the\\n      sufferer into a condition, in which she is very much less able to endure\\n      parturition than she would otherwise have been.\\n      \\n Dr. Harrison Mettler says: \"After\\n      careful inquiry I find that women who suffer from much morning sickness\\n      have as a rule, tedious or otherwise troublesome labors. I have observed\\n      in multiparae that at one time they will have much nausea and vomiting\\n      followed by a difficult labor, while at another time they will be quite\\n      free from the vomiting, and will pass through the succeeding labor with\\n      comparative ease.\" I must say my observations make me agree with Dr.\\n      Mettler entirely; when one thinks how rapidly the mildest of cases assume\\n      pernicious forms, indifference is certainly no longer to be excused. There\\n      is a voluminous literature upon this subject, and many and varied are the\\n      aetiological reasons given for this very variable affection, a large\\n      majority of writers coinciding in the opinion that \"many causes\\n      operate together,\" to produce what we are pleased to designate the\\n      \"vomiting of pregnancy.\" I believe myself that in a large\\n      percentage of cases, this pernicious vomiting is simply the result of a\\n      reflex neurosis. Undoubtedly uterine displacements frequently cause\\n      vomiting; but when this is so, and the displaced organ is raised by\\n      packing the vagina with aseptic wool, the vomiting ceases.\\n      \\n Lillie reports a number of cases, where\\n      obstinate vomiting was caused by a retroflexed uterus, and restoration of\\n      the organ caused a cessation of the disorder. Bezugloff having a\\n      persistent case of morning sickness, introduced a bougie it no the uterus,\\n      the intention being to produce abortion; the immediate result was a\\n      stoppage of the vomiting, and the pregnancy went on to full term.\\n      \\n In the case just cited, I must say that\\n      I believe it was the fright, caused by the thought of abortion being\\n      performed, more than the effects of introducing the bougie, which operated\\n      so successfully; I say now, as I said before, I believe that the\\n      pre-eminent cause of this kind of sickness must be looked for i the\\n      nervous system. Flint speaks of this form of sickness as being decidedly\\n      neurotic in its origin, and cites a number of cases of a chronic variety\\n      of dyspepsia frequently occurring in young girls. I had one such case come\\n      under my personal care. There was a persistent morning sickness, with this\\n      young lady, and a disagreeable nausea whenever food was taken; this\\n      patient was at some distance from her home, in a boarding school, and she\\n      will probably never know that the lady principal entertained very grave\\n      thoughts at one time in regard to her virtue. It certainly was very\\n      difficult to differentiate between this and the vomiting of pregnancy; it\\n      was, however, simply due to a vitiated nervous system. My theory is\\n      supported by Alt, who records a number of such cases; I cite one only, the\\n      case being that of a highly hysterical woman, six months pregnant,\\n      suffering from the gravest vomiting, and anxious that miscarriage be\\n      induced. She was making preparation for entering the hospital for this\\n      purpose, when one of her children was seized with pneumonia. The anxiety\\n      felt over the child, forced all thought of self from the mother\\'s mind;\\n      from that moment the vomiting ceased and she remained well until the\\n      termination of pregnancy.-Minchener Medicinische Wochenschrift.\\n      \\n Whilst saying that I believe this\\n      disease to be in the majority of cases of purely nervous origin, I would\\n      not imply thereby that it is not to be feared, far from it; if neglected,\\n      we know how likely it is to pass quickly beyond treatment and our patient\\n      succumb from sheer exhaustion.\\n      \\n In the treatment cited such as\\n      insertion of bougies, dilation of the os, pelvic massage, etc., I believe\\n      it is merely the \"doing something,\" no matter much what it is,\\n      so long as you have gained the confidence of your patient, that does good.\\n      We have seen how suddenly Hyperemesis will cease if the patient be\\n      alarmed; it may be, has often been, and will to again, cured by a process\\n      skin to suggestion. Kattenback had a case where the patient, a primipara,\\n      was seized with an incorrigible vomiting. It was suggested to her that her\\n      stomach contained some lumps of unwholesome material and their removal\\n      would cure her. Some milk was given her, and the stomach ceremoniously\\n      washed out. its contents bore no indications of either over-acidity or\\n      abnormal ferment She was informed that she was all right and the vomiting\\n      would not return; neither did if, and she was safely delivered at term.\\n      \\n There is a familiar and now well-know\\n      phenomena, by which these neurotics can be influenced; I speak of\\n      hypnotism; it is due to purely subjective conditions.\\n      \\n There is an identity of the hypnotic\\n      susceptibility with the condition of hysteria, and it is along these lines\\n      that we can work. Just as many times as I have tried this method of\\n      treatment, for these cases of excessive vomiting, just so many times has\\n      it given me gratifying results.\\n      \\n The patient can be to sleep by\\n      bi-ocular pressure, and the idea of cure suggested; the operation may have\\n      to be repeated several times, at intervals of a day or so, but you will be\\n      rewarded by the cessation of the vomiting, often with but one suggestion.\\n      Where the patient is not easily controlled by means of the bi-ocular\\n      pressure, Luy\\'s revolving mirror is a never failing resource.'\n",
      " 'Tresorie - PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS [Presidential Address]\\n\\n THE ROLE OF HOMOEOPATHY IN THE SECOND\\n      \\n By ALVA BENJAMIN, M.B.CH.B., F.F.HOM.\\n      \\n Such a system of medicine must\\n      recognize that it is as much an art as a science, and that healing is a\\n      relationship between two living personalities. It must recognize too, that\\n      the sick individual has to take an active part in his treatment and not be\\n      merely the passive recipient of this or that treatment. For just as it is\\n      rightly said that man does not live by alone, so should it be emphasized\\n      that man cannot be cured by medicine alone. He must see to it himself that\\n      he lives as far as possible a physically and psychically healthy life.\\n      Indeed, each individual has a power within himself to help in his own\\n      cure.\\n      \\n Do the official schools of medicine\\n      teach such an art today? I am afraid not: they are so intent on seeking\\n      the specific treatment for this or that named disease or the antibiotic\\n      that will most effectively put out of action the organism regarded as the\\n      cause of the disease, that they are losing sight of the individual\\n      himself.\\n      \\n But Homoeopathy in its persistent\\n      search for the reactions of the individual to his environment in the\\n      broadest sense, no matter of what the patient is complaining surely\\n      fulfills these requirements, especially when it is recognized that the\\n      homoeopathic potencies do not anything to the patient as do the drugs of\\n      the dominant school, but rather stimulate the patients own recuperative\\n      powers to overcome the infection or re - establish the normal metabolism\\n      which has become deranged by the illness.\\n      \\n When you consider how the homoeopathic\\n      physician diagnoses the individuality of his patient over and above the\\n      name of the disease from which he is suffering, and uses for the purpose\\n      of his prescription rather than the name of the disease this personal\\n      diagnosis of the patients mental and emotional reactions, his responses to\\n      changes in weather conditions, the alternations in his environment which\\n      influence his symptoms, etc., one realize how very individualistic is the\\n      Homoeopathic prescription fitted to that particular patient.\\n      \\n The homoeopathic physician does not\\n      seek for a remedy specific to any named disease and which he can thus\\n      apply almost automatically once he has made his organic diagnosis, which\\n      in quite an appreciable number of instances may ultimately be found to be\\n      wrong and so the treatment based upon it must therefore have been wrong.\\n      He does not, as is so often done, merely suppress the most outstanding\\n      symptom by an appropriate drug; for example giving an anodyne to mask the\\n      pain or removing the skin eruption by some strong local application, in\\n      other words putting the dust under the mat and pretending the room is\\n      clean.\\n      \\n Strangely enough the homoeopathic\\n      physician is often accused by his allopathic critic in his ignorance of\\n      Homoeopathy, of merely treating symptoms, whereas it is the critic himself\\n      who practices this superficial medicine. The homoeopathic physician, on\\n      the other hand, treats his patient as a whole through his symptoms and\\n      their modifications through changes in the environment, which is quite a\\n      different matter.\\n      \\n Homoeopathic therapy, unlike methods of\\n      treatment, is based on a natural law \"Similia Similibus\\n      Curentur\" \"Likes may be cured by likes\" which has been\\n      proved time and time again by experiment and which anyone with the will to\\n      do may prove for himself. It is not subject to constant change brought\\n      about by this or that latest discovery, and which itself will soon have to\\n      give way to the still later idea.\\n      \\n Having now introduced to you our actor,\\n      what of the scene in which he is to play his role?\\n      \\n This is the nineteen hundred and fifty\\n      - fourth year of the Christian era and the second year of the reign of our\\n      much loved and admired young Queen Elizabeth II, who will remember while\\n      in south Africa on her twenty - first birthday, before she had any idea\\n      that she would so soon be called to such an exalted position as she holds\\n      today, broadcast to the commonwealth and Empire her resolve to dedicate\\n      her life to the service of this grand community which dedication she\\n      recently repeated at her Coronation.\\n      \\n Here in Great Britain we have a more or\\n      less complete welfare state, with which idea some of us may very strongly\\n      disagree, whilst others believe such a development is the result of a\\n      natural very desirable social evolution.\\n      \\n As one necessary ingredient of this\\n      welfare state came, in 1948, the initiation of the National Health\\n      Service, through which the great majority of the population receives its\\n      medical attention, although it is rightly available to all.\\n      \\n When we come to consider the role that\\n      homoeo - therapeutics should play in this scheme, I would suggest that we\\n      should regard the problem from the purely medical aspect, forgetting any\\n      political party allegiances or sympathies we may have; or if we cannot\\n      forget them we should remember that the organization of the National\\n      Insurance Scheme of which the National Health Service is but a part, was\\n      first blue printed by the well - known Liberal supporter, Lord Beveridge,\\n      and the Health Service plans developed by the Coalition Government of all\\n      three major political parties.\\n      \\n We are living at present in an age\\n      which may very justifiably be regarded as a violent age in which have been\\n      developed so many appalling instruments of destruction, the use of some of\\n      which we are quite complacently accepting and from the use of others we\\n      are refraining, not because we consider them immoral, but simply through\\n      the fear of the wholesale destruction which would be caused by their use.\\n      We are seeing X-rays used in very high voltages in the treatment of\\n      cancer, we are being constantly remained of the use of dangerous drugs in\\n      medicine, without justification, in my opinion, bearing in mind the\\n      doubtful and evanescent ameliorations they produce and the violent\\n      surgical treatment of mental patients.\\n      \\n One further violence we should not\\n      forget is the way some of our foods are devitalized by the extraction of\\n      this or that portion of the natural product for purposes quite foreign to\\n      the well - being of the people who are to feed on them; or they are\\n      contaminated by the addition of this or that dangerous chemical, either\\n      during the growing of the plant, in the form of sprays, or as so called\\n      improvers in, for instance, the manufacture of white bread. It is very\\n      significant in this regard that quite a lot of attention is paid to the\\n      protection of the man who sprays the crops, but the right of the consumer\\n      to have uncontaminated food is slurred over by the unjustifiable statement\\n      that the amount of these chemicals so consumed is so small that it cannot\\n      have any bad effect on the consumer. We who practice Homoeopathy know how\\n      unwarranted is such a statement.\\n      \\n Can we homoeopathic physicians and\\n      patient hope to be able to do anything to make the still small voice of\\n      Homoeopathy heard in all this tumult, so that we may return to a saner and\\n      more healthful way of life and help our young Queen in her lifes work for\\n      the communitys sake?\\n      \\n Can we expect any help from the leaders\\n      of the medical profession? I am afraid not, because although I believe it\\n      accurate to state that there is a very slowly growing interest in, and\\n      tolerance of our work by individual doctors, the medical authorities are\\n      still, in their prejudice, strongly opposed to us. The London University\\n      still refuses to recognize our Hospital as a post - graduate teaching\\n      Hospital: the British Medical Association prohibits the formation of a\\n      homoeopathic section of its organization, and the Royal College of\\n      Physicians still refuses its membership to any one known as a homoeopathic\\n      physician. Yet in spite of this unfavourable environment, I firmly believe\\n      that there is a future for our method of therapeutics: but it will have to\\n      be pursued with courage, determination, foresight and energy. Surely if we\\n      believe as I do, that we are the guardians of a system of treatment\\n      destined to make our people healthier and therefore more efficient and\\n      happier, we would be failing in our duty to our country if we did not take\\n      every means in our power to acquaint the community at large with the\\n      advantages of this system and the dangers of ignoring it. This is a duty,\\n      not only of the profession, but also of the laity interested in\\n      Homoeopathy and who have experienced its benefits.\\n      \\n Every physician has two professional\\n      obligation to the community, that of preserving its health and that of\\n      endeavouring to restore it to being when it has fallen by the way.\\n      \\n The homoeopathic physician, thorough\\n      his knowledge acquired through the provings of drugs, even in\\n      infinitesimal doses, has, I believe, a very special responsibility as\\n      regards the prophylaxis of disease. It seems to me that a great deal of\\n      chronic ill health may quite conceivably be due to the manipulations of\\n      our foods and to the artificial manuring of the ground in which many of\\n      them are grown. Experiments have been carried our proving that plants\\n      grown in soil enriched by natural manuring, are much less prone to\\n      diseases than those grown with the help of artificial chemical manures. It\\n      seems a fairly justified conclusion that vegetables grown under these\\n      artificial conditions may quite well be deficient in something necessary\\n      for our perfect health. It is therefore incumbent upon the physician to\\n      advocate whenever possible the ingestion of healthily grown foods in the\\n      widest sense of that term.\\n      \\n The same duty applies when we consider\\n      the great amount of drugging in which the community at large indulges by\\n      its excessive smoking, particularly when aggravated by the practice of\\n      inhaling, and by the continued and prolonged use of drugs for this or that\\n      symptom, too often, unfortunately, though not always, on the prescription\\n      of their medical advisors.\\n      \\n There is a great lack throughout the\\n      community of any real enthusiasm for perfect health: we are only too prone\\n      to be content to follow like sheep, the unintelligent and harmful\\n      practices of the majority of our fellows.\\n      \\n Similarly in the curative realm, we\\n      homoeopathic physicians have special obligations.\\n      \\n When considering our position vis-a-vis\\n      the rest of the profession, we must never lose sight of the fact that our\\n      approach to the sick individual is a much broader and more comprehensive\\n      one than that of the dominant school. This latter prides itself on its\\n      scientific approach to its problems. One must, however, always be on ones\\n      guard against being hypnotized by that word scientific. The scientific\\n      aspect of any phenomenon or problem dealing with humanity is only one\\n      limited aspect of that problem. To get a complete picture one must\\n      consider other aspect, such as the aesthetic, emotional, maybe religious,\\n      and above all, perhaps one might say embracing all, the philosophical\\n      approach. This complex approach to his patients problem is the one that\\n      the homoeopathic physician always strives to adopt, and so never loses\\n      sight of the ego of the patient, while at the same time not forgetting his\\n      physical make - up.\\n      \\n Because this approach of ours to our\\n      patients is a much broader and more comprehensive one than the much\\n      vaunted scientific aspect, which the dominant school has come to regard as\\n      the Ultima Thule of medicine, I deplore the oft - repeated request of some\\n      of my colleagues that we should forsake our philosophy and make our work\\n      as scientific as theirs. I do not mean to imply by this that we should\\n      neglect the scientific angle of our patients illness but we should always\\n      remember that is only one facet of our problem. That is why we take such\\n      pains to diagnose our patients personality with his reaction to his\\n      environment in addition to the physical diagnosis of the case in order to\\n      arrive at our prescription for his malady. In other words, we should\\n      endeavour to lead our dominant school colleagues to our way of thinking,\\n      rather than that we should adopt theirs.\\n      \\n At the same time must always remember\\n      that if our philosophy should seem at any time to contradict so - called\\n      scientific laws, we must re - examine our philosophy, and if necessary\\n      modify it, while at the same time remembering that many times in the past\\n      what have been regarded as laws have ultimately been proved not to be so.\\n      Thus it is evident that we must never relax our self - examination.\\n      \\n What shall be the role of the\\n      homoeopathic laity?\\n      \\n The first thing for them to remember is\\n      that we are living in a democratic country whose government is dependent\\n      on the goodwill of the governed, and that, if a sufficient number of\\n      voters desire a certain line of action, that line will be adopted by the\\n      government.\\n      \\n The second thought is that there are\\n      not nearly sufficient doctors practising Homoeopathy in Great Britain to\\n      satisfy the present demand, let alone any further increased demand in the\\n      future, for this line of treatment.\\n      \\n Does not this seem strange, having\\n      regard to the great advantage to humanity that Homoeopathy provides? Not\\n      if one looks below the surface and so finds the reason for this shortage.\\n      \\n Surely the most potent reason is that\\n      Homoeopathy is not taught in the official Medical Schools, either as a pre\\n      - or post - graduate study. The London University when asked to recognize\\n      the Royal London Homoeopathic Hospital as a post - graduate Medical\\n      School, refused on the plea that as Homoeopathy was not taught in the\\n      undergraduate Medical Schools, it could not find a place for it in its\\n      post - graduate curriculum.\\n      \\n It is, of course, nonsense to suggest\\n      that a graduate should pursue his studies only in those subject of which\\n      he had already obtained some knowledge in his undergraduate days and\\n      should not wish to obtain information on any new or extra subject.\\n      \\n The University Medical Shools are\\n      enabled to a great extent through Government grants. We must therefore\\n      find some way of influencing whatever Government be in power to bring\\n      pressure to bear upon the London University to remove this obstacle to the\\n      better health of the community at large. I am quite satisfied that once\\n      this academic recognition is obtained we shave many more post - graduate\\n      students of Homoeopathy.\\n      \\n I believe than in a democratic\\n      community, having a universal State Medical Service, it is the bounden\\n      duty of the Government to remove all obstacles to the peoples obtaining\\n      that form of medical treatment in which they have confidence. So long as\\n      Homoeopathy is denied its legitimate status, so long must be Government be\\n      deemed to b failing in its duty to the country.\\n      \\n If, however, we are to achieve this\\n      desirable object of full recognition, we must all, professional and laity,\\n      be fired with enthusiasm, not only for the abstract cause of Homoeopathy,\\n      but for being partners with our young Queen in delicating our lives to the\\n      community.\\n      \\n When we do this we shall help to make\\n      this second Elizabethan era one to be remembered throughout the ages to\\n      come as surpassing the first Elizabethan era in that it gained not so much\\n      the economic and political leadership of the world - though that is not to\\n      be despised - but showed the way to the most healthful and spiritual way\\n      of life that all the world look notice and followed suit.\\n      \\n To sum up, the Role of Homoeopathy, as\\n      I see it, is to humanize the practice of medicine. By that I mean it must\\n      bring the practice of medicine into line with a reasoned philosophy of\\n      life, restore to it its artistry and rid it of all unnecessary hazards. It\\n      is to do this, not from any abstract academic sense of superiority, but in\\n      order the years to come are not those of merely another reign, but to\\n      ensure a veritable Renaissance, starting with the second Elizabethan era\\n      in which Great Britain will take its rightful place in the comity of\\n      nations as the pathfinder to a way of life for which posterity will be\\n      able to say \"Thank God for Queen Elizabeth the Second and her\\n      peoples.'\n",
      " 'Tresorie - Roentgenometric Pelvimetry [Roentgenometric Pelvimetry]\\n CHARLES W.PERKINS, M.D.\\n      \\n Norwalk, Conn\\n      \\n FOR some time the x-ray has been used\\n      to advantage in diagnosis of multiple pregnancy, position of fetus and\\n      fetal abnormalities. However, it has been only the past four or five years\\n      that any definite information has been obtained by roentgenographic\\n      methods of diagnoses in pelvimetry.\\n      \\n At the present time we are convinced\\n      that only by means of roentgenographs can be true proportions of the\\n      superior strait be determined, and that the ordinary external methods of\\n      Pelvimetry are not only occasionally misleading but proportionately\\n      inaccurate.\\n      \\n The present communication deals with\\n      the method of Herbert Thomas of Yale University. This method was developed\\n      in cooperation with the late Dr. W.A. Lafield, who was Professor of\\n      Roentgenology at the Yale Medical School.\\n      \\n Some of the reasons why roentgen\\n      pelvimetry has not been more universally adopted are probably due to the\\n      following factors.\\n      \\n (1) The majority of women will be\\n      delivered normally, whether or not pelvic measurements are made.\\n      \\n (2) The medical profession does not\\n      readily accept a new method after an established satisfactory routine has\\n      been in use.\\n      \\n (3) A new method of diagnosis incurs\\n      added expense.\\n      \\n (4) The present methods, although\\n      entirely speculative, are satisfactory in most cases.\\n      \\n (5) Roentgen pelvimetry cannot be\\n      performed by the obstetrician himself but requires the aid of a\\n      roentgenologist.\\n      \\n (6) The value of roentgenometric\\n      diagnosis is recent in origin and as yet not universally accepted.\\n      \\n If the knowledge of the size and shape\\n      of the pelvis is necessary to the practice of obstetrics, roentgen\\n      pelvimetry is a sound procedure, particularly in pre-emptors patients, and\\n      should and should be considered as an indispensable aid in these cases.\\n      \\n The method of Herbert Thoms as\\n      developed at Yale Medical School is not the only method. However, it can\\n      be classified as simple, accurate and rapid; being adaptable for use by\\n      other than experts in x-ray and obstetric diagnosis. As a technical\\n      procedure a well trained hospital technician can master its technic alter\\n      sufficient instruction.\\n      \\n Studies of recent years reveal the fact\\n      that external Pelvimetry fails to give uniform and accurate information in\\n      regard to the shape and size of the superior strait. This is often true of\\n      thin undersized individuals. In many patients of this type external\\n      measurements may suggest a contracted pelvis while the x-ray will show a\\n      relatively large pelvis with a subsequent natural labor and normal-sized\\n      child. On the other hand a stocky short person with similar external\\n      measurements will disclose a contracted pelvis which is an obstetric\\n      problem. Because of the apparent relationship between shortening of the\\n      transverse diameter and a secondary persistent occipito-posterior\\n      presentation, accurate information regarding this diameter is of clinical\\n      significance.\\n      \\n The observations of Thomas were made on\\n      twenty consecutive patients whose pelvis showed a relative or real\\n      shortening of the transverse diameter of the superior strait. In every\\n      instance a primary or secondary occipito posterior position was found\\n      after the patient was in labor. (Herbert Thoms, Surgery, Gynecology and\\n      Obstetrics, January, 1933). It therefore has been proved that an actual or\\n      relative shortening of a transverse diameter of the superior strait\\n      results in a limitation of space that is greater in the anterior than in\\n      the posterior half of the superior strait. Under these circumstances, when\\n      the head descends early in labor, the occiput is forced to rotate\\n      posteriorly.\\n      \\n The x-ray offers additional information\\n      in determining the size of the fetal head. It has been noted in x-ray\\n      examination of the unengaged fetal head that it lay with the transverse\\n      diameter of the superior strait, the occiput being either to the right or\\n      left; therefore, if roentgenogram of the patient is taken in the supine\\n      position with the fetus in the uterus, it will cast a shadow which is an\\n      enlarged profile of the head. The measurements of the occipital frontal\\n      diameter of the head can then be made. On numerous occasions this method\\n      of cephalometry, determining the diameter of the unmoulded head before and\\n      after cesarean section, has yielded accurate results. (Thomas, A.M.A.,\\n      February 24, 1934).\\n      \\n As experience increases in roentgen\\n      pelvimetry, the so-called labor test will be employed less. This, however,\\n      does not mean that the physician should not under estimate the importance\\n      of uterine contraction and the ability of the fetal head to mold. It has\\n      always followed that when something could be proved desirable in medicine\\n      for the better protection of the patient, such an advance would be\\n      demanded and eventually become routine. We may concede, therefore, that\\n      roentgen pelvimetry has a distinct place in the examination of every\\n      primiparous woman. In many instances, according to Thomas and others,\\n      external; measurements were normal but the x-ray examination revealed a\\n      contracted pelvis. On the other had, in certain patients whose external\\n      measurements suggested a cesarean section roentgen pelvimetry proved\\n      otherwise and they were subsequently delivered in a normal manner.\\n      \\n CENTIMETER GRID METHOD.\\n      \\n The procedure in this method may be\\n      summarized by stating the following:.\\n      \\n (1) The patient is placed on the\\n      roentgenographic table in the semi- recumbent position.\\n      \\n (2) The level of the superior strait\\n      above the sensitized film is established.\\n      \\n (3) The tube target is centered about\\n      five centimeters posterior to the symphysis, at thirty-two inches from the\\n      sensitized film, The exposure is made.\\n      \\n (4) The patient is removed from the\\n      table, the tube target and sensitized film remaining in situ.\\n      \\n (5) A lead plate, or centimeter grid,\\n      with perforations exactly one centimeter apart, is introduced into the\\n      same plane as that previously occupied by the superior strait and a second\\n      (flash) exposure is made on the same sensitized film as was used used in\\n      the previous exposure.\\n      \\n (6) Development of the film shows the\\n      outline of the superior strait and the shadows of the perforations, the\\n      assistance between which represents centimeters in the plane of the\\n      superior strait. The anteroposterior and transverse diameters of the\\n      superior strait in its use proportions may be drawn on centimeter-square\\n      paper by following the course of the shadow of the superior strait and\\n      transcribing it.\\n      \\n As this time I wish to express my\\n      thanks to Dr. Thoms for his personal advice and instruction which helped\\n      me to master the technic of his method.'\n",

      " 'Tresorie - THE EFFICACY OF THE VIBROMETER IN APPLYING VIBRATORY MASSAGE\\nIN AURAL DISEASES [Efficacy Of Vibrometer In Applying Vibratory Message In Aural\\nDisease]\\n\\n SINCE presenting my paper before the\\n      American Institute, in June of last year on \"Vibratory Motion as a\\n      Method of Massage in Aural Diseases,\" I have been using an instrument\\n      specially devised for that purpose called the \"vibrometer.\" This\\n      instrument is in shape like a banjo, and has four strings stretched across\\n      its length resting on a bridge, which sets upon a diaphragm. On each side,\\n      elevated above the diaphragm and supported by posts, are two horizontal\\n      bars, which support the mechanical appliances used for producing the\\n      various vibratory motions. This consists in what is called a yoke, in\\n      which revolves a shaft connected with the electro-motor by pulley-wheels\\n      and a belt. Behind the diaphragm is a shallow air-tight compartment,\\n      leading from which are rubber tubes that are inserted in the external\\n      auditory canal during treatment, consequently any vibratory motion of the\\n      diaphragm, which must necessarily be an inward and a corresponding outward\\n      movement, would be exactly reproduced upon the membrana tympani, as the\\n      confined air, not being able to escape, will undergo an alternate\\n      condensation and rarefication in the external auditory canal.\\n      \\n Every vibratory movement of the strings\\n      of the instrument is communicated to the diaphragm by means of the bridge\\n      upon which it rests. These strings by varying their tension and length can\\n      be regulated to give a high or low rate of vibration as desired, for\\n      instance, the heaviest string left at its original length adjusted to a\\n      slight tension may make about fifty vibratory motions to the second, while\\n      the highest string on the instrument adjusted to a high tension and\\n      clamped down to one-fourth its original length would probably make three\\n      thousand vibratory motions to the second.\\n      \\n In the centre of the diaphragm is an\\n      attachment which works on a lever, and when hit by the cam on the\\n      revolving shaft lifts the diaphragm to a considerable extent, causing a\\n      powerful effect on the membrana tympani. This attachment can be adjusted\\n      at four different leverages, which causes a modification or increase of\\n      its intensity and can be regulated at from one to twenty-five vibratory\\n      movements to the second. This is only used in very bad cases and for not\\n      more than five minutes continuously.\\n      \\n The instrument which I have been\\n      describing in an improvement on the first manufactured, and as far as I\\n      know, is the only one which offers the same facilities for applying this\\n      method of massage. The class of patients in my experience who are\\n      generally benefited from the first, are those in which the mucous membrane\\n      lining the tympanic cavity and Eustachian tubes is in a hypertrophic\\n      condition. The membrana tympani are depressed, opaque, and thickened. They\\n      usually complain of a stiffed sensation in the ears, with a great deal of\\n      tinnitus aurium, and that their hearing is worse during a cold. In cases\\n      where the mucous membranes are atrophied with a large external auditory\\n      canal perfectly dry and Eustachian tubes patulous, and generally very\\n      little tinnitus, this or no other treatment has done very much good in the\\n      majority of cases, and in looking ever my records I find that only about\\n      five per cent. have been relieved, while in the before-mentioned cases the\\n      good results reach at least seventy-five per cent. In treating persons, I\\n      always select the rate of vibration which corresponds in pitch, if\\n      possible, to that caused by the diseased condition of the ears. If there\\n      is no tinnitus to guide me, I find whether the patient can hear a high or\\n      low sound better; if it is a low sound, a high rate of vibration is used\\n      in treatment, and vice versa, A point which I would like to explain here\\n      is this: It is not necessary that the sound from the instrument should be\\n      of the same quality of the tinnitus experienced by the patient, but merely\\n      the same pitch. for instance, if a banjo, where one of the strings was\\n      adjusted when sounded to produce a certain note, and a musical instrument\\n      of any other kind, whose quality of tone was entirely different, was made\\n      to sound the same note in a room, the string on the banjo would vibrate in\\n      sympathy, which has been proven by experiment, any other note, no matter\\n      how loud, would have no effect. Another point is in the way the strings of\\n      the vibrometer are set in motion. On the revolving shaft is a wheel\\n      projecting from which are metallic picks which hit the string it is\\n      adjusted over. It does not make any difference in the number of vibratory\\n      motions per second, whether the string is hit fast or slow, but at the\\n      time the string is first hit the intensity is greater than it is just\\n      before being hit again, and as the motion of the wheel is perfectly\\n      rhythmic, revolving so many times to the second, it has just as good an\\n      effect as if the intensity during the fraction of a second did not vary at\\n      all. The idea of using vibratory motion, as I have said before, originated\\n      within my mind some years ago, and later put into practical operation, and\\n      as far as I know, was the first to lay before the profession in a\\n      scientific manner, this method of massage.\\n      \\n I have found that when two of the\\n      strings upon the vibrometer were regulated in such a way that when both\\n      were set in vibration at the same time, producing the sensation of a\\n      harmonious sound, the effect in some cases on the tinnitus was especially\\n      beneficial, relieving, where the various kinds of vibrations produced by a\\n      single string failed. Sub-acute cases of deafness, accompanied by tinnitus\\n      aurium, are quickly relieved, as the following case will illustrate:.\\n      \\n Mrs. M. Young, married lady, aet. 26,\\n      called at my office, April 1, 1893, complaining of partial deafness and\\n      tinnitus aurium. She had a stuffed sensation, or as if cotton had been\\n      packed in the external auditory canal. She says the tinnitus was so\\n      annoying as to prevent sleep. On examination, found considerable\\n      retraction of the membrana tympani, and hearing for the watch, on the\\n      right side five inches, on the left, seven inches. The Eustachian tube\\n      were partially closed, which made inflation somewhat difficult, giving\\n      slight relief. I used several of the vibrations on the different strings\\n      without immediate benefit.\\n      \\n April 4th.-She came again, and reported\\n      that no improvement had taken place. I again inflated her ears, after\\n      which she sat down to the vibrometer. The central attachment was used with\\n      considerable force continuously for four minutes, after which she declared\\n      that the tinnitus had entirely ceased in the right ear, and greatly\\n      modified in the left; the hearing for the watch had increased for both\\n      ears to fourteen inches, and the stuffed sensation had almost entirely\\n      disappeared. On inspection of the membrana tympani, found them\\n      comparatively very slightly retracted. On April 8th, found improvement had\\n      continued, when the same treatment was used for three minutes; after which\\n      she declared herself completely relieved of the tinnitus and stuffed\\n      sensation, with hearing powerfully restored. Saw her again on April 13th,\\n      when she declared the good results from last treatment to have still\\n      continued.\\n      \\n I find that in the majority of cases,\\n      when the strings of the instrument are used it is only necessary to strike\\n      them lightly with the friction wheel. In vibrating the heavy string, I\\n      generally set the bridge back behind the central attachment, and adjusting\\n      the motor in such way that the belt is at a considerable tension, so that\\n      the pulley-wheel revolves slowly. I also generally use this adjustment\\n      when setting in motion two strings at one time. The principle of this\\n      method of treatment embraces two essential features which to my mind makes\\n      this system of massage the only scientific one applicable to the membrana\\n      tympani and its associate sound-conducting parts. Message is the\\n      application of motion to disease, and its scientific administration\\n      consists of its application in a systematic manner. In applying massage in\\n      aural diseases, it is necessary to produce a to-and-fro movement of the\\n      membrana tympani, and, if possible, by a force which is harmless and at\\n      the same time effective. The vibrometer fulfils these conditions. Any of\\n      the strings on the instrument that may be set in motion by the\\n      friction-wheel, will produce a certain number of vibratory movements to\\n      the second of time, and the movements of the central attachment are also\\n      measured. What could be more systematic than this? The motions of the\\n      membrana tympani were intended by nature to its vibratory, and as the\\n      vibrometer generates measured motion, and these motions are vibratory,\\n      theoretically we have a scientific and effective method of massage in\\n      aural diseases; and, as demonstrated practically by the use of the\\n      vibrometer, we have in fact a great scientific advance over all previous\\n      methods. Since the introduction of this treatment in aural diseases, it\\n      makes possible a more or less benefit in cases of deafness heretofore\\n      considered hopeless, and has opened up the field for the treatment of\\n      aural diseases to such an extent that the number of deaf patients seeking\\n      relief at the aurist\\'s hands will at least double itself.\\n      \\n DISCUSSION.\\n      \\n H.C. HOUGHTON, M.D.: Dr. Garey\\'s\\n      admirable paper gives us the description of the vibrometer, an instrument\\n      devised under his personal direction and inspection, for the purpose of\\n      applying massage to the ear. It is the only instrument of the kind on the\\n      market, so far as I am aware, and after a somewhat prolonged use of it, I\\n      am prepared to recommend the latest production of the vibrometer company.\\n      \\n This instrument is a decided\\n      improvement over the instrument first sent out, and is capable of\\n      producing a most profound effect upon the drum-head and ossicula; indeed,\\n      upon the entire auditory apparatus. I am able to confirm Dr. Garey\\'s\\n      statement of the effect of high and low vibrations us regards treatment.\\n      \\n I have also been very much interested\\n      in the use of stringed or reed instruments for diagnosis, and find that we\\n      can detect any abnormal sensitiveness of the auditory nerve to high or low\\n      tones. Some patients are extremely sensitive to all tones, high or low;\\n      others to high tones and not to low tones; others, conversely. Again, in\\n      some instances, there is a peculiar sensitiveness to single tones or to\\n      discords produced by sounding the note and half-note at the same time.\\n      Under the action of the central attachment of the vibrometer this\\n      sensitiveness is modified, the sensitiveness to high tones disappearing\\n      and being replaced by a low tone or, conversely, under treatment, a low\\n      tone disappears and a high tone is established, temporarily, at least.\\n      Again, in cases of recent origin, treatment will substitute an undefined\\n      rushing sound for a definite musical tone, either high or low, and later,\\n      the treatment will abolish this, the patient being relieved of this\\n      intensely annoying symptom. In some cases, with this relief, there is an\\n      improvement in the audition; in other cases, no improvement follows.\\n      \\n I confess to the domination of the\\n      material over my mind in my earlier experience with massage, and I think\\n      the inclination of operators will be to use a far greater degree of power\\n      than is necessary. I therefore notice with great satisfaction Professor\\n      Garey\\'s remark that \"the object should be to produce a to-and-fro\\n      motion to the membrana tympani, and, if possible, by a force which is\\n      harmless and at the same time effective.\" I would hardly say\\n      \"to-and-fro motion of the drum-head,\" because I think that the\\n      expression is liable to perpetuate the motion which is fixed in the minds\\n      of most physiologists, that the drum-head moves as a whole, with a\\n      to-and-fro motion.\" That is true under the influence of the Politzer,\\n      Siegle\\'s otoscope and similar instruments; but it certainly does not so\\n      move in the ordinary function of audition, but stands as the iris does in\\n      the eye, as an adjustor, a regulator of sound-force; in some sense as the\\n      iris does in its relation with the lens, to adjust, regulate and direct\\n      the essential force, and the vibration of the drum-head is at every node;\\n      every portion receives impressions that are converted into molecular\\n      disturbances of varying lengths, according as they are produced upon the\\n      stiff and unyielding portions of the drum-head at the periphery, along the\\n      manubrium, or in the more attenuated and easily-yielding portions which\\n      the between these two areas. Not only so, but these impulses are\\n      communicated to the contained air of the tympanum, and make their\\n      impression upon the acoustic nerve through the round window synchronously\\n      with the impression made through the ossicula.\\n      \\n This whole subject widens before my\\n      mind in such a way that one might wish himself twenty years and at liberty\\n      to devote himself to a term of research in acoustics, such as is offered\\n      only in the technical schools of the continent of Europe.\\n      \\n WM. R. KING, M.D.: In discussing Dr.\\n      Garey\\'s paper I shall begin by saying that his methods have been closely\\n      followed by me since the beginning of his experiments, owing to the fact\\n      that I have been greatly interested in the treatment of deafness and\\n      tinnitus by means of sound waves or by aural massage since 1887, and have\\n      experimented and treated many cases by this method since then, though with\\n      crude and unsatisfactory instruments. Since using the vibrometer-which,\\n      after much study and experimentation, is now presented to the profession\\n      in practical shape-I have undoubtedly increased my percentage of good\\n      results.\\n      \\n I don\\'t believe I am over-sanguine or\\n      carried away by interest in this method, and believe I can rightly\\n      appreciate that this does not offer us a panacea or cure-all for auditory\\n      ailments, and hope I may always be ready to see the failures and to strive\\n      to find methods or remedies to reach some of them.\\n      \\n In speaking of the application of the\\n      instrument, I wish to call attention to the central attachment or post foe\\n      vibrations. Dr. Garey has not given it as much attention in the paper as\\n      it deserves. It is very useful as a general means of aural massage,\\n      rougher in nature and more general in application than the strings which\\n      help to make up the instrument. I often use it before applying the\\n      \"similar found\" to a given case, as a species of gymnastics, to\\n      stimulate secretion and motion in the conducting apparatus of the ear,\\n      viz., membrana tympani and ossicles. In most cases-in fact, in all-where\\n      tinnitus is present, I follow this up immediately by the nearest approach\\n      to the similar pitch obtainable.\\n      \\n I agree thoroughly with Dr. Garey, that\\n      the best results are achieved in cases accompanying hypertrophic catarrh,\\n      and that the least benefit is apparent in cases of atrophic nature.\\n      \\n Regarding the method of treatment in\\n      the absence of tinnitus, my experience the does not coincide with that of\\n      the author of the paper entirely; I do not feel that as yet we have any\\n      safe rule to guide us. My method has been to try the numerous sounds and\\n      variations the of until I find the one that seems to give the best\\n      immediate results, or that the patient himself will speak of as very\\n      penetrating and powerful )though not necessarily loud and heavy).\\n      \\n It seems almost impossible at present\\n      to simulate all the qualities of tone as they occur in the ears of those\\n      suffering with tinnitus; in fact, it would appear to be unnecessary.\\n      However, it seems advantageous and quite necessary to secure the closest\\n      simulation of pitch, thus in many cases soon obliterating annoying\\n      tinnitus and improving hearing powers.\\n      \\n The arrangement permitting of the\\n      picking of two strings simultaneously adds decidedly the usefulness of the\\n      instrument, as it increases the range of pitch as well as varying the\\n      quality of tones procurable, thereby decidedly enlarging our field of\\n      application.\\n      \\n The force used for creating the message\\n      or gymnastics of the membrana tympani and the ossicles-viz, vibratory\\n      force or sound- carefully and scientifically applied, is nature\\'s remedy,\\n      because it is adapted by nature, and is the only force which can rightly\\n      or safely be applied to these delicate portions of this complex organ of\\n      hearing.\\n      \\n A startling commentary on this subject\\n      is the array of cases benefited who have been relegated to the shelf by\\n      ancient and modern otology; cases declared unhelpable have been vastly\\n      improved. Pray, make no mistake; I did not say all cases.\\n      \\n It may be interesting to hear the\\n      latest regarding the instrument which was first invented for the\\n      application of this method of aural massage Mr. E.J. Godman, the inventor\\n      and patentee, is constantly on the lookout, and always striving for\\n      improvements to his machine. He has made many that you all know of. Permit\\n      me to report a few so recent they have not yet left the factory.\\n      \\n First.-The machine has been taken from\\n      its case, and is now mounted on a solid stand or table of oak, being set\\n      below the level, or so that the face of the instrument is just level with\\n      the face of the table. This is all supported by rigid, solid metal legs,\\n      which absolutely prevent foreign vibrations.\\n      \\n Second.-The motor has been removed from\\n      its little shelf and relegated below the table. I t can be placed upon a\\n      box on the floor, a shelf against the wall, or, better yet, a shelf\\n      solidly attached to the metal supports of the table. A belt goes up\\n      through an aperture to a wheel on a shaft, the other extremity of which\\n      carries a wheel with a rubber tire (a friction wheel), which in its\\n      revolution, being in contact with a larger flat- surfaced wheel on the\\n      main shaft of the instrument, turns this in harmony with itself. This\\n      arrangement does away with the necessity of shifting the motor each time\\n      you wish to shift the carriage from one string to another- a consummation\\n      to be devoutly thankful for. The removal of the motor from the instrument\\n      as at present attached will recommend itself to all who have used the\\n      vibrometer, a great amount of undesirable jar being thus avoided.\\n      \\n Third.-Ratchet keys capable of very\\n      fine adjustment of tension of strings are now provided for the instrument.\\n      \\n Fourth.-A rheostadt or resistance-coil\\n      is now to be placed beneath the table between the storage battery and the\\n      switch, by this means enabling us to control the speed and number of\\n      revolutions to a nicety.\\n      \\n Other, though comparatively minor,\\n      improvements are being made, and others are contemplated, as, for\\n      instance, the substitution of a roughly corrugated rubber band for the\\n      picker on the wheel, thereby getting rid of the metallic sound of the\\n      picker on the wire strings.\\n      \\n I have experimented with a number of\\n      appliance for the production of the sounds and pitches that I have\\n      required, but I always fall back on the vibrometer, especially as at\\n      present constructed, for satisfactory work and results.\\n      \\n This instrument may be, and probably\\n      is, as yet, in its infancy. It, and the method it applies, can only be\\n      perfected by constant work and experimentation both on the part of the\\n      profession and of the manufacturers. Each improvement we can suggest, if\\n      it only should serve as a means of helping one solitary case, would be\\n      well worth our while.\\n      \\n The experiments being made by different\\n      methods for treating deafness by sound waves is indicative of the interest\\n      the profession has taken in the matter. It is indicative of a lack of\\n      something in our usual armamentarium which is greatly longed for by\\n      patient and doctor; that is, the means for making the deaf hear and for\\n      relieving distressing tinnitus. There has been a dearth in this direction,\\n      and perhaps there still is, but I believe fully that we have in aural\\n      massage by vibratory force a decided acquisition at our hands.\\n      \\n E. H. LINNELL., M.D.: I would simply\\n      like to ask Dr. King how long he uses the instrument, and whether he uses\\n      it according to the deafness.\\n      \\n DR. KING: Yes, decidedly. In an intense\\n      case of deafness I would have to use it a great deal longer. The central\\n      attachment I never carry over three or five minutes, and the whole\\n      treatment I don\\'t think is over carried over twenty or twenty-five minutes\\n      in one case, and usually averages from ten to fifteen.\\n      \\n HAROLD WILSON, M.D.: I have only to\\n      suggest, what I have elsewhere called attention to, the possibility of\\n      another mechanical device for securing vibratory motion. It is well known\\n      that in the make and break of a current of electricity, in the circuit of\\n      which there is a telephone, we get an influence upon the make and break of\\n      the current in the telephone. Now, it is a simple matter with which these\\n      makes and breaks are made as to obtaining any number of vibration that you\\n      wish. You may, by a mechanical device of some rotary motion, if you\\n      choose, make and break the current as rapidly as you please until you have\\n      reached several thousand vibrations a second, or you may even make the\\n      vibrations so slow us to be easily counted. The application of this\\n      suggestion has been put in force in my own practice, more or less, in the\\n      use of the telephone as connected with the induction-coil ordinary\\n      battery. The more intense the current, the more intense the sound. You can\\n      easily see that it is mere question of mechanics to secure these two\\n      sounds-intensity of vibration and rapidity of vibration. I will say,\\n      furthermore, that it has this advantage. There is no noise in the office,\\n      which I think is not altogether true of the vibrometer. I would suggest\\n      that so far as the vibrometer is concerned, if it could be made to be\\n      noiseless to anybody but the patient, it would be a decided improvement.\\n      In that respect the telephone is a decided improvement, because there is\\n      no noise except to the patient, because the noise is right at the ear of\\n      the patient. If I were seeking for a perfected instrument in this line, I\\n      would go outside of the banjo idea. As we have the most perfect writing\\n      machines, which have no connection with the ordinary method of writing,\\n      and sewing machines, which have no connection with sewing by hand, so it\\n      occurs to me that possibly the securing of he vibratory motion upon the\\n      ears might be obtained in a totally different way from that which you get\\n      when you listen to the drum of the guitar or an ordinary musical\\n      instrument, and I would suggest that the make and break of a telephone\\n      open a very fruitful field for mechanical experimentation.\\n      \\n H.C. HOUGHTON, M.D.: In my study of\\n      this subject I made the acquaintance of Mr. Bernhardt, of New York City,\\n      who is a personal friend of Mr. Emil Berliner, the inventor of the Emil\\n      Berliner Telephone, which is the instrument by which the Bell Telephone\\n      Company maintain their monopoly at present. Mr. Berliner is the inventor\\n      of the graphophone, and has, I think, covered this whole matter which Dr.\\n      Wilson has mentioned. As ordinary Bell telephone receiver is put into the\\n      circuit of an ordinary induction machine, and you can use it just as the\\n      English people use the audiometer, and as you remove the coil you modify\\n      the vibrations, which is covered with another disk and a tube, and that\\n      tube covered with a stethoscope tube, which is the same as we use for the\\n      phonograph or vibrometer, and, as Dr. Wilson has suggested, you can modify\\n      the intensity, and of course the whole matter is adjusted by the\\n      attachment of the cord, so that you can have fine vibrations. The\\n      intensity of the vibrations is regulated by the distance to which you\\n      uncover the cord. The only difficulty in the adjustment is that it has\\n      been so severe that it is really uncomfortable, and the noise of the\\n      instrument is reduced to the minimum for office use.\\n      \\n A.B. NORTON, M.D.: I will also add that\\n      in regard to the objection Dr. Wilson makes to the noise, there is no\\n      doubt it is an annoying thing in the office, and in that line I have some\\n      men at work on my suggestion. We are devising another machine, or\\n      instrument, which is to be entirely enclosed in a cabinet, so there will\\n      be no noise whatever in the room if it is made a success. The idea is a\\n      little crude, and I am quite uncertain whether it will amount to anything\\n      or not. Then, in the line of what Dr. King was speaking in regard to Mr.\\n      Goodwin-he called, at New York, to see me last week. I made two little\\n      suggestion to him, which I think would be in line with his advancement.\\n      One is the number of the picks. The present vibrometer has four picks I\\n      suggest the experiment of trying twelve or sixteen picks, which will make\\n      a more continuous sound; it may be of some value. Then, in regard to\\n      regulating the speed of the machine: you regulate that now by a series of\\n      buttons, so as to get three different speeds. We will have a very slight,\\n      intermediate speed, and a very rapid speed. My experience with the\\n      vibrometer is especially favorable. I think the idea is in the right\\n      direction, and it is simply a matter of instrumentation.']\n",

Dietary sources of vitamin C include fruits and vegetables, particularly citrus fruits such as oranges.Severe deficiency of vitamin C causes scurvy. Although rare, scurvy results in severe symptoms and can cause death. People with scurvy are treated with vitamin C and should be under medical supervision.Many uses for vitamin C have been proposed, but evidence of benefit in scientific studies is lacking. In particular, research on asthma, cancer, and diabetes remains inconclusive, and a lack of benefit has been found for the prevention of cataracts or heart disease.The use of vitamin C in the prevention or treatment of colds remains controversial. Extensive research has been conducted. Overall, vitamin C lacked an effect on the development of colds and on cold symptoms. However, the duration of the cold shortened slightly. Notably, people living in extreme circumstances, including soldiers in the subarctic, skiers, and marathon runners, had a 50% decrease in the risk of developing a cold. This area merits additional research and may be of particular interest to athletes or people in the military.'\n",

Vitamin B12 is frequently used in combination with other B vitamins in a vitamin B complex formulation. Vitamin B12 is important in DNA synthesis. Vitamin B12 is bound to the protein in food. Acid in the stomach releases B12 from protein during digestion. Once released, B12 combines with a substance called intrinsic factor (IF) before it is absorbed into the bloodstream.The human body stores several years\\' worth of vitamin B12 in the liver, so low levels in the body are rare. Decreases in vitamin B12 levels are more common in the elderly, HIV-infected persons, and vegetarians. Inability to absorb vitamin B12 from the intestinal tract can cause a type of anemia called pernicious anemia. Fever and symptoms of \"excessive sweating\" have been reported with anemia due to low levels of vitamin B12; however, these are fixed with vitamin B12 treatment.'\n",

This is based on results. They are not\\n      hopeless cases; they are still hopeful and they get well under\\n      radiotherapy. This has happened during the last three years, not because I\\n      have changed any but because the method of radiotherapy has changed. A\\n      great change has taken place. First of all, radium and x-rays are no\\n      longer looked on a last resort.\".\\n      \\n The foregoing bears witness to the\\n      progress made in the field radiation therapy. The manufacture of more\\n      adequate apparatus and the improved technic in its use reflect this\\n      improvement. Machines are used generally delivering twenty to thirty\\n      milliamperes of current at 200 K.V., while machines operating at 750 to\\n      1,000 200 K.V., using lower milliamperes, have been installed in several\\n      places in this country. Since the question of increased voltages began to\\n      dominate the field, machines operating at 400 to 600 K.V., using sealed\\n      tubes, have been manufactured in this country as well as on the been\\n      manufactured in this country as well as on the continent. This higher\\n      powered machines occupy little more space than the usual 200 K.V. machine.\\n      \\n The effectiveness of these stronger\\n      radiations is thought to be due to (1) the increased penetration and its\\n      consequently larger percentage depth doses, (2) the supposed higher\\n      selective action of short have length radiation on malignant cells, and\\n      (3) greatly increased x-ray output. Clinics using super-voltages report\\n      that clinical results are somewhat better than those secured through the\\n      use of the lesser voltage machine.\\n      \\n Experimental effort, from the physical\\n      and biologic point of view, has been exerted to establish to standard\\n      basis for radiotherapy since Roentgens discovery thirtyfive years ago, and\\n      its application five years later. Radiotherapists have only recently begun\\n      to understand the principles of clinical application or radiotherapy in\\n      the treatment of malignant conditions.\\n      \\n Regaud selected the rabbits testicle\\n      for his experiments because its histologic cellular structure was highly\\n      sensitive to radiation, containing cells which are in a state of active\\n      mitosis resembling that of malignant tissue. In 1922, Regaud reported that\\n      of malignant, tissue. In 1922, Regaud reported that it was impossible to\\n      sterilize the testicle by a single dose of radiation without causing\\n      serious damage to the overlying skin. The dose required to produced such\\n      radio necrosis was equivalent to about three radionecrosis was equivalent\\n      to about three erythemas when administered in one dose. However, by\\n      dividing the dose in such a manner as to prolong the treatment over a\\n      period of fourteen days, a total dose of about five erythemas could be\\n      given causing complete sterilizations without damage to the skin. Thus it\\n      is seen that by prolonging the time of treatment the cutaneous dose could\\n      be increased nearly 50 per cent without causing necrosis.\\n      \\n The above experiments were reported,\\n      and the same results determined, by Schinz and Slotopolsky in 1926, and\\n      again by Regaud and Ferroux in 1927. These experiments formed the\\n      foundation for the clinical studies of Pfahler (America), Hohlfelder\\n      (Germany) and Coutard (France), who have swung the pendulum from massive\\n      radiation, as advocated by the German school, to that of the protected\\n      fractional dose method. Results have been achieved by this method which\\n      are superior to previously reported; these are obtained by the improved\\n      method of administering a large dose to the (3 days) without causing\\n      destructive effects to the surroundings normal structure (or cancer bed);\\n      its effect are rather biologic than physical. The clinical application of\\n      the method of radiation by Pfahler, Countard, and Berven (Sweden) in the\\n      treatment of cancer of the tonsil, pharynx and larynx and have proved the\\n      radio-sensitive properties of squamous carcinoma, previously considered\\n      incapable of of responding to radiation.\\n      \\n According to Coutard, the neoplasm is\\n      exposed to x-rays twice daily, giving a total dose of 350 r to400 r to two\\n      areas, using 190 to 200 k.v., four milliamperes, two millimeters of copper\\n      and three millimeters of aluminum filtration at a distance of fifty of\\n      sixty centimeters, for lesion of the head and neck. For deeply situated\\n      lesions, such as cancer of the uterus, the focal distance varies from 80\\n      to 100 centimeters, the area of the field for the head and neck conditions\\n      being only 50 to 100 square centimeters, while those of the lower abdomen\\n      require on an average of 250 to 300 square centimeters. For the\\n      sterilization of the radio-sensitive squamous carcinomatous growth, a\\n      depth dose of 3,000 r to 4,000 r is given, while stronger dose is\\n      necessary for the radio-resistant tumors.\\n      \\n In the course of treatment of principle\\n      guides a radio reaction of the covering epithelium and the radio reaction\\n      of the cancer cells. The radio reaction of the cutaneous epithelium is\\n      called \"radio epidermitis.\"characterized by loss of epithelial\\n      layers and denudation of the dermis. The reaction of the mucous membrane ,\\n      called \"radio epithelitis,\" manifests itself by loss of the\\n      epithelial layer sand denudation of the mucous membrane, epithelial layers\\n      and denudation of the corium which becomes covered by a fibrinous and\\n      false membrane; of clear. The duration of both describe radio reactions is\\n      six weeks. Each appears at the beginning of three weeks and disappears at\\n      the beginning of the ninth week.\\n      \\n Should the total or daily dose or the\\n      intensity per minute be too high, or the filtration or the tension too\\n      low, the cancer bed would be modified. the nutrition of the malignant\\n      cells becomes impaired The cellular radio- sensitivity, which seems to be\\n      linked up not only with the mitosis of the cell but above all with the\\n      activity of their interchange with the cell but above all with the\\n      activity of their interchange with the surrounding normal structures,\\n      becomes diminished and at times suppressed. The cancer cells become\\n      incentive to radiation. This phenomenon is called \"radio-\\n      vaccination\" by Regaud.\\n      \\n Observation of clinical facts shows\\n      that changes in the surrounding normal tissue result from excessive daily\\n      doses and intensity per minute per minute causing radio resistance of the\\n      tissue. Conversely, radio- sensitivity would be prolonged with a smaller\\n      daily dosage and the resultant extended period.\\n      \\n Realizing that better results may be\\n      obtained by prolonged treatment, Coutard and his collaborators in the last\\n      few years have begun to extend the duration of treatment of certain\\n      so-called radio-resistant cancers from thirty to ninety days, giving weak\\n      daily doses in order of about 175, 220, 225 and 250 r per day, dividing\\n      the dose in two treatments. By this method he was able to cure a certain\\n      number of lesions on which he had not been able previously to obtain the\\n      same results, such as very differentiated epidermoid epithelioma invading\\n      the muscles and cartilages, glandular epithelioma of the breast ad the\\n      thyroid body, and special round celled epitheliomas of the upper part of\\n      the ethmoid and the adjacent sinuses. This mode of prolonged treatment not\\n      only controlled the condition locally but it lessened the frequency of\\n      metastasis.\\n      \\n When radiating a cancer of very\\n      embryonic, very radio-sensitive growths, the energy factor is predominant.\\n      The action of the x-rays seems to be direct and rapid; the treatment can\\n      be accomplished within fifteen to twenty days. The cells are destroyed and\\n      generally normal structures are affected very little. When radiating the\\n      less embryonic type of growths, the time of treatment should be longer.\\n      \\n Pursuing these general principles, I\\n      have adopted the Countard method with some slight modifications. The cures\\n      which I shall illustrate will show that the percentage of cures in a\\n      number of most dangerous epidermoid carcinomas has markedly increased and\\n      that some conditions formerly considered hopeless have been temporarily\\n      cured. In conclusion I wish to emphasize the following facts:.\\n      \\n (1) Cure of cancer by x-rays is still\\n      difficult and must not be entered into lightly and causally.\\n      \\n (2) Radiotherapy is just as radical in\\n      method as surgery, and requires great skill, judgment and experience.\\n      \\n (3) The cooperation of the pathologist\\n      and the radiotherapist is imperative for a proper estimate of the\\n      radio-sensitivity in relation to treatment of the lesion.\\n      \\n (4) Daily examination of the patient is\\n      necessary; modification of the normal structure and general reaction by\\n      the x-ray treatment sometimes appears to quickly that it is often\\n      necessary to diminish the daily dose or the size of the field in the\\n      course of treatment.\\n      \\n (5) There exists no fixed method of\\n      treatment, only a simple clinical treatment for each individual patient\\n      and for the special type of tumor..\\n      \\n (6) Improvement in roentgen apparatus\\n      of higher voltages, producing more penetrating rays, will permit a better\\n      relation between destruction of malignant cells and preservation of the\\n      supporting, and the radio sensitivity of the tumor may be prolonged.'\n",
      " 'Tresorie - ALL INDIA HOMOEOPATHIC CONVENTION WELCOME ADDRESS [All India\\nHomoeopathic Convention Welcome Address]\\n\\n Mr. President, Friends and Colleagues.\\n      \\n It fills my heart with joy unspeakable\\n      to extend a hearty welcome to you all to this city at this All India\\n      Homoeopathic Convention held on the occasion of Bi-centennial Birth-day\\n      Anniversary of our great Master Hahnemann. This is the city where\\n      Homoeopathy was first introduced by Rajendra Lal Dutta of hallowed memory,\\n      who spent a princely fortune for dissemination of its principles and\\n      practice among his countrymen. This is the city where took place the\\n      dramatic conversion of one of the then medical luminaries of the first\\n      magnitude, to the practice of Homoeopathy under the influence of Rajendra\\n      Lal. I mean Dr. Mahendra Lal Sircar who became the high priest of\\n      Homoeopathy, spread its glory far and wide and gained thereby an\\n      international reputation for himself. This is the city where the\\n      celebrities of Homoeopathy like Dr. Berigny, Dr. Salzar, Dr. P.C.\\n      Majumdar, Dr. D. N. Roy. Dr. Younan, Dr. J.N. Majumdar, Dr. Baridbaran\\n      Mukherji, Dr. S.K. Nag, Dr. A.N. Mukherji, Dr. T.N. Palit, Dr. G.\\n      Dirghangi and a host of other talented physicians practised their\\n      profession with credit and success and held aloft the banner of\\n      Homoeopathy. This is the city where exist pioneer institutions for the\\n      teaching of Homoeopathy. This is the city wherefrom Homoeopathy has spread\\n      to all parts of India and its votaries are doing yeomans service for the\\n      good of the suffering humanity.\\n      \\n We are meeting this evening on a\\n      historic occasion and we have to arrive at decisions which might make or\\n      mar the future history of Homoeopathy in India. It may be that forces of\\n      disruption, destruction and obstruction are at work; it may be that self\\n      and vested interests seem to thwart the smooth progress of Homoeopathy; it\\n      may be that some may seem to play in the hands of the Powers that are not\\n      too sympathetic to the cause of Homoeopathy; it may be that the present\\n      seems to be chaotic and future of Homoeopathy dubious but great is truth\\n      indeed and will prevail. We should not lose heart or throw up the sponge.\\n      Tradition, authority, sectarianism, dogmatism are great obstacles on the\\n      way. But obstacles and difficulties are meant to be fought out and\\n      overcome. Strifes and dissensions, discords and disunities may hamper our\\n      progress but they are nonetheless signs of lifes activities. It is a good\\n      augury that the Homoeopathic profession is shaking off its age - long\\n      slumber and getting more and more conscious of its duties and obligation,\\n      its rights and privileges and of its short - comings and practical\\n      difficulties. The life of Hahnemann is there to encourage us; the\\n      masterful will of his dynamic spirit is there to inspire us to intensify\\n      our activities; his achievements are there to goad us to realise greater\\n      success; and his personality is always before us to take lessons from, in\\n      our life which as Swami Vivekananda puts it, is \"a process of\\n      unfolding and development of a being under circumstances tending to press\\n      it down.\"\\n      \\n That Homoeopathy is a scientific system\\n      of treatment, philosophically sound, logically unimpeachable, practically\\n      highly efficacious in curing the sick and cheap enough to suit the poor\\n      economic condition of the Indian masses - has become a much talked - of\\n      subject in the country. But why is it not spreading sufficiently and\\n      adequately in our motherland or in fact anywhere in the world? Why is our\\n      National Government not still keen on according official recognition to\\n      this superb system of healing art or providing ways and means for its\\n      development and diffusion? Why the public opinion is not gaining strength\\n      enough to put sufficient pressure on our Government to take interest in\\n      it? Why sufficient number of fully equipped Homoeopathic teaching\\n      institutions and hospitals are not growing to turn out adequate number of\\n      fully qualified Homoeopathic physicians in the country?\\n      \\n It is high time that we should draw the\\n      attention of the profession and the laity to provide answers to so many\\n      \"whys\" and to solve the pressing problems in the matter\\n      concerned. On a cursory view it becomes evident that the Homoeopathic\\n      profession, the people and the Government are each individually and\\n      collectively responsible for this impasse.\\n      \\n The so - called Allopathy still\\n      occupies the dominant place in any country, even in the land of birth of\\n      Homoeopathy. It is no wonder that Homoeopathy, being a discovery of merely\\n      a century and a half still lags behind its rival shool. But it is a wonder\\n      of wonders that Homoeopathy has already encompassed the whole world within\\n      such a short period since it was ushered into existence by Hahnemann.\\n      History of man reveals that nowhere a new truth was accepted by him easily\\n      and readily, obsessed as he is with conservatism, tradition, authority and\\n      vested interests. Nonetheless the triumphant march of Homoeopathy with a\\n      such a meteoric speed throughout the length and breadth of the world is a\\n      proof positive of the truth inherent in the system and phenomenal\\n      therapeutic efficacy of this healing art. It is one more glaring instance\\n      of mans love of truth against heavy odds that impede his progress at every\\n      step.\\n      \\n For the propagation of any new truth\\n      and its acceptance by man, in general, the first and foremost condition is\\n      the turning out of sufficient number of persons who have realised the\\n      truth and are adept in the practice of it. This involves establishment of\\n      a sufficient number of teaching institutions which will turn out experts\\n      in the science and art of Homoeopathy; and a sufficient number of\\n      Homoeopathic Hospital where, the efficacy of this system of treatment will\\n      be put to test.\\n      \\n Human knowledge is becoming\\n      unmanageably vast. The appearance of specialists has become indispensable.\\n      So special Hospitals for the treatment of specific types of diseases have\\n      sprung forth elsewhere, e.g. Tuberculosis Hospitals, Cancer Hospitals,\\n      Hospital for Tropical Diseases etc. Because of organisation of these\\n      hospitals people generally think of getting themselves treated in these\\n      institutions. As there are no fully - equipped general Homoeopathic\\n      Hospitals and not to speak of special Homoeopathic Hospitals and not to\\n      speak of special Homoeopathic Hospitals the result is Homoeopathy is not\\n      getting a fair chance of treating those diseases like tuberculosis,\\n      cancer, acute infectious diseases of epidemic type e.g., Small-pox,\\n      Cholera etc. on a large and organised scale. Consequently the general\\n      public cannot keep much faith in this treatment and mostly take recourse\\n      to homoeopathic treatment when the case is \"past all hope and past\\n      all surgery\". Hence the establishment of fully - equipped\\n      Homoeopathic institutions (College - cum - Hospitals) is an imperative\\n      necessity for enhancing the prestige of the Homoeopathic profession and\\n      for convincing the people about the therapeutic efficacy of this system of\\n      treatment. Is it not a pity that Homoeopathy once established its\\n      reputation by treating Cholera cases in this city and now nobody thinks of\\n      this treatment in Cholera cases and rushes the patient to the Allopathic\\n      Hospitals which are especially meant for these types of patients? How can\\n      we hope to gain ground under these circumstances?\\n      \\n The next great obstacle is the apathy\\n      and in many cases active antagonism of our Government, both at the Centre\\n      and at least in some of the State, towards Homoeopathy. The Government is\\n      under the thumb of its medical directorates which are solely manned by\\n      Allopathic doctors. The main reasons for the non - acceptance of the\\n      Homoeopathic system of treatment may be summed up in three words:\\n      tradition, authority and professionalism. Their psychology is easily\\n      understood if it is borne in mind that the conservative inertia of human\\n      mind attempts to reject any new thought will all the means at its\\n      disposal. Another reason is due to vested interests. Even a cursory glance\\n      at the history of origin and spread of Homoeopathy, enables one to find\\n      out that the opposition to this system from the start, was not scientific\\n      but rather of commercial nature on the part of the apothecaries who were\\n      afraid of losing their trade - profits. We regret to note that the Central\\n      Government have not yet implemented a single recommendation put forward by\\n      the Homoeopathic Enquiry Committee, Planning Commission. Third Health\\n      Ministers Conference, Ad Hoc Committee etc. though Homoeopathic Acts have\\n      been passed in the States of Bombay, U.P., Madhya Pradesh, Travancore -\\n      Cochin, Bihar etc. I is curious to note that W. Bengal is the only State\\n      where a Homoeopathic Bill has recently been thrown out by the State\\n      Government.\\n      \\n Another great obstacle is the\\n      psychology of the general mass of population who fail to adopt a proper\\n      philosophical attitude towards Homoeopathy and takes the Homoeopathic\\n      Therapeutic Law as great paradox contrary to common sense. Unless we can\\n      educate the public in the matter, we cannot hope to secure their whole -\\n      hearted support for this system of treatment.\\n      \\n Lack of enthusiasm for constructive\\n      works on the part of the Homoeopathic profession, the apathy of our\\n      Government and hesitancy on the part of the public to accept Homoeopathy\\n      are great obstacles to the spread of this system of treatment in the\\n      country. Unless this vicious circles is broken the progress of Homoeopathy\\n      is bound to be impeded. We have to fight on all fronts if we aspire to\\n      achieve victory in our battle for the cause of Homoeopathy and the\\n      suffering humanity.\\n      \\n But our first necessity as pointed out\\n      by the Soul of India expressing itself through Sri Aurobindo, is: If India\\n      is to survive and do her appointed work in the world, the youth of India\\n      should learn to think, to think on all subjects, to think independently,\\n      fruitfully, going to the heart of things, not stopped by their surface,\\n      free of pre - judgements, shearing sophism and prejudice asunder as with a\\n      sharp sword smiting down obscurantism of all kinds as with a mace of\\n      Bhima.\\n      \\n \"Let our brains no longer, like\\n      European infants, be swathed with swaddling clothes; let it have recover\\n      the free and unbound motion of the Gods, let it have not only the\\n      minuteness but the wide mastery and sovereignty natural to the intellect\\n      of Bharata and easily recoverable by it if it once accustomes itself to\\n      feel its own power and be convinced of its own worth.\\n      \\n \"The old fixed foundations have\\n      been broken up, we are tossing in the waters of a great upheaval and\\n      change. It is no use clinging to the old ice - floes of the past, they\\n      will soon melt and leave their refugees struggling in perilous waters. It\\n      is no use landing ourselves in the infirm bog, neither sea nor good, dry\\n      land of a second - hand Europeanism. We shall only die there a miserable\\n      and unclean death.\\n      \\n \"No we must learn to swim and use\\n      that power to reach the good vessel of unchanging truth; we must land\\n      again on the eternal rock of ages.\"\\n      \\n Yes, we must expand, we must assimilate\\n      whatever is assimilable for our growth. Stagnation and contraction are the\\n      signs of Death. Our knowledge must be aggressive, must diffuse through the\\n      rank and file of the whole Homoeopathic profession if we wish to survive\\n      and perpetuate ourselves; to leave an extensive ignorance either below or\\n      around us is to expose ourselves to the perpetual danger of being\\n      exterminated as a professional entity.\\n      \\n In fine, I welcome you, once again, on\\n      this historic occasion to this historic city to deliberate, to exchange\\n      view points and to come to agreed decisions with regard to our future line\\n      of action in respect of Homoeopathy in all its aspects.'\n",
      " 'Tresorie - SOME OBSERVATIONS ON NEURASTHENIA AND ITS TREATMENT\\n[Neurasthenia & Treatment]\\n\\n WHEN, thirty-five years ago, the writer\\n      first made the acquaintance of what is now called neurasthenia, it was\\n      known as spinal irritation, and the best of modern researches have been\\n      unable to give a better definition beyond a functional disturbance of the\\n      spinal and cerebral nerves, dependent on a morbid process, for which\\n      \"irritation\" is as proper a term as any. As deaths do not occur,\\n      autopsies throw no light on the subject. Briefly stated, neurasthenia,\\n      when observed from the beginning through its chronic course, has a period\\n      of prodromal symptoms followed by a protracted acute, and succeeded by a\\n      still more protracted chronic, state, between the end of which and the\\n      beginning of convalescence there is a very vague, often indiscernible,\\n      boundary line.\\n      \\n The prodromal symptoms are quite\\n      indefinite and very variable, pointing to nothing in particular. Loss of\\n      appetite, irregular sleep, excitability alternating with lassitude, etc.,\\n      are often overlooked, especially when the second stage-display of unusual\\n      mental and physical energy without subsequent fatigue- becomes apparent.\\n      This is often mistaken for a sign of unusually good health. When a young\\n      girl or mature woman, married or unmarried, feels that she can study ten\\n      hours a day and devote half of her night to pleasure or business; when\\n      besides much mental occupation she begins to rejoice in long walks without\\n      fatigue, that is the time when the mischief is going on without exciting\\n      timely suspicion. Relief is at last sought when the functional disorder of\\n      the nerves has gone to the opposite extreme, and becomes manifest in what\\n      is properly and popularly termed \"nervous prostration,\" when\\n      instead of having no sense of fatigue, the best bodily or mental effort\\n      seems intolerable, in grave cases rendering the patient a helpless being,\\n      completely dependent on the unremitting assistance of others whom she )it\\n      is usually a woman) rules with the inexorable power of the vis inertiae.\\n      \\n During this usually very protracted\\n      period of the disease convalescence usually sets in, but so imperceptibly\\n      that the physician alone can sometimes estimate its progress, which is\\n      unnoticeable to others towards whom the patient acts as she has for months\\n      or years. This is the time for action, too often delayed from motives of\\n      misplaced sympathy on the part of relatives and friends.\\n      \\n The affections is in many instances\\n      limited to the spine, the mind becoming only secondarily tired. In other\\n      cases it is spinal and cerebral; in others again chiefly cerebral. The\\n      line between this and insanity is always clearly definable. Though a\\n      neurasthenic patient may become insane, and probably the reverse, yet both\\n      are distinct conditions.\\n      \\n Books speak of this disease at common\\n      to men and women. Yet in this region in small towns as well as in large\\n      cities the cases of neurasthenia in women are preponderatingly great.\\n      \\n Hypochondriacs and hysteria stand in\\n      peculiar relation to neurasthenia. They maybe regarded as different\\n      species of the same genus; that is, more or less deeply seated\\n      disturbances of the cerebro-spinal system in which the sympathetic system\\n      is probably indirectly involved, as many functional disturbances presided\\n      over by the great sympathetic system often testify. Hypochondriasis, pure\\n      and simple as occurring in men, is easily distinguishable by its striking\\n      characteristic of introspection and despondency, occasioned by abnormal\\n      sensations, without marked physical weakness and tiredness. Pure\\n      hypochondriacs are often energetic, conscientious workers. In hysteria\\n      there is neither great tiredness nor tendency to introspection, but a\\n      paroxysmal or prolonged absence of the power of self control, in grave\\n      cases associated with tonic or clonic muscular spasm and loss of\\n      consciousness. While neurasthenia in its uncomplicated forms is free from\\n      these symptoms, but, as ample experience teaches, often complicated with\\n      both of the preceding forms to such an extent that it is often very\\n      difficult to tell which is primary and which secondary. The symptoms known\\n      as introspection, hysterical aberrations of the emotions, and neurasthenic\\n      sense of exhaustion are in their distinctive manifestations most important\\n      and constitute indications in the selection of remedial and dietetic\\n      measures.\\n      \\n The following are some observation of\\n      peculiarities observed in a large number of cases and peculiar to all:.\\n      \\n Introspection.-The neurasthenic patient\\n      in variably expresses her desire for relief, not so much in a direct\\n      appeal as in a supplicating, subdued tone of voice and manner. She rarely\\n      asks, \"What can you do to relieve me?\" but almost invariably,\\n      \"What is the cause of\" this or that sensation? If she is\\n      introspective, that is, hypochondriacal, she becomes a nosomaniac,\\n      watching acutely every one of her numerous distressing sensation, on the\\n      unremitting analysis of which her mind dwells. In marked cases she is\\n      quite unable to think of anything outside of herself, and in many cases\\n      dislikes to do so, preferring to river her attention on herself. Attempts\\n      to divert her annoy or anger her. Friends and relatives implore the\\n      physician to divert the patient, but all their attempts are in vain\\n      because quite misdirected.\\n      \\n Positive and Negative Will.-It seems\\n      sometimes as if the patient delights in her self-inspection, and that she\\n      prefers her condition to speedy recovery. This is not the case, for the\\n      patient will always assure the physician of her wish to get well. During\\n      the acute stage-a long yet definable period-this wish and longing cannot\\n      well be utilized, but the long and ill-defined period of convalescence\\n      must first be awaited. Here we shall always discover that the wish and the\\n      will of the patient are two very different mental conditions. The desire\\n      or wish for recovery is entirely unattended by any will effort to\\n      accomplish the desired end. The injunctions and directions of the\\n      physician are resisted by the same unconquerable power of negative power,\\n      or vis inertiae. The patient having been unable to exert her will, now\\n      thinks herself unable to use it.\\n      \\n Numerous Symptoms of Patients.-To\\n      physicians in search of indications for medicines each statement of\\n      patient concerning a sensation is apt to be considered as a symptom. Many\\n      years ago, when resolved to get at the keynote of a patient\\'s case, the\\n      writer determined to allow the patient to detail all her symptoms as long\\n      as she chose and to take accurate notes of each one till the right one\\n      should be disclosed; and this was to be done regardless of time and\\n      exertion. The patient, one who needed no urging to describe her\\n      \"symptoms,\" began in an almost inaudible voice, detailing one\\n      sensation after another with an unrivalled degree of clearness and\\n      vividness of expression; as she proceeded the voice became stronger, her\\n      face slightly flushed, and the most perfect descriptive language flowed in\\n      an endless stream. Each word was written down, page after page was filled;\\n      still she went on with unmistakable signs of satisfaction at being able to\\n      pour her pent-up emotions into willing and sympathetic ears. If, for a\\n      moment, the flow of language was interrupted, a simple question would\\n      re-animate her to proceed with renewed energy. Feelings seemed to beget\\n      feelings; their complexity gave the patient no trouble; her intellect was\\n      equal to the action of unraveling the most complicated sensation,\\n      separating them into their component parts and spreading them out before\\n      the mind of the listener. A glance at the watch showed that nearly two\\n      hours had passed, during which the feeblest of neurasthenic patients had\\n      talked incessantly. The note-book was full, the keynote was found. It was\\n      this: neurasthenic patients have innumerable sensation and exhibit no\\n      sings of fatigue after talking incessantly for nearly two hours.\\n      \\n Great Endurance of Neurasthenics.-The\\n      instance just related, which is one of many, illustrates two things. One\\n      is, that it is not the kind of sensation described but the fact that\\n      neurasthenics have innumerable sensations, that constitute the symptoms.\\n      The other thing is that many neurasthenics are capable of great exertion\\n      without suffering disagreeable after- effects from fatigue. This is\\n      illustrated by other cases of which I have notes. A highly neurasthenic\\n      young lady consented to camp out for her health near a lake. She was\\n      induced to join a party for a short walk along the lake. By trying what\\n      they thought a shorter road the party lost their way and took a very long\\n      walk of about four hours, through bogs and over forces. The neurasthenic\\n      was less fatigued than some of the others. The interesting observation was\\n      subsequently made that the patient had become interested in a young man of\\n      the party. She recovered her health within a year from that time. Other\\n      cases of this kind will appear under the head of therapeutic suggestions.\\n      \\n Neurasthenic Patients Crave\\n      Sympathy.-This is one of the most formidable obstacles to the curative\\n      management of such cases, for the kind of sympathy such patients crave is\\n      expressions of condolence and more or less deep affliction at so much\\n      suffering as the patient expresses. Such sympathy is most natural and does\\n      honor to the feelings of parents, sisters, brothers and husbands, but it\\n      is unfortunate that the deeper their expression of affliction so much the\\n      more profound will be the mental dejection and weakness of the patient.\\n      Almost every case which has come under the writer\\'s observation has been\\n      much hampered if not made hopeless by this condition of things, against\\n      which no remedy suggests itself that would not be construed as\\n      \"unkind\".\\n      \\n The origin of this very formidable and\\n      refractory nervous disease, like that of most diseases usually termed\\n      chronic, is either hereditary or acquired, as the histories of every\\n      observed case plainly testify. Either the father was a hypochondriac or\\n      the mother neurasthenic, or both parents were of unsound nervous\\n      constitution. Dipsomania on the part of parents produces neurasthenia in\\n      the children, as readily as it will be followed by any other form of\\n      nervous disease, according to the individual predisposition of the\\n      offspring. The excessive use of tea and coffee is another very active\\n      factor in the history of neurasthenics. Where fathers inclined to alcohol,\\n      mothers are addicted to tea and coffee, which, while its immediate effects\\n      do not obtrude themselves upon our notice, are none the less insidious in\\n      their more remote consequences.\\n      \\n The acquired forms of neurasthenia are\\n      of utmost interest to the therapeutist, and the sources of acquisition are\\n      readily stated. They are much brain-work with insufficient food and sleep.\\n      Such conditions obtain chiefly in women (less frequently in men) of fine\\n      intellectual ability, conscientiousness and ambition. Physical overwork\\n      with unintellectual women has no such effect. Quite analogous to the above\\n      are the conditions of care and sorrow, especially in women who are able\\n      for a long time to conceal and control their emotions. The usual\\n      consequence of such states of mind is disregard of food and insufficient\\n      sleep. Instances of acquired neurasthenia are presented in families of\\n      several girls and boys, where one or more of the former are Neurasthenic\\n      while the latter are vigorous and athletic. Boys delighting in vigorous\\n      exercise do not, as is the case with girls, lose appetite and sleep.\\n      \\n The effects of nervous exhaustion in\\n      boys are usually much less grave than in girls; as a rule such effects are\\n      manifested in mental, not muscular, tiredness, and they are relieved by\\n      air and exercise, while in girls and women those influences are shunned\\n      because they seem to increase the tiredness.\\n      \\n Predisposition-The temperament, or what\\n      in modern pharaseology is called the personal equation, plays a visible\\n      but uncontrollable part in the progress of neurasthenia, as temperament\\n      greatly determines the other imperfectly known condition known as\\n      predisposition. Where the disease is hereditary, it is easy to say that\\n      the predisposition is due to that source; where there is no history of\\n      heredity and where neurasthenia exists in the last members of a\\n      generation, it may be attributed to acquired predisposition which needed\\n      only the exciting cause to establish the disease in its most typical form.\\n      \\n One of the most common forms of\\n      neurasthenia, often quite intractable, results from a serious defect in\\n      our public school system, one which affects chiefly girls from twelve to\\n      fourteen years of age. The following is a brief example: The child rises\\n      late with no appetite for breakfast and no time to eat it if so inclined.\\n      The lessons, however, have been learned the evening before, and the school\\n      work is begun with an ambitions will and a crammed mind, and continues\\n      with one intermission of often not more than ten minutes or three of four\\n      hours. The pupil arrives at home ravenously hungry, eats too fast, and too\\n      much of injudiciously prepared food, too long in digesting to leave room\\n      for an appetite for even a light evening meal, or even for a breakfast the\\n      next morning.\\n      \\n In another case the girl or boy grows\\n      desperately hungry while at school, but being unprovided with food\\n      (lunch), goes on with the school exercises, at the end of which the sense\\n      of hunger has vanished and has been replaced by an aversion to normal\\n      food, with a possible craving for something pungent and indigestible. This\\n      observation can easily be made in many instances, and will, in as many\\n      cases, be seen to lead to nervous prostration, which is then treated by\\n      vile, patented concoctions consisting largely of whiskey, under the name\\n      of \"tonics,\" while the patient needs only the best that a\\n      legitimate market affords prepared in a sensible manner.\\n      \\n Typical Cases Ending in Rapid\\n      Recovery.-Curative results have already been indicated in what has been\\n      said above, and further indications for treatment may be gathered from a\\n      few cases of extremely rapid recovery of apparently incurable cases, to\\n      which brief allusion will here be made. A woman of forty had been a victim\\n      of grave neurasthenia for five years. In the absence of an inclination to\\n      exert himself, she had, during that period, been mostly confined to her\\n      bed or lounge, in the meantime giving birth to two children, going through\\n      gestation and confinement normally, without recovering from neurasthenic\\n      prostration which, in the course of some years more, rendered her entirely\\n      helpless. Her condition was associated with a feeling of dropping to\\n      pieces unless supported and braced by a harness of wood, iron and leather,\\n      in which she \"sat up\" for several hours each day, spending the\\n      rest of the time in bed. Having left the patient in this condition, it was\\n      reported before the writer\\'s next professional visit that Mrs.-had been\\n      cured, and that she was able to go out like other people. A visit to the\\n      house confirmed the report. The patient came to the door herself, and in a\\n      quiet manner, entirely without the least expression of joy or wonder at\\n      her release, stated, that having heard of a famous \"magnetic\\n      physician,\" she summoned him, was ordered by him to arise and stand;\\n      protesting that it was impossible, she was raised to her feet and again\\n      ordered to stand, then to walk. Fearing that she would fall, she begged\\n      the magnetic doctor to support her, which he peremptorily refused, saying\\n      she might fall if she liked. Instead of falling, she had to walk about the\\n      room, was then placed upon a lounge and subjected to a severe treatment of\\n      rolling and pummelling, and then ordered to dress and sit up until tired,\\n      to remain up and about like other people, and to call on the doctor in\\n      future, as he would not come so far to the patient again. This happened\\n      about twenty-five years ago, and the patient has been in very fair health\\n      arrested by insisting that all professional visits by the writer or any\\n      other physician to whose sympathy the patient could appeal must cease.\\n      This injunction was carried out conscientiously with the best results by\\n      the husband of the patient. Perhaps we may learn from this that sometimes,\\n      at least, the familiar motto is reversed, and angels rush in where fools\\n      fear to tread.\\n      \\n Profiting by this experience, another\\n      neurasthenic woman, unmarried, but of most intractable, antagonistic\\n      temperament, confined to her bed, in and out of hospitals, for years,\\n      wearing out the strength and means of her relatives and the patience of\\n      many physicians, was at length abandoned by them. It was a case of spinal\\n      and cerebral neurasthenia complicated with hypochondriasis in its most\\n      trying form of introspective maunderings and endless description of\\n      symptoms. She tormented her advisers by her endless tirades, the\\n      indulgence of which invariably aggravated her condition, and were there\\n      fore avoided, until once her physician yielded to the patient\\'s\\n      importunities for a visit, when be found her in her usual abject state of\\n      prostration. Guided by experience derived from cases like the one first\\n      described, he assisted the patient to her feet and marched her, will you\\n      nil you, up and down the room until he, at least, was thoroughly tired,\\n      and then departed with the promise never to do so again. The patient, on\\n      her part, made a number of her unnameable promises, but kept on her feet\\n      and let the doctors alone. Though not cured of deeply-rooted morbid mental\\n      faults, the neurasthenic phase of her condition had yielded to the change\\n      of the antagonistic element of her character from passive to very\\n      practical activity. A third very serious case of this kind occurred in the\\n      person of a girl of fifteen, of selfish character, who gradually became\\n      bed-ridden with spinal and cerebral neurasthenia, and tormented with the\\n      usual multifarious painful sensations, none of which, on the most\\n      pains-taking physical examination, resulted from demonstrable organic\\n      disease of genital or abdominal organs. The patient was most tenderly\\n      cared for by her mother, who, in the course of years, became so imbued\\n      with the idea of yielding to every wish and whim of the patient, that at\\n      length remonstrance became useless. The mother, though recognizing the\\n      importance of persuading or urging her daughter to depend more on herself,\\n      admitted that she had yielded so long that now she must continue to feed,\\n      dress and assist her charge in the most trivial things. Her food had to be\\n      placed in her mouth, the position of a hand or foot changed by some one\\n      else, although patient did so spontaneously when she chose. This went on\\n      for fifteen years, when the mother, growing old and feeble, died. Her\\n      maternal support being gone, the patient at once proved her ability to\\n      walk, to dress, to feed herself, and to seek light employment. Though far\\n      from well, she is equally far fro being a helpless, bed-ridden invalid.\\n      \\n A fourth case, still very vividly\\n      impressed on the writer\\'s mind, was one of a healthy, romping girl of 14,\\n      who, as happen in this remarkably capricious disease, in the midst of\\n      perfect health, one day took to her bed and remained there with all the\\n      symptoms of neurasthenia, involving first the spinal and finally the\\n      cerebral nerves. This patient was very amiable, conscientious, and\\n      sensible, never loquacious, and not troubled with hypochondriacal thoughts\\n      or sensations. Tiredness was the only expression she used in describing\\n      her feelings. There was literally no variation from this condition, which\\n      confined her to her bed for years, till she grew from a girl to a woman.\\n      Eating and sleeping well, and improving perceptibly in personal appearance\\n      and character, yet she lay on her couch tired and watched over with\\n      unremitting care by a most anxious mother, showing her solicitude and\\n      sympathy in every feature. Once, in the second year of the disease, a\\n      favorable interruption occurred. The mother, still a young woman, gave\\n      birth to another child. During her confinement the neurasthenic patient\\n      was in charge of her mother\\'s nurse, assisted by other servants. The\\n      nurse, while devoted to the daughter, agreed with the writer that excess\\n      of sympathy was injurious, and used her best and judicious endeavors\\n      gradually to persuade the patient to make some physical effort at walking\\n      and standing. In this she was so successful that in two weeks she\\n      accompanied the girl on half-mile walks up and down hill, finally without\\n      assistance. Thus, recovery seemed assured, and everything was favorable\\n      progressing towards it when the mother, having fully recovered, again took\\n      charge of her daughter, with the result that she at once took to her\\n      lounge and remained there two years longer. About that time other advice\\n      was urged and gladly acceded to, with the result that the case was\\n      diagnosed by an eminent surgeon as spinal paralysis in consequence of\\n      concussion, though it could never be shown when and where it occurred.\\n      Salves, plasters, anodynes, nervines, and electricity did no good, but\\n      effectually destroyed appetite and digestion, which higher to had been\\n      normal. So this adviser resigned in favor of a third, who, being a younger\\n      and less prejudiced man, agreed perfectly with the writer\\'s original\\n      opinion. He advised return to moderate exercise, avoidance of drugs, and\\n      less display of sympathy. This, though formerly rejected as\\n      \"unkind,\" was now acceded to as coming from a nerve- specialist,\\n      fresh from Europe, at that time very rare. Still attending the other\\n      members of the family, the writer had sample opportunity of observing the\\n      course of the case. Improvement was very slow and uncertain till financial\\n      misfortune overtook the family. Almost with a bound our patient left her\\n      cough, and, organizing a kindergarten, strove energetically in supporting\\n      herself and assisting her mother. The change came about in less than three\\n      weeks, and resulted in perfect recovery.\\n      \\n At this point another very instructive\\n      case of very speedy recovery, after six or seven years of neurasthenic\\n      prostration, deserves to be mentioned. A woman of 35 had been in bed and\\n      on the lounge most of the time for nearly seven years, at the end of which\\n      time she became my patient, her regular medical attendant having gone to\\n      Europe. She was of very amiable disposition and as sensitive as she was\\n      weak. Her symptoms, as in the other cases, were instantaneous exhaustion\\n      on the least physical exertion. She could give herself up to no mental\\n      occupation beyond directing her house-hold affairs, the education of her\\n      son, and the rehearsal of her numerous sensations. She had not been my\\n      patient long when her husband failed in business, so that the family was\\n      reduced from very comfortable circumstances to a condition which made it\\n      necessary for the patient to make her own living and that of the family.\\n      This she almost at once proceeded to do, setting aside all other\\n      considerations and establishing a boarding-house, where she did most of\\n      the work herself. This she has done now for ten or twelve years without a\\n      serious relapse. The time involved in the period of convalescence was\\n      scarcely more than three weeks, a although her work maybe said to have\\n      begun at the moment her resolution was taken.\\n      \\n Prognostics.-From these and other cases\\n      in and outside of the writer\\'s practice, it is safe to say that the\\n      majority of cases of neurasthenia recover, though years may elapse before\\n      that period. We learn, furthermore, that recoveries, especially of very\\n      inveterate cases, depend on conditions beyond the control of the\\n      physician, as was the case in the above-recorded instances, where\\n      circumstances forced the patient to cases to wish for recovery and to make\\n      an effort of the will. This having been once accomplished self-confidence,\\n      for a long time in abeyance, was permanently restored.\\n      \\n Curability, further, depends very much\\n      on the temperament of the patient, whether amiable, tractable and\\n      confiding in the honest endeavors of the physician, or whether refractory,\\n      suspicious, untruthful, selfish and antagonistic, of a disposition\\n      impossible to win over on account of unnatural distrust of every\\n      well-meaning person. The degree of intelligence of patients also has a\\n      pronounced influence on the result. The most readily curable cases are\\n      those acquired without hereditary predisposition, where the cause is found\\n      in the absence of food and sleep, also where sorrow and anxiety can be\\n      averted or counteracted by judicious conduct of near relatives and\\n      friends.\\n      \\n Dietetic Treatment.-This, as medicinal\\n      treatment, must be governed by the stage at which the case comes into the\\n      physician\\'s hands-whether yet in its prodromal, its acute or its chronic\\n      phase. The prodromal stage of the disease has no very decided\\n      pathognomonic signs. The most that can be recognized in this stage is that\\n      the patient\\'s habits or duties are of a kind which will eventually lead to\\n      obdurate neurasthenia if not arrested in time by removing the exciting\\n      causes. Too much pleasure, as well as too much care, especially in girls\\n      and woman, tends to neglect of food and rest, in the absence of which,\\n      excitements, whether of pleasure or care, begets a state of unrest in\\n      which repose is disagreeable. With such a condition comes a list of\\n      incipient casual complaints of headache, imperfect sleep, notional ways of\\n      eating, working or playing. A few questions will determine whether the\\n      patient is living according to normal or abnormal habits with regard to\\n      appetite, sleep and occupation. Where these are found, their alteration to\\n      normal ways must be instead on. It is unnecessary to say that this is\\n      easier said than done, for it will probably meet with serious objections\\n      on the part of the patient, if not on that of her relatives; for most\\n      likely she has examinations for college to prepare for, involving several\\n      months of dose and careful study at night, and the patient cannot waste\\n      time in sleeping and eating while cramming that little excited and\\n      ambitions brain. A failure in the examinations would be as much of a\\n      disappointment to parents as to patient, who proves, as usual, that this\\n      appellation is a misnomer. She accordingly goes in as she please, lied by\\n      an increasing morbidly ambitions impulse, and the result is likely to be\\n      the mournful satisfaction on the part of the physician of being obliged to\\n      say, \"I told you before what would happen.\" Of course, all\\n      regret the now evident nerve-prostration, while, if the doctor had\\n      succeeded in enforcing his rules, he would in many cases experience the\\n      still more painful reproach of having been too severe. Nevertheless,\\n      absolute firmness and a kindly but unflinching exertion of his will,\\n      without the least compromise, reward the physician with the best results\\n      in such cases.\\n      \\n When the case, after the stage of\\n      excitement and untiring restlessness (at which it would still be speedily\\n      curable by simple dietetic rules) has, after weeks or months, entered upon\\n      the phase of painful prostration, here we encounter backache, oppressive\\n      headache, and absolute loss of mental or bodily endurance, measures of\\n      dietetic management are much less effective and much more difficult to\\n      find. it is at this stage that slight rise of temperature will occur,\\n      especially towards evening; then the backache and headache disappear, the\\n      pallor is replaced by a flush of color, the eyes lose their listless look,\\n      and the patient is inclined to enter upon some diversion or excitement,\\n      followed by a restless night and a morning of exhaustion and a renewal of\\n      all painful sensations. Most of such patients feel much better in the\\n      evening when they are ready for some entertainment, while in a normal\\n      state this would be the time for relaxation and repose.\\n      \\n The dietetic treatment of this stage is\\n      methodical rest. In severe cases the patient will do well to remain in bed\\n      for several days or even for weeks. It is well to shorten this period as\\n      much as possible and to insist on walking about, or, at least. sitting for\\n      a specified time every day. This may be varied b equally specified periods\\n      of rest in the recumbent position.\\n      \\n Irregularities of eating are at this\\n      and at all times to be superseded by the most rigid regularity of meals.\\n      The traditional and conventional three-meal system, however well adapted\\n      to the needs of a vigorous man or woman, does not agree with the\\n      neurasthenic patient. It is much better that these should eat oftener;\\n      four times a day is best in most cases, for the simple reason that in this\\n      way a patient, while eating less at a time, consumes more food in the\\n      aggregate.\\n      \\n As neurasthenic patients are rarely\\n      troubled with absolute aversion to wholesome food, they are generally able\\n      to consume a liberal quantity, about which it is only needful to remark\\n      here that the food should be selected from among the articles and dishes\\n      which the patient likes, provided they belong to the order of good, normal\\n      articles of food, to the exclusion of those which simply please the taste\\n      without being digestible. A dish entirely of meat or \"animal\\n      food\" is as far from being a good diet for neurasthenics as one\\n      consisting entirely of \"vegetable\" food. As a rule, the diet\\n      list should comprise one-third of nitrogenous material and two-thirds of\\n      carbohydrates. Together with these, it is a great mistake to neglect the\\n      fats, such as good butter and the fats of meats. And, lastly, every\\n      patient of this kind should be made to drink some water often, a dietetic\\n      feature too often neglected.\\n      \\n During this stage, actually fatiguing\\n      exercise of body and mind should be avoided, while, on the other hand, the\\n      patient\\'s mind should be directed away from herself, in which she is much\\n      assisted by withholding a certain kind of emotional sympathy, quite as\\n      natural as it is difficult to repress on the part of affectionate persons.\\n      Of this, a few words further on.\\n      \\n There is no definite time for the\\n      duration of this stage, which, however, depends largely on the time during\\n      which the exciting causes have acted, either aided by or without a\\n      predisposition. It is certain, however, that the sooner it is recognized\\n      and the exciting causes eliminated, so much the sooner recovery will\\n      begin. But there is a stage at which the best of experience and judgment\\n      often fail, especially in very inveterate cases. If the case is one of a\\n      patient whom the physician has had opportunity of watching at least since\\n      the earlier stages, the difficulty is not so great as it is in old cases\\n      months or even of several years\\' duration which come to treatment late. In\\n      these, the line between the intermediate stage and incipient convalescence\\n      cannot be drawn. The patient is as neurasthenic and hypochondriacal as\\n      ever; cannot bear the slightest mental or bodily exertion, not even a word\\n      or a look, without sings of apparent exhaustion, while nearly the whole\\n      time is spent in bed under anxious care of sympathetic attendants. In such\\n      cases, having become assured, by careful physical examination, of the\\n      absence of organic disease, seeing the patient generally well nourished\\n      and in fair muscular condition, the physician is warranted in assuming\\n      that the disease has run its course, that whatever morbid (pathological)\\n      process there may have been progressing in the nervous system, this\\n      process has now come to and end, but it has left the patient\\'s mental\\n      condition habituated to the moods of the past months or years, and fixed,\\n      as it were, indelibly in the memory. It is the habit that now remains, not\\n      the disease.\\n      \\n If reasonably sure of this, and calling\\n      to mind the rapid recoveries and the circumstances attending them, as\\n      above detailed, the physician is now safe in ordering a more energetic\\n      treatment, calculated to rouse the self-reliance of the patient. All\\n      visible signs of sympathy must now be set aside; the actins and demeanor\\n      of the attendants should, from this time, if not before, be changed so as\\n      to give the patient the impression that she is no longer an invalid, but\\n      expected to rely on her own exertion. Instead of being fed, the food\\n      should be placed where she must go for and eat it. She should now be\\n      expected to dress and attend, without assistance, to her natural wants.\\n      This, with some temperaments, is almost impossible, with al extremely\\n      difficult. The best course to pursue is to remove such patients from\\n      sympathetic relatives or friends, and to place them in charge of kind,\\n      reliable, but eminently practical nurses.\\n      \\n The first effect of this is either to\\n      throw the patient into a stage of helpless despondency, which, again\\n      appealing powerfully to the sympathies of those nearest to her, often\\n      frustrates the physician\\'s plans which, if firmly but kindly adhered to,\\n      would, ere long, prove of their superiority by signs of returning\\n      self-reliance and absence of complaints on the part of the patient. A\\n      second form of effect is that occurring in patients of obstreperous,\\n      selfish disposition, whose opposition and even anger is aroused by being\\n      thrown on their own resources after the removal of depressing and\\n      unpractical sympathy. This opposition or temper, often manifested in all\\n      sorts of intrigues and subterfuges on the part of the patient, if not\\n      supinely yielded to by sympathetic persons, will finally be replaced by a\\n      more rational disposition. On the whole, anger or active opposition are\\n      signs of returning energy, which, once coming to the consciousness of the\\n      patient, takes the form of self- reliance. it is this way that the cures\\n      of chronic cases above related can be explained, and physicians should\\n      profit by such experience for the benefit of their patients.\\n      \\n The general dietetic management now\\n      readily follows from what has been said, and needs only a few general\\n      modifications. The first duty of the physician will be to test the degree\\n      of reliance to be placed on the patient and her friends, ad to win them\\n      over if possible to his plans, and his success will be in proportion to\\n      the degree of confidence he is able to inspire. This personal confidence\\n      should not degenerate into a mere personal liking or attachment of a\\n      sympathy-craving neurasthenic who should discover henceforth that all\\n      sentimental expressing of sympathy are about to take a practical form,\\n      aiming at a definite result-the patient\\'s health-which she wishes but\\n      cannot exert her will to attain. The best and often the only way to do\\n      away with sentiment and to reach practical kindness is to remove the\\n      patient from certain home influence, and to place her in a hospital or\\n      elsewhere under the management of competent nurses who, without being\\n      selfish, know how to exert a certain amount of wholesome push as fast as\\n      the patient can bear it. Without the removal of sentimental sympathy, all\\n      efforts at counteracting the purely hypochondriacal side of neurasthenia\\n      are useless.\\n      \\n In these cases of neurasthenia as yet\\n      uncomplicated with the hypochondriacal element of introspective nosomania,\\n      there is only one unconditional rule to be followed, especially in\\n      acquired cases whose evident cause was incessant, conscientious work of\\n      mind and body, together with insufficient food and sleep. Such cases come\\n      on very insidiously, the loss of strength-that is, the actual waste of\\n      nerve-substance-being just a trifle grater than the quantity restored, the\\n      patient unconsciously using up a minute part of her capital every day.\\n      Here the rule should be to reverse matters to insuring a supply of\\n      nourishment and time for its assimilation greater than was the case\\n      heretofore. The case of young school-girls belong in this class. The time\\n      of food and rest should be carefully controlled at home, the duty of the\\n      physician being to educate indifferent and ignorant parents up to an\\n      appreciation of the nature of the case. It is generally not difficult to\\n      open their eyes through the medium of their anxiety concerning their\\n      children\\'s health. Having thus insured sufficient rest and food at home,\\n      the physician\\'s next object of attention should be the regulations of the\\n      school. Here is the point where teachers have an opportunity of exerting\\n      their most practical influence. It should be made obligatory on the part\\n      of teachers to institute inquiry as to whether pupils have had their meals\\n      before coming to school. This they could often ascertain without a\\n      question, by reading the pupil\\'s condition in her emaciated form, pale\\n      face and nervous manner. To guard against neglect at home, it would be an\\n      easy matter to insist that all pupils of public and private schools should\\n      bring with them some proper food. The few who do so generally bring\\n      sweets-an apple, orange or a few dry crackers-when a piece of good bread\\n      and slice of cold meat would be what they actually need. All pupils should\\n      pass inspection, and if remiss in this important particular, the\\n      delinquent should be dismissed with several marks against her. To expect\\n      this of teachers would be a great advance in the place of futile\\n      innovations of endeavoring to send forth from our common schools graduates\\n      in arts and sciences.\\n      \\n Sudden Effects.-A large number of cases\\n      of neurasthenia, especially those complicated with inveterate\\n      Hypochondriasis, are frequently traced to some sudden occurrence, having\\n      the effect of a mental or physical shock. In one patient, a vigorous girl,\\n      used to romping, climbing and running lie a boy, the cause was supposed to\\n      be a slight thump she received during a game of blindman\\'s-buff. She\\n      thought nothing of it at the time, but it was suggested long after the\\n      patient\\'s illness began. In another case some mental shock of joy or\\n      grief, not very severe and such as is often experienced in every person\\'s\\n      life, is the beginning of months of nervous prostration.\\n      \\n There is quite an array of evidence\\n      that neurasthenia which has entered upon a hypochondriacal stage or\\n      complication with or without a strong hysterical admixture, is curable by\\n      sudden impressions in the form of a shock, or more gradually by frequent\\n      repetitions of an impression. Such cases, as I have shown above, occur\\n      most commonly in the stage when what may be considered the essential\\n      pathological disturbances of function have run their course and have left\\n      the patient in a state of mental disturbance which indicated that the\\n      patient\\'s recovery depends entirely upon her volition. But there is none,\\n      and so far nothing has succeeded in arousing it. Persuasion is as useless\\n      and irritating, as argument would be in a case of insanity with a fixed\\n      illusion. The resemblance between this and the state of mind of a\\n      hypochondriacal neurasthenic is very close. She cannot move nor thick.\\n      Exhaustion overcomes her and keeps her its victim for years, when suddenly\\n      the scene changes, and a few days or weeks suffice to restore the patient\\n      to activity. In one instance it is attributed to medical, in another to\\n      \"mind cure,\" in a third to \"Christian science;\" in\\n      still other cases massage has done it, in others again \"magnetic\\n      influence,\" in others the very powerful factor necessity. It is\\n      certain that cases of this kind, produced by sudden effects on the mind of\\n      a predisposed person, are also cured by such effects. Whatever the visible\\n      form of these effects may be -whether that of \"Christian\\n      science,\" joy, grief or absolute inexorable necessity, there is\\n      always to be noticed a certain force and condition involving the modern\\n      idea of suggestion, which comes to the patient in an irresistible degree\\n      and now sets the function of the will in motion again.\\n      \\n Experience teaches that it is by no\\n      means a matter of indifference which of these forms of effect are brought\\n      into action. In one case it is the professional Christian scientist\\'s\\n      method, in another the almost brutal exertion of a person\\'s will combined\\n      with some physical force. In either case the patient is aroused from his\\n      inertia, and discovers his powers of mental and bodily ability to act.\\n      \\n A deplorable result is that recoveries\\n      after such effects are attributed in the popular mind to supernatural\\n      causes. That such is not the case may be gathered form instances occurring\\n      in very sensible and intelligent patients, whose reason is scarcely ever\\n      so far disturbed and weakened that they do not resent the proposition of\\n      trying, e.g., Christian science or mind cure.\\n      \\n Nevertheless, it is the mind cure which\\n      the intelligent patient needs quite as much as the ignorant and\\n      superstitious person; the difference is only the form in which the\\n      influencing force is applied. While in one case it is obedience to the\\n      candidly expressed instructions of the physician, in the other case the\\n      result is the to mystification. In either case it is the powerful stimulus\\n      of hope and aroused confidence that recovery will be realized.\\n      \\n The definition of suggestion does not\\n      fully cover the meaning, because the influence employed is greater than\\n      mere suggestion. The physician\\'s plan of action should be straightforward\\n      assurance of recovery, a direct appeal to hope, and an unceasing endeavor\\n      to arouse the self-reliance of the patient, not so much by verbal\\n      exhortations as by a manner and department from which the patient learns\\n      more readily than from words what is expected. If the attitude of the\\n      physician is appreciated, and seconded by the relatives and attendants, a\\n      favorable result is much more certain to follow.\\n      \\n Hypnotism is not advisable. There are\\n      now existing ancient neurasthenic invalids dating from the times of\\n      spiritualism when they were famous \"mediums.\" Hypnotism weakness\\n      the will and nervous endurance, and produces a predisposition to emotional\\n      nervousness with an intractable erotic admixture. The suggestions sought\\n      to be instilled into a hypnotized patient amount to nothing. The mental\\n      influence of mystical treatment administered while the patients is awake\\n      is much more powerful in awaking hope and confidence than the uncertain\\n      effects of an abnormal state like that of hypnotism. Mystification, again,\\n      though sometimes unavoidable with the best intention, is less powerful\\n      than direct and intelligible encouragement. While resort to mystification\\n      should be shunned by reputable physicians, the question arises as to what\\n      shall be done with the many who, from lack of intelligence or education,\\n      are entirely beyond the reach of honest common sense, and who will persist\\n      in mystifying themselves, who remain neurasthenic invalids in spite of the\\n      best regulations of the physician, and who do not recover unless their\\n      encouragement follows some mystical formalities which alone arouse their\\n      \"faith\" and finally their confidence and will-power. For the\\n      present there is no way out of the dilemma but to submit such patients to\\n      the suggestive methods of what is popularly known as mind cure and\\n      Christian science. In doing so, physicians should use their influence as\\n      far as possible in selecting the most honest persons of this class.\\n      \\n DISCUSSION.\\n      \\n JAMES C. WOOD, M.D.: I have nothing but\\n      words of praise for Dr. Wesselhoeft\\'s excellent paper. It is very evident\\n      that the author\\'s inspiration came not from books but from actual contact\\n      with neurasthenic subjects, for the impress of originality is most\\n      conspicuous. It is a production which could only come from one of\\n      experience and from a reasoner. I consider it a most valuable contribution\\n      to the literature of that now most interesting subject,\\n      \"neurasthenia\".\\n      \\n The doctor, in his paper, has sometimes\\n      used the term \"neurasthenia\" instead of\\n      \"neurasthenia.\" The first of these means, according to Thomas,\\n      great nervous power or excitement; the second, nervous debility. I taken\\n      it from the context that the subject dealt with is neurasthenia. To the\\n      average mind there exists what seems to me a needless confusion regarding\\n      the terms, nervous prostration, hysteria and hystero-neurosis. As I\\n      understand these terms they define distinct conditions, though there is a\\n      frequent blending the one with the other. The term nervous prostration,\\n      which is a synonym of neurasthenia, defines itself; the term hysteria\\n      should be restricted to those general neuroses characterized particularly\\n      by psychical manifestations, though not infrequently by motor, sensory,\\n      secretory, vasomotor and reflex derangements as well; while the term\\n      hysteroneurosis implies the uterine origin of symptoms manifesting\\n      themselves in organs remote from the uterus without structural changes in\\n      such organs, being the direct result of reflex nervous influence starting\\n      from the uterus. The last term does not occur in the paper under\\n      discussion. From the standpoint of a gynecologist I think that this is\\n      misleading.\\n      \\n Let us see why and how it is that these\\n      three conditions (I will not call them diseases) are so frequently\\n      associated. I think that all will admit the frequent occurrence in woman\\n      of reflex symptoms, the result of pelvic lesions. An irritation staring\\n      form the pelvis is conveyed to the genito-spinal centre, thence to any or\\n      all organs with which this centre communicates. The organ oftener involved\\n      than any other is the stomach. This is shown by the frequent occurrence of\\n      nausea and vomiting following conception. The nervous system may have been\\n      previously involved, but oftener it becomes so only after the nutrition is\\n      depraved, which, sooner or later, occurs if the pelvic lesion is not\\n      removed. The depraved blood fails to supply the nerve centres with that\\n      which they need to sustain them, and they become anaemic. Prostration is\\n      but a subjective manifestation of the anaemia, and it varies in degree\\n      from a slight indisposition to the most abject helplessness.\\n      \\n If, then, nervous prostration may have\\n      its beginning in a pelvic lesion, is it possible for a pelvic lesion to be\\n      inaugurated by systemic disturbances? Personally, I believe that it is,\\n      and offer this explanation as the modus operandi by which such a lesion is\\n      induced: Marked circulatory changes nearly always attend nervous\\n      prostration. The circulation is presided over by the vaso-motor system,\\n      and wear and repair depend upon the proper regulation of this system. If\\n      it becomes disturbed, the bloodvessels dilate or contract unduly, with\\n      resulting local hyperaemia or local anaemia, as the case maybe. The\\n      climacteric flushes are the result of such disturbance. The alternate\\n      coldness and heat of the extremities, so often associated with rectal and\\n      uterine lesions, is another familiar illustration. If the brain is\\n      involved, either insomnia or drowsiness occur, depending upon whether the\\n      brain is anaemic or hyperaemic. Flatulence, gastralgia, and nervous\\n      dyspepsia result when the stomach is similarly affected. The womb and the\\n      ovaries, because of the periodical congestion imposed upon them, are\\n      oftener implicated by these unnatural circulatory disturbances than any of\\n      the pelvic organs, and in time also become unduly hyperaemic or anaemic,\\n      as the case may be.\\n      \\n It will thus be seen that nervous\\n      prostration may exist independently of pelvic lesions, or, conversely,\\n      pelvic lesions may exist independently of nervous prostration.\\n      Nevertheless, the two are frequently associated, and this fact ought, I\\n      believe, to be kept in mind in dealing with the affection known as\\n      neurasthenia. Hysterical manifestations nearly always come to the surface\\n      in nervous prostration, and they also frequently attend pelvic lesions.\\n      Indeed, the term \"hystero-psychosis\" has been coined for the\\n      purpose of defining certain psychical disturbances of presumably pelvic\\n      origin, and in the broadest sense neurasthenia is not uncommonly an\\n      hysteroneurosis. It is the frequent association of these three conditions\\n      which, it seems to me, makes it more practicable to study them conjointly.\\n      \\n The special symptoms of nervous\\n      prostration are most variable. Introspection, as Dr. Wesselhoeft has\\n      pointed out, makes of the patient a nosomaniac. The anaemic nerve centres\\n      are unduly impressionable, and a mental shock which would not seriously\\n      affect a stronger and more rugged woman falls with crushing force upon one\\n      whose nutrition is already depraved. In this way are developed disorders\\n      of sensibility, alternations of mobility, circulatory disturbances,\\n      anomalies of secretion and exertion, disorders of the gastro-intestinal\\n      canal, dermatoses, and general and psychical disturbances of all kinds.\\n      Many of these affections start from pelvic lesions, and are nearly always\\n      associated with depravity of nutrition and more or less nervous\\n      prostration.\\n      \\n Some of the worst symptoms of\\n      neurasthenia with which I have had to contend have been hyperaesthesia of\\n      the articulations, giving rise to the so-called \"hysterical\\n      joint.\" Here the prostration is usually not profound, and it is\\n      possible to apply the somewhat energetic treatment recommended by Dr.\\n      Wesselhoeft. I remember one case very distinctly, the detailed history of\\n      which I shall give in another place, which brought me much reputation\\n      because of the \"remarkable\" cure I was fortunate enough to make.\\n      \\n The patient, a beautiful girl of\\n      eighteen, had been bed- ridden for three years with supposed hip-joint\\n      disease. She was in college before assuming the ride of an invalid, and\\n      worried much over her studies and work. She sustained a fall a short time\\n      previously to taking to her bed, and to this fall the injury to the hip\\n      was attributed. She had been from physician to physician and from\\n      sanitarium to sanitarium without receiving benefit. All of the numerous\\n      medical men under whose care she had been, directed their attention to the\\n      hip and applied the classical treatment for morbus coxarius without avail.\\n      The patient had finally reached a point where introspection was her chief\\n      occupation and her mind dwelt almost continually upon a \"diseased\\n      hip.\" She was finally brought to me, coming in an invalid\\'s chair and\\n      looking the very picture of dependency. There was a slight degree of\\n      anaemia, though this was not marked. Notwithstanding the expression\\n      expression of abjectness the girl did not look seriously ill. The hip was\\n      excessively tender upon pressure, but there was no local increase of\\n      temperature, no evidences of fever and suppuration, and forcible\\n      apposition by striking the heel was not very painful. More less spastic\\n      contraction of the flexor muscles of the affected side existed, which gave\\n      to the limb an appearance of actual shortening, which was very deceptive.\\n      Hysterical symptoms were common. On examination I found the left ovary\\n      exquisitely tender. Compression of the ovary increased the pain in the hip\\n      most decidedly and gave rise to much nervous agitation. I did not,\\n      therefore, deem it wise to recommend local treatment other than the daily\\n      use of the hot douche. She had long been a victim of ovarian\\n      dysmenorrhoea. I placed upon the ankle of the affected limb three pounds\\n      of bar-lead, prescribed a pair of crutches and insisted upon her walking.\\n      The lead was used to overcome the spastic contraction as well as for its\\n      moral effect. I did not deem the joint lesion of such a character as to\\n      used extension. In two months\\' time this patient discarded her crutches\\n      for a cane. Six weeks later she put up the cane and is now perfectly well.\\n      \\n This was a case in which somewhat harsh\\n      measures were eminently appropriate.\\n      \\n In marked contrast to the case just\\n      recorded is the following: Mrs.-, aet. 47, widow for twenty years. She is\\n      a devoted church-woman, and for years was a leader in all charitable work\\n      done in the community in which she resided. Through friends she was urged\\n      to consult me, and I think that the call to the neighboring town in which\\n      she lived was countermanded at least four or five times before the finally\\n      mustered up courage and strength enough to see me. Upon reaching the\\n      bedside I found my patient in a room made dark by closed blinds, over\\n      which were hung heavy blankets to shut out every ray of light. The mirror\\n      was turned toward the wall for fear a ray of light might strike it and\\n      flesh throughout the darkened room. Nor did the patient rest under these\\n      extreme precautions, for the eyes were protected with two pairs of colored\\n      glasses with side attachments. Hyperaesthesia of the sense of hearing was\\n      equally marked and the noise was excluded from the room by double doors\\n      whose keyholes were stuffed with cotton. She l so had her ears filled with\\n      cotton, over which she wore ear-mufflers. She was emaciated to an extreme\\n      degree, and had been reduced to her miserable condition by a series of\\n      events which frequently precede profound neurasthenia. Her husband was\\n      killed during the war, and she was left childless. Twelve months previous\\n      to taking to her bed she nursed her mother through a long and fatal\\n      illness. This greatly prostrated her, yet she kept up until a favorite\\n      brother-in-law was thrown from a carriage and killed. This was the last\\n      straw, and the shock compelled her to take to her bed. In due time loss of\\n      appetite with irritability of the stomach developed, which, of course, led\\n      to marked depravity of nutrition. With the anaemia came hyperaesthesia of\\n      the special senses, spinal irritation, headache, hysterical\\n      manifestations, etc. There was no series pelvic lesion, although she had\\n      been much treated for an alleged uterine displacement with congestion.\\n      Unfortunately, she was encouraged, instead of discouraged, in her\\n      invalidism, and she soon became a nosomaniac of the worst type. She had\\n      written down her symptoms one at a time, and the record is such a typical\\n      one that I should like to give it in full, but time forbids.\\n      \\n With great difficulty the patient was\\n      moved on a cough to a private hospital and placed under the Weir Mitchell\\n      treatment. I ignored the pelvic trouble entirely. It is unnecessary to\\n      give in detail the progress of the case from day to day after this\\n      treatment was inaugurated. Suffice it to say that the improvement was of\\n      the most marked character, and in six weeks from the time she entered the\\n      hospital she walked to her carriage with her eyes and ears unprotected.\\n      She soon resumed her church and charitable work, in which she again takes\\n      much delight.\\n      \\n This woman wanted to get well. She was\\n      a woman of pure motives and high ideals. She had, in the language of Dr.\\n      Wesselhoeft, the wish, but, unaided, not the will. She required the aid of\\n      an intelligent, strong-minded, nurse who could bring to her exercise\\n      applied in such a way as to enable her to assimilate food without the\\n      expenditure of nerve force. She co- operated with her physician and nurse\\n      in every possible way, and as soon as the anaemic nerve cells became\\n      flushed with new blood she began to improve. To have commanded this\\n      patient \"to take up her bed and walk\" before improving her\\n      nutrition would have been as unscientific as to have placed the first\\n      patient in bed with extension and counter-extension applied to the limb. I\\n      know of no class of cases requiring for their successful treatment more\\n      tact and discrimination than that under consideration.\\n      \\n I feel confident that I have many times\\n      cut the affection short in its prodromal stage by removing the girl from\\n      college work and insisting upon open-air exercise. Static electricity has,\\n      in my hands, proved exceedingly useful both during the prodromal stage and\\n      that of convalescence.\\n      \\n I will conclude by saying that I have\\n      been impressed with the frequency with which an hereditary history of\\n      epilepsy has been met with in the cases of neurasthenia passing under my\\n      observation.'\n",
      " 'Tresorie - SOME OF THE DISEASES PREVENTING AND COMPLICATION PREGNANCY\\n[Diseases Preventing & Complicating Pregnancy]\\n\\n STERILITY.-DeSinety, Treub, Furbinger,\\n      et al., attribute 50 per cent. of unproductive marriages to the husbands,\\n      saying that sterility in the male is more often the cause of barren\\n      marriages than is generally supposed.\\n      \\n This cause of sterility I pass by, as\\n      also sterility due to mechanical obstruction, incomplete ovulation and the\\n      numerous other causes of this condition, too manifold for mere\\n      enumeration, to consider obesity as a causative agent in this condition. I\\n      need not say that the advocates for surgical interference for the relief\\n      of this condition are legion. Sims makes the assertion that sterility can\\n      be cured by surgical means only. That, of course, is Allopathic arguing\\n      pure and simple. Cases requiring surgical interference do arise, but any\\n      treatment which raises the nutrition of the entire organism, improves the\\n      blood-formation, and favors the resorption of pathological products in the\\n      sexual organs, is to be regarded as the indicated remedy.\\n      \\n Published statements are my authority\\n      for saying that excellent results have followed the administration of\\n      drugs, nevertheless; and in complete defiance of all therapeutic measures,\\n      a certain percentage of women remain barren; for with the more occult\\n      causes of sterility we remain, as yet, unacquainted, consequently they\\n      cannot all be reached with say kind of treatment whatever.\\n      \\n The following case I report somewhat in\\n      detail. Whilst not an exceptional case at all, it bears directly upon the\\n      subject under consideration, and possesses, it seems to me, some decidedly\\n      interesting features. My object in selecting this particular one is to\\n      call attention, if possible, to a condition not sufficiently considered.\\n      Mrs. J., aet. 26, married about two years and a half, appealed to my\\n      knowledge for a reason as to why she remained childless. The lady was\\n      carrying an excess of flesh, being under the medium height, and weighing\\n      186 pounds, but appeared to be in good health; family and previous history\\n      all that could be desired. Examination showed none of the common causes of\\n      sterility; neither, so far as I could ascertain, was the husband\\n      responsible for this unproductive condition of affairs. Some previous\\n      experiences of my own, with the added testimony of other and able men, was\\n      my reason for charging this condition of things to the excess of flesh,\\n      this, by the husband, being laughingly charged to excess of laziness.\\n      \\n We all, undoubtedly, are familiar with\\n      that peculiar disease of the blood-corpuscles which, whilst producing\\n      flesh, relaxes at the same time the muscular force; acting also, I\\n      believe, upon the muscular fibres of the uterus and upon the ovaries,\\n      inducing not only serious menstrual disorders but sterility. McKee,\\n      Philbert, and others give several instances of sterility chargeable to\\n      obesity, the women in question having been married several years without\\n      bearing children, and all became mothers after losing a portion of their\\n      flesh. If any other argument were needed in support of this theory we\\n      might turn to the quadrupeds, where we find the poorest breeders among the\\n      fleshiest animals. Fournel has a very able treatise on \"The Effects\\n      of Obesity on the Menstrual Functions and Parturition.\" Without\\n      having had any actual case of this description to deal with, he inclines\\n      very strongly towards the belief that obesity favors sterility. In the\\n      treatment of the case before mentioned, the patient was subjected to a\\n      daily massage of the entire body, with a special pelvic massage three\\n      times a week. This, in the main, consists in elevating the uterus as high\\n      as possible with the finger in the vagina, ending with a quick and decided\\n      vibratory motion. The diet received particular attention, as at this time\\n      there was a slight gastric ailment. The indicated remedy, Thuja, was given\\n      in the minimum dose. At the end of three months almost thirty pounds of\\n      flesh was gone, a considerable reduction. As an experiment, I recommended\\n      coitus in the knee-elbow position, advising that the lady remain quiet as\\n      long as possible after coition, with thighs well flexed. She became\\n      enciente, but miscarried at eight weeks. There was, comparatively\\n      speaking, but little pain and not much subsequent haemorrhage. She made a\\n      rapid recovery. Since then a living child has been born to them.\\n      \\n I believe I am safe in saying that this\\n      result would hardly have obtained were it not for the prophylactic\\n      measures adopted.\\n      \\n At the end of the first two months the\\n      patient was attacked with haemorrhage. A similar occurrence took place at\\n      irregular intervals during the following five months, the quantity of\\n      blood lost being much greater than that at the normal menstrual period.\\n      \\n For the greater part of the last five\\n      months she kept her bed, at the end of which time the tendency of the\\n      uterus to empty itself could be resisted no longer. A seven months\\' child\\n      was born, and is to-day doing well.\\n      \\n Pseudocyesis cerebral pregnancy,\\n      phantom pregnancy (whatever name we may call it by) is a disease which\\n      must come under the head of those \"complicating pregnancy.\" Mrs.\\n      M., a lady, married two or three years, aet. 29.

When I first saw the lady in question she\\n      was a perfect picture of health, and, according to appearance and her own\\n      statements, about seven months pregnant. I made no examination. This\\n      appeared to be a thoroughly intelligent woman, and, according to her own\\n      statement, there was cessation of the menses. There certainly was an\\n      enlargement of the abdomen and breasts, a milky secretion, and the lady\\n      was sure that she felt foetal movement. On February 28th of the present\\n      year I was called to attend her in labor. Examination showed that no\\n      pregnancy existed. So far as I could ascertain there was no assignable\\n      origin for this condition other than nervous influences, the phenomena\\n      being purely muscular distension of the abdomen.\\n      \\n Mayham reports a case of a woman 73\\n      years old, claiming to be pregnant; he also claims that subsequently she\\n      was delivered of a child; this is an Allopathic report, however, of which\\n      we will take a Homoeopathic dose. Haultain reports three cases of cerebral\\n      pregnancy. In the first, he says no cause whatever was to be found; in the\\n      second, there was a small fibroid growth in the anterior uterine wall.\\n      Hauck reports a case where the vomiting, peristalsis, and flatus, caused\\n      by alcoholism were supposed to be caused by the pregnant state. Such cases\\n      are uncommon, but they emphasize the importance of making a thorough\\n      examination, in all cases where positive information is desired of the\\n      existence or non-existence of pregnancy.\\n      \\n Hyperemesis Gravidarum.-An animated\\n      discussion, held recently between two celebrated Allopaths of Stuttgart\\n      and Leipsic, has served to awaken a renewed interest in this subject,\\n      without in the least adding anything new to our stock of knowledge\\n      regarding its aetiology. Notwithstanding the frequency of the vomiting of\\n      pregnancy, its very distressing character in many instances, and its\\n      imminent, its very distressing character in many instances, and its\\n      imminent danger, we find but very few contributions of any value, to\\n      either the aetiology of the disorder or its therapeutics. I do not expect\\n      to add anything specially new myself, but it does seem to me that our\\n      knowledge of the vomiting of pregnancy, is to say the least, in a most\\n      contradictory state. Some physicians look upon it as a trifling matter,\\n      others as a thing to be endured, and some-these are in the right too-view\\n      even the mildest cases with gravity. Even in the mildest cases of morning\\n      sickness there is a constant drain upon the nervous system, putting the\\n      sufferer into a condition, in which she is very much less able to endure\\n      parturition than she would otherwise have been.\\n      \\n Dr. Harrison Mettler says: \"After\\n      careful inquiry I find that women who suffer from much morning sickness\\n      have as a rule, tedious or otherwise troublesome labors. I have observed\\n      in multiparae that at one time they will have much nausea and vomiting\\n      followed by a difficult labor, while at another time they will be quite\\n      free from the vomiting, and will pass through the succeeding labor with\\n      comparative ease.\" I must say my observations make me agree with Dr.\\n      Mettler entirely; when one thinks how rapidly the mildest of cases assume\\n      pernicious forms, indifference is certainly no longer to be excused. There\\n      is a voluminous literature upon this subject, and many and varied are the\\n      aetiological reasons given for this very variable affection, a large\\n      majority of writers coinciding in the opinion that \"many causes\\n      operate together,\" to produce what we are pleased to designate the\\n      \"vomiting of pregnancy.\" I believe myself that in a large\\n      percentage of cases, this pernicious vomiting is simply the result of a\\n      reflex neurosis. Undoubtedly uterine displacements frequently cause\\n      vomiting; but when this is so, and the displaced organ is raised by\\n      packing the vagina with aseptic wool, the vomiting ceases.\\n      \\n Lillie reports a number of cases, where\\n      obstinate vomiting was caused by a retroflexed uterus, and restoration of\\n      the organ caused a cessation of the disorder. Bezugloff having a\\n      persistent case of morning sickness, introduced a bougie it no the uterus,\\n      the intention being to produce abortion; the immediate result was a\\n      stoppage of the vomiting, and the pregnancy went on to full term.\\n      \\n In the case just cited, I must say that\\n      I believe it was the fright, caused by the thought of abortion being\\n      performed, more than the effects of introducing the bougie, which operated\\n      so successfully; I say now, as I said before, I believe that the\\n      pre-eminent cause of this kind of sickness must be looked for i the\\n      nervous system. Flint speaks of this form of sickness as being decidedly\\n      neurotic in its origin, and cites a number of cases of a chronic variety\\n      of dyspepsia frequently occurring in young girls. I had one such case come\\n      under my personal care. There was a persistent morning sickness, with this\\n      young lady, and a disagreeable nausea whenever food was taken; this\\n      patient was at some distance from her home, in a boarding school, and she\\n      will probably never know that the lady principal entertained very grave\\n      thoughts at one time in regard to her virtue. It certainly was very\\n      difficult to differentiate between this and the vomiting of pregnancy; it\\n      was, however, simply due to a vitiated nervous system. My theory is\\n      supported by Alt, who records a number of such cases; I cite one only, the\\n      case being that of a highly hysterical woman, six months pregnant,\\n      suffering from the gravest vomiting, and anxious that miscarriage be\\n      induced. She was making preparation for entering the hospital for this\\n      purpose, when one of her children was seized with pneumonia. The anxiety\\n      felt over the child, forced all thought of self from the mother\\'s mind;\\n      from that moment the vomiting ceased and she remained well until the\\n      termination of pregnancy.-Minchener Medicinische Wochenschrift.\\n      \\n Whilst saying that I believe this\\n      disease to be in the majority of cases of purely nervous origin, I would\\n      not imply thereby that it is not to be feared, far from it; if neglected,\\n      we know how likely it is to pass quickly beyond treatment and our patient\\n      succumb from sheer exhaustion.\\n      \\n In the treatment cited such as\\n      insertion of bougies, dilation of the os, pelvic massage, etc., I believe\\n      it is merely the \"doing something,\" no matter much what it is,\\n      so long as you have gained the confidence of your patient, that does good.\\n      We have seen how suddenly Hyperemesis will cease if the patient be\\n      alarmed; it may be, has often been, and will to again, cured by a process\\n      skin to suggestion. Kattenback had a case where the patient, a primipara,\\n      was seized with an incorrigible vomiting. It was suggested to her that her\\n      stomach contained some lumps of unwholesome material and their removal\\n      would cure her. Some milk was given her, and the stomach ceremoniously\\n      washed out. its contents bore no indications of either over-acidity or\\n      abnormal ferment She was informed that she was all right and the vomiting\\n      would not return; neither did if, and she was safely delivered at term.\\n      \\n There is a familiar and now well-know\\n      phenomena, by which these neurotics can be influenced; I speak of\\n      hypnotism; it is due to purely subjective conditions.\\n      \\n There is an identity of the hypnotic\\n      susceptibility with the condition of hysteria, and it is along these lines\\n      that we can work. Just as many times as I have tried this method of\\n      treatment, for these cases of excessive vomiting, just so many times has\\n      it given me gratifying results.\\n      \\n The patient can be to sleep by\\n      bi-ocular pressure, and the idea of cure suggested; the operation may have\\n      to be repeated several times, at intervals of a day or so, but you will be\\n      rewarded by the cessation of the vomiting, often with but one suggestion.\\n      Where the patient is not easily controlled by means of the bi-ocular\\n      pressure, Luy\\'s revolving mirror is a never failing resource.'\n",
      " 'Tresorie - PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS [Presidential Address]\\n\\n THE ROLE OF HOMOEOPATHY IN THE SECOND\\n      \\n By ALVA BENJAMIN, M.B.CH.B., F.F.HOM.\\n      \\n Such a system of medicine must\\n      recognize that it is as much an art as a science, and that healing is a\\n      relationship between two living personalities. It must recognize too, that\\n      the sick individual has to take an active part in his treatment and not be\\n      merely the passive recipient of this or that treatment. For just as it is\\n      rightly said that man does not live by alone, so should it be emphasized\\n      that man cannot be cured by medicine alone. He must see to it himself that\\n      he lives as far as possible a physically and psychically healthy life.\\n      Indeed, each individual has a power within himself to help in his own\\n      cure.\\n      \\n Do the official schools of medicine\\n      teach such an art today? I am afraid not: they are so intent on seeking\\n      the specific treatment for this or that named disease or the antibiotic\\n      that will most effectively put out of action the organism regarded as the\\n      cause of the disease, that they are losing sight of the individual\\n      himself.\\n      \\n But Homoeopathy in its persistent\\n      search for the reactions of the individual to his environment in the\\n      broadest sense, no matter of what the patient is complaining surely\\n      fulfills these requirements, especially when it is recognized that the\\n      homoeopathic potencies do not anything to the patient as do the drugs of\\n      the dominant school, but rather stimulate the patients own recuperative\\n      powers to overcome the infection or re - establish the normal metabolism\\n      which has become deranged by the illness.\\n      \\n When you consider how the homoeopathic\\n      physician diagnoses the individuality of his patient over and above the\\n      name of the disease from which he is suffering, and uses for the purpose\\n      of his prescription rather than the name of the disease this personal\\n      diagnosis of the patients mental and emotional reactions, his responses to\\n      changes in weather conditions, the alternations in his environment which\\n      influence his symptoms, etc., one realize how very individualistic is the\\n      Homoeopathic prescription fitted to that particular patient.\\n      \\n The homoeopathic physician does not\\n      seek for a remedy specific to any named disease and which he can thus\\n      apply almost automatically once he has made his organic diagnosis, which\\n      in quite an appreciable number of instances may ultimately be found to be\\n      wrong and so the treatment based upon it must therefore have been wrong.\\n      He does not, as is so often done, merely suppress the most outstanding\\n      symptom by an appropriate drug; for example giving an anodyne to mask the\\n      pain or removing the skin eruption by some strong local application, in\\n      other words putting the dust under the mat and pretending the room is\\n      clean.\\n      \\n Strangely enough the homoeopathic\\n      physician is often accused by his allopathic critic in his ignorance of\\n      Homoeopathy, of merely treating symptoms, whereas it is the critic himself\\n      who practices this superficial medicine. The homoeopathic physician, on\\n      the other hand, treats his patient as a whole through his symptoms and\\n      their modifications through changes in the environment, which is quite a\\n      different matter.\\n      \\n Homoeopathic therapy, unlike methods of\\n      treatment, is based on a natural law \"Similia Similibus\\n      Curentur\" \"Likes may be cured by likes\" which has been\\n      proved time and time again by experiment and which anyone with the will to\\n      do may prove for himself. It is not subject to constant change brought\\n      about by this or that latest discovery, and which itself will soon have to\\n      give way to the still later idea.\\n      \\n Having now introduced to you our actor,\\n      what of the scene in which he is to play his role?\\n      \\n This is the nineteen hundred and fifty\\n      - fourth year of the Christian era and the second year of the reign of our\\n      much loved and admired young Queen Elizabeth II, who will remember while\\n      in south Africa on her twenty - first birthday, before she had any idea\\n      that she would so soon be called to such an exalted position as she holds\\n      today, broadcast to the commonwealth and Empire her resolve to dedicate\\n      her life to the service of this grand community which dedication she\\n      recently repeated at her Coronation.\\n      \\n Here in Great Britain we have a more or\\n      less complete welfare state, with which idea some of us may very strongly\\n      disagree, whilst others believe such a development is the result of a\\n      natural very desirable social evolution.\\n      \\n As one necessary ingredient of this\\n      welfare state came, in 1948, the initiation of the National Health\\n      Service, through which the great majority of the population receives its\\n      medical attention, although it is rightly available to all.\\n      \\n When we come to consider the role that\\n      homoeo - therapeutics should play in this scheme, I would suggest that we\\n      should regard the problem from the purely medical aspect, forgetting any\\n      political party allegiances or sympathies we may have; or if we cannot\\n      forget them we should remember that the organization of the National\\n      Insurance Scheme of which the National Health Service is but a part, was\\n      first blue printed by the well - known Liberal supporter, Lord Beveridge,\\n      and the Health Service plans developed by the Coalition Government of all\\n      three major political parties.\\n      \\n We are living at present in an age\\n      which may very justifiably be regarded as a violent age in which have been\\n      developed so many appalling instruments of destruction, the use of some of\\n      which we are quite complacently accepting and from the use of others we\\n      are refraining, not because we consider them immoral, but simply through\\n      the fear of the wholesale destruction which would be caused by their use.\\n      We are seeing X-rays used in very high voltages in the treatment of\\n      cancer, we are being constantly remained of the use of dangerous drugs in\\n      medicine, without justification, in my opinion, bearing in mind the\\n      doubtful and evanescent ameliorations they produce and the violent\\n      surgical treatment of mental patients.\\n      \\n One further violence we should not\\n      forget is the way some of our foods are devitalized by the extraction of\\n      this or that portion of the natural product for purposes quite foreign to\\n      the well - being of the people who are to feed on them; or they are\\n      contaminated by the addition of this or that dangerous chemical, either\\n      during the growing of the plant, in the form of sprays, or as so called\\n      improvers in, for instance, the manufacture of white bread. It is very\\n      significant in this regard that quite a lot of attention is paid to the\\n      protection of the man who sprays the crops, but the right of the consumer\\n      to have uncontaminated food is slurred over by the unjustifiable statement\\n      that the amount of these chemicals so consumed is so small that it cannot\\n      have any bad effect on the consumer. We who practice Homoeopathy know how\\n      unwarranted is such a statement.\\n      \\n Can we homoeopathic physicians and\\n      patient hope to be able to do anything to make the still small voice of\\n      Homoeopathy heard in all this tumult, so that we may return to a saner and\\n      more healthful way of life and help our young Queen in her lifes work for\\n      the communitys sake?\\n      \\n Can we expect any help from the leaders\\n      of the medical profession? I am afraid not, because although I believe it\\n      accurate to state that there is a very slowly growing interest in, and\\n      tolerance of our work by individual doctors, the medical authorities are\\n      still, in their prejudice, strongly opposed to us. The London University\\n      still refuses to recognize our Hospital as a post - graduate teaching\\n      Hospital: the British Medical Association prohibits the formation of a\\n      homoeopathic section of its organization, and the Royal College of\\n      Physicians still refuses its membership to any one known as a homoeopathic\\n      physician. Yet in spite of this unfavourable environment, I firmly believe\\n      that there is a future for our method of therapeutics: but it will have to\\n      be pursued with courage, determination, foresight and energy. Surely if we\\n      believe as I do, that we are the guardians of a system of treatment\\n      destined to make our people healthier and therefore more efficient and\\n      happier, we would be failing in our duty to our country if we did not take\\n      every means in our power to acquaint the community at large with the\\n      advantages of this system and the dangers of ignoring it. This is a duty,\\n      not only of the profession, but also of the laity interested in\\n      Homoeopathy and who have experienced its benefits.\\n      \\n Every physician has two professional\\n      obligation to the community, that of preserving its health and that of\\n      endeavouring to restore it to being when it has fallen by the way.\\n      \\n The homoeopathic physician, thorough\\n      his knowledge acquired through the provings of drugs, even in\\n      infinitesimal doses, has, I believe, a very special responsibility as\\n      regards the prophylaxis of disease. It seems to me that a great deal of\\n      chronic ill health may quite conceivably be due to the manipulations of\\n      our foods and to the artificial manuring of the ground in which many of\\n      them are grown. Experiments have been carried our proving that plants\\n      grown in soil enriched by natural manuring, are much less prone to\\n      diseases than those grown with the help of artificial chemical manures. It\\n      seems a fairly justified conclusion that vegetables grown under these\\n      artificial conditions may quite well be deficient in something necessary\\n      for our perfect health. It is therefore incumbent upon the physician to\\n      advocate whenever possible the ingestion of healthily grown foods in the\\n      widest sense of that term.\\n      \\n The same duty applies when we consider\\n      the great amount of drugging in which the community at large indulges by\\n      its excessive smoking, particularly when aggravated by the practice of\\n      inhaling, and by the continued and prolonged use of drugs for this or that\\n      symptom, too often, unfortunately, though not always, on the prescription\\n      of their medical advisors.\\n      \\n There is a great lack throughout the\\n      community of any real enthusiasm for perfect health: we are only too prone\\n      to be content to follow like sheep, the unintelligent and harmful\\n      practices of the majority of our fellows.\\n      \\n Similarly in the curative realm, we\\n      homoeopathic physicians have special obligations.\\n      \\n When considering our position vis-a-vis\\n      the rest of the profession, we must never lose sight of the fact that our\\n      approach to the sick individual is a much broader and more comprehensive\\n      one than that of the dominant school. This latter prides itself on its\\n      scientific approach to its problems. One must, however, always be on ones\\n      guard against being hypnotized by that word scientific. The scientific\\n      aspect of any phenomenon or problem dealing with humanity is only one\\n      limited aspect of that problem. To get a complete picture one must\\n      consider other aspect, such as the aesthetic, emotional, maybe religious,\\n      and above all, perhaps one might say embracing all, the philosophical\\n      approach. This complex approach to his patients problem is the one that\\n      the homoeopathic physician always strives to adopt, and so never loses\\n      sight of the ego of the patient, while at the same time not forgetting his\\n      physical make - up.\\n      \\n Because this approach of ours to our\\n      patients is a much broader and more comprehensive one than the much\\n      vaunted scientific aspect, which the dominant school has come to regard as\\n      the Ultima Thule of medicine, I deplore the oft - repeated request of some\\n      of my colleagues that we should forsake our philosophy and make our work\\n      as scientific as theirs. I do not mean to imply by this that we should\\n      neglect the scientific angle of our patients illness but we should always\\n      remember that is only one facet of our problem. That is why we take such\\n      pains to diagnose our patients personality with his reaction to his\\n      environment in addition to the physical diagnosis of the case in order to\\n      arrive at our prescription for his malady. In other words, we should\\n      endeavour to lead our dominant school colleagues to our way of thinking,\\n      rather than that we should adopt theirs.\\n      \\n At the same time must always remember\\n      that if our philosophy should seem at any time to contradict so - called\\n      scientific laws, we must re - examine our philosophy, and if necessary\\n      modify it, while at the same time remembering that many times in the past\\n      what have been regarded as laws have ultimately been proved not to be so.\\n      Thus it is evident that we must never relax our self - examination.\\n      \\n What shall be the role of the\\n      homoeopathic laity?\\n      \\n The first thing for them to remember is\\n      that we are living in a democratic country whose government is dependent\\n      on the goodwill of the governed, and that, if a sufficient number of\\n      voters desire a certain line of action, that line will be adopted by the\\n      government.\\n      \\n The second thought is that there are\\n      not nearly sufficient doctors practising Homoeopathy in Great Britain to\\n      satisfy the present demand, let alone any further increased demand in the\\n      future, for this line of treatment.\\n      \\n Does not this seem strange, having\\n      regard to the great advantage to humanity that Homoeopathy provides? Not\\n      if one looks below the surface and so finds the reason for this shortage.\\n      \\n Surely the most potent reason is that\\n      Homoeopathy is not taught in the official Medical Schools, either as a pre\\n      - or post - graduate study. The London University when asked to recognize\\n      the Royal London Homoeopathic Hospital as a post - graduate Medical\\n      School, refused on the plea that as Homoeopathy was not taught in the\\n      undergraduate Medical Schools, it could not find a place for it in its\\n      post - graduate curriculum.\\n      \\n It is, of course, nonsense to suggest\\n      that a graduate should pursue his studies only in those subject of which\\n      he had already obtained some knowledge in his undergraduate days and\\n      should not wish to obtain information on any new or extra subject.\\n      \\n The University Medical Shools are\\n      enabled to a great extent through Government grants. We must therefore\\n      find some way of influencing whatever Government be in power to bring\\n      pressure to bear upon the London University to remove this obstacle to the\\n      better health of the community at large. I am quite satisfied that once\\n      this academic recognition is obtained we shave many more post - graduate\\n      students of Homoeopathy.\\n      \\n I believe than in a democratic\\n      community, having a universal State Medical Service, it is the bounden\\n      duty of the Government to remove all obstacles to the peoples obtaining\\n      that form of medical treatment in which they have confidence. So long as\\n      Homoeopathy is denied its legitimate status, so long must be Government be\\n      deemed to b failing in its duty to the country.\\n      \\n If, however, we are to achieve this\\n      desirable object of full recognition, we must all, professional and laity,\\n      be fired with enthusiasm, not only for the abstract cause of Homoeopathy,\\n      but for being partners with our young Queen in delicating our lives to the\\n      community.\\n      \\n When we do this we shall help to make\\n      this second Elizabethan era one to be remembered throughout the ages to\\n      come as surpassing the first Elizabethan era in that it gained not so much\\n      the economic and political leadership of the world - though that is not to\\n      be despised - but showed the way to the most healthful and spiritual way\\n      of life that all the world look notice and followed suit.\\n      \\n To sum up, the Role of Homoeopathy, as\\n      I see it, is to humanize the practice of medicine. By that I mean it must\\n      bring the practice of medicine into line with a reasoned philosophy of\\n      life, restore to it its artistry and rid it of all unnecessary hazards. It\\n      is to do this, not from any abstract academic sense of superiority, but in\\n      order the years to come are not those of merely another reign, but to\\n      ensure a veritable Renaissance, starting with the second Elizabethan era\\n      in which Great Britain will take its rightful place in the comity of\\n      nations as the pathfinder to a way of life for which posterity will be\\n      able to say \"Thank God for Queen Elizabeth the Second and her\\n      peoples.'\n",

Lafield, who was Professor of\\n      Roentgenology at the Yale Medical School.\\n      \\n Some of the reasons why roentgen\\n      pelvimetry has not been more universally adopted are probably due to the\\n      following factors.\\n      \\n (1) The majority of women will be\\n      delivered normally, whether or not pelvic measurements are made.\\n      \\n (2) The medical profession does not\\n      readily accept a new method after an established satisfactory routine has\\n      been in use.\\n      \\n (3) A new method of diagnosis incurs\\n      added expense.\\n      \\n (4) The present methods, although\\n      entirely speculative, are satisfactory in most cases.\\n      \\n (5) Roentgen pelvimetry cannot be\\n      performed by the obstetrician himself but requires the aid of a\\n      roentgenologist.\\n      \\n (6) The value of roentgenometric\\n      diagnosis is recent in origin and as yet not universally accepted.\\n      \\n If the knowledge of the size and shape\\n      of the pelvis is necessary to the practice of obstetrics, roentgen\\n      pelvimetry is a sound procedure, particularly in pre-emptors patients, and\\n      should and should be considered as an indispensable aid in these cases.\\n      \\n The method of Herbert Thoms as\\n      developed at Yale Medical School is not the only method. However, it can\\n      be classified as simple, accurate and rapid; being adaptable for use by\\n      other than experts in x-ray and obstetric diagnosis. As a technical\\n      procedure a well trained hospital technician can master its technic alter\\n      sufficient instruction.\\n      \\n Studies of recent years reveal the fact\\n      that external Pelvimetry fails to give uniform and accurate information in\\n      regard to the shape and size of the superior strait. This is often true of\\n      thin undersized individuals. In many patients of this type external\\n      measurements may suggest a contracted pelvis while the x-ray will show a\\n      relatively large pelvis with a subsequent natural labor and normal-sized\\n      child. On the other hand a stocky short person with similar external\\n      measurements will disclose a contracted pelvis which is an obstetric\\n      problem. Because of the apparent relationship between shortening of the\\n      transverse diameter and a secondary persistent occipito-posterior\\n      presentation, accurate information regarding this diameter is of clinical\\n      significance.\\n      \\n The observations of Thomas were made on\\n      twenty consecutive patients whose pelvis showed a relative or real\\n      shortening of the transverse diameter of the superior strait. In every\\n      instance a primary or secondary occipito posterior position was found\\n      after the patient was in labor. (Herbert Thoms, Surgery, Gynecology and\\n      Obstetrics, January, 1933). It therefore has been proved that an actual or\\n      relative shortening of a transverse diameter of the superior strait\\n      results in a limitation of space that is greater in the anterior than in\\n      the posterior half of the superior strait. Under these circumstances, when\\n      the head descends early in labor, the occiput is forced to rotate\\n      posteriorly.\\n      \\n The x-ray offers additional information\\n      in determining the size of the fetal head. It has been noted in x-ray\\n      examination of the unengaged fetal head that it lay with the transverse\\n      diameter of the superior strait, the occiput being either to the right or\\n      left; therefore, if roentgenogram of the patient is taken in the supine\\n      position with the fetus in the uterus, it will cast a shadow which is an\\n      enlarged profile of the head. The measurements of the occipital frontal\\n      diameter of the head can then be made. On numerous occasions this method\\n      of cephalometry, determining the diameter of the unmoulded head before and\\n      after cesarean section, has yielded accurate results. (Thomas, A.M.A.,\\n      February 24, 1934).\\n      \\n As experience increases in roentgen\\n      pelvimetry, the so-called labor test will be employed less. This, however,\\n      does not mean that the physician should not under estimate the importance\\n      of uterine contraction and the ability of the fetal head to mold. It has\\n      always followed that when something could be proved desirable in medicine\\n      for the better protection of the patient, such an advance would be\\n      demanded and eventually become routine. We may concede, therefore, that\\n      roentgen pelvimetry has a distinct place in the examination of every\\n      primiparous woman. In many instances, according to Thomas and others,\\n      external; measurements were normal but the x-ray examination revealed a\\n      contracted pelvis. On the other had, in certain patients whose external\\n      measurements suggested a cesarean section roentgen pelvimetry proved\\n      otherwise and they were subsequently delivered in a normal manner.\\n      \\n CENTIMETER GRID METHOD.\\n      \\n The procedure in this method may be\\n      summarized by stating the following:.\\n      \\n (1) The patient is placed on the\\n      roentgenographic table in the semi- recumbent position.\\n      \\n (2) The level of the superior strait\\n      above the sensitized film is established.\\n      \\n (3) The tube target is centered about\\n      five centimeters posterior to the symphysis, at thirty-two inches from the\\n      sensitized film, The exposure is made.\\n      \\n (4) The patient is removed from the\\n      table, the tube target and sensitized film remaining in situ.\\n      \\n (5) A lead plate, or centimeter grid,\\n      with perforations exactly one centimeter apart, is introduced into the\\n      same plane as that previously occupied by the superior strait and a second\\n      (flash) exposure is made on the same sensitized film as was used used in\\n      the previous exposure.\\n      \\n (6) Development of the film shows the\\n      outline of the superior strait and the shadows of the perforations, the\\n      assistance between which represents centimeters in the plane of the\\n      superior strait. The anteroposterior and transverse diameters of the\\n      superior strait in its use proportions may be drawn on centimeter-square\\n      paper by following the course of the shadow of the superior strait and\\n      transcribing it.\\n      \\n As this time I wish to express my\\n      thanks to Dr. Thoms for his personal advice and instruction which helped\\n      me to master the technic of his method.'\n",

      " 'Tresorie - THE EFFICACY OF THE VIBROMETER IN APPLYING VIBRATORY MASSAGE\\nIN AURAL DISEASES [Efficacy Of Vibrometer In Applying Vibratory Message In Aural\\nDisease]\\n\\n SINCE presenting my paper before the\\n      American Institute, in June of last year on \"Vibratory Motion as a\\n      Method of Massage in Aural Diseases,\" I have been using an instrument\\n      specially devised for that purpose called the \"vibrometer.\" This\\n      instrument is in shape like a banjo, and has four strings stretched across\\n      its length resting on a bridge, which sets upon a diaphragm. On each side,\\n      elevated above the diaphragm and supported by posts, are two horizontal\\n      bars, which support the mechanical appliances used for producing the\\n      various vibratory motions. This consists in what is called a yoke, in\\n      which revolves a shaft connected with the electro-motor by pulley-wheels\\n      and a belt. Behind the diaphragm is a shallow air-tight compartment,\\n      leading from which are rubber tubes that are inserted in the external\\n      auditory canal during treatment, consequently any vibratory motion of the\\n      diaphragm, which must necessarily be an inward and a corresponding outward\\n      movement, would be exactly reproduced upon the membrana tympani, as the\\n      confined air, not being able to escape, will undergo an alternate\\n      condensation and rarefication in the external auditory canal.\\n      \\n Every vibratory movement of the strings\\n      of the instrument is communicated to the diaphragm by means of the bridge\\n      upon which it rests. These strings by varying their tension and length can\\n      be regulated to give a high or low rate of vibration as desired, for\\n      instance, the heaviest string left at its original length adjusted to a\\n      slight tension may make about fifty vibratory motions to the second, while\\n      the highest string on the instrument adjusted to a high tension and\\n      clamped down to one-fourth its original length would probably make three\\n      thousand vibratory motions to the second.\\n      \\n In the centre of the diaphragm is an\\n      attachment which works on a lever, and when hit by the cam on the\\n      revolving shaft lifts the diaphragm to a considerable extent, causing a\\n      powerful effect on the membrana tympani. This attachment can be adjusted\\n      at four different leverages, which causes a modification or increase of\\n      its intensity and can be regulated at from one to twenty-five vibratory\\n      movements to the second. This is only used in very bad cases and for not\\n      more than five minutes continuously.\\n      \\n The instrument which I have been\\n      describing in an improvement on the first manufactured, and as far as I\\n      know, is the only one which offers the same facilities for applying this\\n      method of massage. The class of patients in my experience who are\\n      generally benefited from the first, are those in which the mucous membrane\\n      lining the tympanic cavity and Eustachian tubes is in a hypertrophic\\n      condition. The membrana tympani are depressed, opaque, and thickened. They\\n      usually complain of a stiffed sensation in the ears, with a great deal of\\n      tinnitus aurium, and that their hearing is worse during a cold. In cases\\n      where the mucous membranes are atrophied with a large external auditory\\n      canal perfectly dry and Eustachian tubes patulous, and generally very\\n      little tinnitus, this or no other treatment has done very much good in the\\n      majority of cases, and in looking ever my records I find that only about\\n      five per cent. have been relieved, while in the before-mentioned cases the\\n      good results reach at least seventy-five per cent. In treating persons, I\\n      always select the rate of vibration which corresponds in pitch, if\\n      possible, to that caused by the diseased condition of the ears. If there\\n      is no tinnitus to guide me, I find whether the patient can hear a high or\\n      low sound better; if it is a low sound, a high rate of vibration is used\\n      in treatment, and vice versa, A point which I would like to explain here\\n      is this: It is not necessary that the sound from the instrument should be\\n      of the same quality of the tinnitus experienced by the patient, but merely\\n      the same pitch. for instance, if a banjo, where one of the strings was\\n      adjusted when sounded to produce a certain note, and a musical instrument\\n      of any other kind, whose quality of tone was entirely different, was made\\n      to sound the same note in a room, the string on the banjo would vibrate in\\n      sympathy, which has been proven by experiment, any other note, no matter\\n      how loud, would have no effect. Another point is in the way the strings of\\n      the vibrometer are set in motion. On the revolving shaft is a wheel\\n      projecting from which are metallic picks which hit the string it is\\n      adjusted over. It does not make any difference in the number of vibratory\\n      motions per second, whether the string is hit fast or slow, but at the\\n      time the string is first hit the intensity is greater than it is just\\n      before being hit again, and as the motion of the wheel is perfectly\\n      rhythmic, revolving so many times to the second, it has just as good an\\n      effect as if the intensity during the fraction of a second did not vary at\\n      all. The idea of using vibratory motion, as I have said before, originated\\n      within my mind some years ago, and later put into practical operation, and\\n      as far as I know, was the first to lay before the profession in a\\n      scientific manner, this method of massage.\\n      \\n I have found that when two of the\\n      strings upon the vibrometer were regulated in such a way that when both\\n      were set in vibration at the same time, producing the sensation of a\\n      harmonious sound, the effect in some cases on the tinnitus was especially\\n      beneficial, relieving, where the various kinds of vibrations produced by a\\n      single string failed. Sub-acute cases of deafness, accompanied by tinnitus\\n      aurium, are quickly relieved, as the following case will illustrate:.\\n      \\n Mrs. M. Young, married lady, aet. 26,\\n      called at my office, April 1, 1893, complaining of partial deafness and\\n      tinnitus aurium. She had a stuffed sensation, or as if cotton had been\\n      packed in the external auditory canal. She says the tinnitus was so\\n      annoying as to prevent sleep. On examination, found considerable\\n      retraction of the membrana tympani, and hearing for the watch, on the\\n      right side five inches, on the left, seven inches. The Eustachian tube\\n      were partially closed, which made inflation somewhat difficult, giving\\n      slight relief. I used several of the vibrations on the different strings\\n      without immediate benefit.\\n      \\n April 4th.-She came again, and reported\\n      that no improvement had taken place. I again inflated her ears, after\\n      which she sat down to the vibrometer. The central attachment was used with\\n      considerable force continuously for four minutes, after which she declared\\n      that the tinnitus had entirely ceased in the right ear, and greatly\\n      modified in the left; the hearing for the watch had increased for both\\n      ears to fourteen inches, and the stuffed sensation had almost entirely\\n      disappeared. On inspection of the membrana tympani, found them\\n      comparatively very slightly retracted. On April 8th, found improvement had\\n      continued, when the same treatment was used for three minutes; after which\\n      she declared herself completely relieved of the tinnitus and stuffed\\n      sensation, with hearing powerfully restored. Saw her again on April 13th,\\n      when she declared the good results from last treatment to have still\\n      continued.\\n      \\n I find that in the majority of cases,\\n      when the strings of the instrument are used it is only necessary to strike\\n      them lightly with the friction wheel. In vibrating the heavy string, I\\n      generally set the bridge back behind the central attachment, and adjusting\\n      the motor in such way that the belt is at a considerable tension, so that\\n      the pulley-wheel revolves slowly. I also generally use this adjustment\\n      when setting in motion two strings at one time. The principle of this\\n      method of treatment embraces two essential features which to my mind makes\\n      this system of massage the only scientific one applicable to the membrana\\n      tympani and its associate sound-conducting parts. Message is the\\n      application of motion to disease, and its scientific administration\\n      consists of its application in a systematic manner. In applying massage in\\n      aural diseases, it is necessary to produce a to-and-fro movement of the\\n      membrana tympani, and, if possible, by a force which is harmless and at\\n      the same time effective. The vibrometer fulfils these conditions. Any of\\n      the strings on the instrument that may be set in motion by the\\n      friction-wheel, will produce a certain number of vibratory movements to\\n      the second of time, and the movements of the central attachment are also\\n      measured. What could be more systematic than this? The motions of the\\n      membrana tympani were intended by nature to its vibratory, and as the\\n      vibrometer generates measured motion, and these motions are vibratory,\\n      theoretically we have a scientific and effective method of massage in\\n      aural diseases; and, as demonstrated practically by the use of the\\n      vibrometer, we have in fact a great scientific advance over all previous\\n      methods. Since the introduction of this treatment in aural diseases, it\\n      makes possible a more or less benefit in cases of deafness heretofore\\n      considered hopeless, and has opened up the field for the treatment of\\n      aural diseases to such an extent that the number of deaf patients seeking\\n      relief at the aurist\\'s hands will at least double itself.\\n      \\n DISCUSSION.\\n      \\n H.C. HOUGHTON, M.D.: Dr. Garey\\'s\\n      admirable paper gives us the description of the vibrometer, an instrument\\n      devised under his personal direction and inspection, for the purpose of\\n      applying massage to the ear. It is the only instrument of the kind on the\\n      market, so far as I am aware, and after a somewhat prolonged use of it, I\\n      am prepared to recommend the latest production of the vibrometer company.\\n      \\n This instrument is a decided\\n      improvement over the instrument first sent out, and is capable of\\n      producing a most profound effect upon the drum-head and ossicula; indeed,\\n      upon the entire auditory apparatus. I am able to confirm Dr. Garey\\'s\\n      statement of the effect of high and low vibrations us regards treatment.\\n      \\n I have also been very much interested\\n      in the use of stringed or reed instruments for diagnosis, and find that we\\n      can detect any abnormal sensitiveness of the auditory nerve to high or low\\n      tones. Some patients are extremely sensitive to all tones, high or low;\\n      others to high tones and not to low tones; others, conversely. Again, in\\n      some instances, there is a peculiar sensitiveness to single tones or to\\n      discords produced by sounding the note and half-note at the same time.\\n      Under the action of the central attachment of the vibrometer this\\n      sensitiveness is modified, the sensitiveness to high tones disappearing\\n      and being replaced by a low tone or, conversely, under treatment, a low\\n      tone disappears and a high tone is established, temporarily, at least.\\n      Again, in cases of recent origin, treatment will substitute an undefined\\n      rushing sound for a definite musical tone, either high or low, and later,\\n      the treatment will abolish this, the patient being relieved of this\\n      intensely annoying symptom. In some cases, with this relief, there is an\\n      improvement in the audition; in other cases, no improvement follows.\\n      \\n I confess to the domination of the\\n      material over my mind in my earlier experience with massage, and I think\\n      the inclination of operators will be to use a far greater degree of power\\n      than is necessary. I therefore notice with great satisfaction Professor\\n      Garey\\'s remark that \"the object should be to produce a to-and-fro\\n      motion to the membrana tympani, and, if possible, by a force which is\\n      harmless and at the same time effective.\" I would hardly say\\n      \"to-and-fro motion of the drum-head,\" because I think that the\\n      expression is liable to perpetuate the motion which is fixed in the minds\\n      of most physiologists, that the drum-head moves as a whole, with a\\n      to-and-fro motion.\" That is true under the influence of the Politzer,\\n      Siegle\\'s otoscope and similar instruments; but it certainly does not so\\n      move in the ordinary function of audition, but stands as the iris does in\\n      the eye, as an adjustor, a regulator of sound-force; in some sense as the\\n      iris does in its relation with the lens, to adjust, regulate and direct\\n      the essential force, and the vibration of the drum-head is at every node;\\n      every portion receives impressions that are converted into molecular\\n      disturbances of varying lengths, according as they are produced upon the\\n      stiff and unyielding portions of the drum-head at the periphery, along the\\n      manubrium, or in the more attenuated and easily-yielding portions which\\n      the between these two areas. Not only so, but these impulses are\\n      communicated to the contained air of the tympanum, and make their\\n      impression upon the acoustic nerve through the round window synchronously\\n      with the impression made through the ossicula.\\n      \\n This whole subject widens before my\\n      mind in such a way that one might wish himself twenty years and at liberty\\n      to devote himself to a term of research in acoustics, such as is offered\\n      only in the technical schools of the continent of Europe.\\n      \\n WM. R. KING, M.D.: In discussing Dr.\\n      Garey\\'s paper I shall begin by saying that his methods have been closely\\n      followed by me since the beginning of his experiments, owing to the fact\\n      that I have been greatly interested in the treatment of deafness and\\n      tinnitus by means of sound waves or by aural massage since 1887, and have\\n      experimented and treated many cases by this method since then, though with\\n      crude and unsatisfactory instruments. Since using the vibrometer-which,\\n      after much study and experimentation, is now presented to the profession\\n      in practical shape-I have undoubtedly increased my percentage of good\\n      results.\\n      \\n I don\\'t believe I am over-sanguine or\\n      carried away by interest in this method, and believe I can rightly\\n      appreciate that this does not offer us a panacea or cure-all for auditory\\n      ailments, and hope I may always be ready to see the failures and to strive\\n      to find methods or remedies to reach some of them.\\n      \\n In speaking of the application of the\\n      instrument, I wish to call attention to the central attachment or post foe\\n      vibrations. Dr. Garey has not given it as much attention in the paper as\\n      it deserves. It is very useful as a general means of aural massage,\\n      rougher in nature and more general in application than the strings which\\n      help to make up the instrument. I often use it before applying the\\n      \"similar found\" to a given case, as a species of gymnastics, to\\n      stimulate secretion and motion in the conducting apparatus of the ear,\\n      viz., membrana tympani and ossicles. In most cases-in fact, in all-where\\n      tinnitus is present, I follow this up immediately by the nearest approach\\n      to the similar pitch obtainable.\\n      \\n I agree thoroughly with Dr. Garey, that\\n      the best results are achieved in cases accompanying hypertrophic catarrh,\\n      and that the least benefit is apparent in cases of atrophic nature.\\n      \\n Regarding the method of treatment in\\n      the absence of tinnitus, my experience the does not coincide with that of\\n      the author of the paper entirely; I do not feel that as yet we have any\\n      safe rule to guide us. My method has been to try the numerous sounds and\\n      variations the of until I find the one that seems to give the best\\n      immediate results, or that the patient himself will speak of as very\\n      penetrating and powerful )though not necessarily loud and heavy).\\n      \\n It seems almost impossible at present\\n      to simulate all the qualities of tone as they occur in the ears of those\\n      suffering with tinnitus; in fact, it would appear to be unnecessary.\\n      However, it seems advantageous and quite necessary to secure the closest\\n      simulation of pitch, thus in many cases soon obliterating annoying\\n      tinnitus and improving hearing powers.\\n      \\n The arrangement permitting of the\\n      picking of two strings simultaneously adds decidedly the usefulness of the\\n      instrument, as it increases the range of pitch as well as varying the\\n      quality of tones procurable, thereby decidedly enlarging our field of\\n      application.\\n      \\n The force used for creating the message\\n      or gymnastics of the membrana tympani and the ossicles-viz, vibratory\\n      force or sound- carefully and scientifically applied, is nature\\'s remedy,\\n      because it is adapted by nature, and is the only force which can rightly\\n      or safely be applied to these delicate portions of this complex organ of\\n      hearing.\\n      \\n A startling commentary on this subject\\n      is the array of cases benefited who have been relegated to the shelf by\\n      ancient and modern otology; cases declared unhelpable have been vastly\\n      improved. Pray, make no mistake; I did not say all cases.\\n      \\n It may be interesting to hear the\\n      latest regarding the instrument which was first invented for the\\n      application of this method of aural massage Mr. E.J. Godman, the inventor\\n      and patentee, is constantly on the lookout, and always striving for\\n      improvements to his machine. He has made many that you all know of. Permit\\n      me to report a few so recent they have not yet left the factory.\\n      \\n First.-The machine has been taken from\\n      its case, and is now mounted on a solid stand or table of oak, being set\\n      below the level, or so that the face of the instrument is just level with\\n      the face of the table. This is all supported by rigid, solid metal legs,\\n      which absolutely prevent foreign vibrations.\\n      \\n Second.-The motor has been removed from\\n      its little shelf and relegated below the table. I t can be placed upon a\\n      box on the floor, a shelf against the wall, or, better yet, a shelf\\n      solidly attached to the metal supports of the table. A belt goes up\\n      through an aperture to a wheel on a shaft, the other extremity of which\\n      carries a wheel with a rubber tire (a friction wheel), which in its\\n      revolution, being in contact with a larger flat- surfaced wheel on the\\n      main shaft of the instrument, turns this in harmony with itself. This\\n      arrangement does away with the necessity of shifting the motor each time\\n      you wish to shift the carriage from one string to another- a consummation\\n      to be devoutly thankful for. The removal of the motor from the instrument\\n      as at present attached will recommend itself to all who have used the\\n      vibrometer, a great amount of undesirable jar being thus avoided.\\n      \\n Third.-Ratchet keys capable of very\\n      fine adjustment of tension of strings are now provided for the instrument.\\n      \\n Fourth.-A rheostadt or resistance-coil\\n      is now to be placed beneath the table between the storage battery and the\\n      switch, by this means enabling us to control the speed and number of\\n      revolutions to a nicety.\\n      \\n Other, though comparatively minor,\\n      improvements are being made, and others are contemplated, as, for\\n      instance, the substitution of a roughly corrugated rubber band for the\\n      picker on the wheel, thereby getting rid of the metallic sound of the\\n      picker on the wire strings.\\n      \\n I have experimented with a number of\\n      appliance for the production of the sounds and pitches that I have\\n      required, but I always fall back on the vibrometer, especially as at\\n      present constructed, for satisfactory work and results.\\n      \\n This instrument may be, and probably\\n      is, as yet, in its infancy. It, and the method it applies, can only be\\n      perfected by constant work and experimentation both on the part of the\\n      profession and of the manufacturers. Each improvement we can suggest, if\\n      it only should serve as a means of helping one solitary case, would be\\n      well worth our while.\\n      \\n The experiments being made by different\\n      methods for treating deafness by sound waves is indicative of the interest\\n      the profession has taken in the matter. It is indicative of a lack of\\n      something in our usual armamentarium which is greatly longed for by\\n      patient and doctor; that is, the means for making the deaf hear and for\\n      relieving distressing tinnitus. There has been a dearth in this direction,\\n      and perhaps there still is, but I believe fully that we have in aural\\n      massage by vibratory force a decided acquisition at our hands.\\n      \\n E. H. LINNELL., M.D.: I would simply\\n      like to ask Dr. King how long he uses the instrument, and whether he uses\\n      it according to the deafness.\\n      \\n DR. KING: Yes, decidedly. In an intense\\n      case of deafness I would have to use it a great deal longer. The central\\n      attachment I never carry over three or five minutes, and the whole\\n      treatment I don\\'t think is over carried over twenty or twenty-five minutes\\n      in one case, and usually averages from ten to fifteen.\\n      \\n HAROLD WILSON, M.D.: I have only to\\n      suggest, what I have elsewhere called attention to, the possibility of\\n      another mechanical device for securing vibratory motion. It is well known\\n      that in the make and break of a current of electricity, in the circuit of\\n      which there is a telephone, we get an influence upon the make and break of\\n      the current in the telephone. Now, it is a simple matter with which these\\n      makes and breaks are made as to obtaining any number of vibration that you\\n      wish. You may, by a mechanical device of some rotary motion, if you\\n      choose, make and break the current as rapidly as you please until you have\\n      reached several thousand vibrations a second, or you may even make the\\n      vibrations so slow us to be easily counted. The application of this\\n      suggestion has been put in force in my own practice, more or less, in the\\n      use of the telephone as connected with the induction-coil ordinary\\n      battery. The more intense the current, the more intense the sound. You can\\n      easily see that it is mere question of mechanics to secure these two\\n      sounds-intensity of vibration and rapidity of vibration. I will say,\\n      furthermore, that it has this advantage. There is no noise in the office,\\n      which I think is not altogether true of the vibrometer. I would suggest\\n      that so far as the vibrometer is concerned, if it could be made to be\\n      noiseless to anybody but the patient, it would be a decided improvement.\\n      In that respect the telephone is a decided improvement, because there is\\n      no noise except to the patient, because the noise is right at the ear of\\n      the patient. If I were seeking for a perfected instrument in this line, I\\n      would go outside of the banjo idea. As we have the most perfect writing\\n      machines, which have no connection with the ordinary method of writing,\\n      and sewing machines, which have no connection with sewing by hand, so it\\n      occurs to me that possibly the securing of he vibratory motion upon the\\n      ears might be obtained in a totally different way from that which you get\\n      when you listen to the drum of the guitar or an ordinary musical\\n      instrument, and I would suggest that the make and break of a telephone\\n      open a very fruitful field for mechanical experimentation.\\n      \\n H.C. HOUGHTON, M.D.: In my study of\\n      this subject I made the acquaintance of Mr. Bernhardt, of New York City,\\n      who is a personal friend of Mr. Emil Berliner, the inventor of the Emil\\n      Berliner Telephone, which is the instrument by which the Bell Telephone\\n      Company maintain their monopoly at present. Mr. Berliner is the inventor\\n      of the graphophone, and has, I think, covered this whole matter which Dr.\\n      Wilson has mentioned. As ordinary Bell telephone receiver is put into the\\n      circuit of an ordinary induction machine, and you can use it just as the\\n      English people use the audiometer, and as you remove the coil you modify\\n      the vibrations, which is covered with another disk and a tube, and that\\n      tube covered with a stethoscope tube, which is the same as we use for the\\n      phonograph or vibrometer, and, as Dr. Wilson has suggested, you can modify\\n      the intensity, and of course the whole matter is adjusted by the\\n      attachment of the cord, so that you can have fine vibrations. The\\n      intensity of the vibrations is regulated by the distance to which you\\n      uncover the cord. The only difficulty in the adjustment is that it has\\n      been so severe that it is really uncomfortable, and the noise of the\\n      instrument is reduced to the minimum for office use.\\n      \\n A.B. NORTON, M.D.: I will also add that\\n      in regard to the objection Dr. Wilson makes to the noise, there is no\\n      doubt it is an annoying thing in the office, and in that line I have some\\n      men at work on my suggestion. We are devising another machine, or\\n      instrument, which is to be entirely enclosed in a cabinet, so there will\\n      be no noise whatever in the room if it is made a success. The idea is a\\n      little crude, and I am quite uncertain whether it will amount to anything\\n      or not. Then, in the line of what Dr. King was speaking in regard to Mr.\\n      Goodwin-he called, at New York, to see me last week. I made two little\\n      suggestion to him, which I think would be in line with his advancement.\\n      One is the number of the picks. The present vibrometer has four picks I\\n      suggest the experiment of trying twelve or sixteen picks, which will make\\n      a more continuous sound; it may be of some value. Then, in regard to\\n      regulating the speed of the machine: you regulate that now by a series of\\n      buttons, so as to get three different speeds. We will have a very slight,\\n      intermediate speed, and a very rapid speed. My experience with the\\n      vibrometer is especially favorable. I think the idea is in the right\\n      direction, and it is simply a matter of instrumentation.']\n",

Dietary sources of vitamin C include fruits and vegetables, particularly citrus fruits such as oranges.Severe deficiency of vitamin C causes scurvy. Although rare, scurvy results in severe symptoms and can cause death. People with scurvy are treated with vitamin C and should be under medical supervision.Many uses for vitamin C have been proposed, but evidence of benefit in scientific studies is lacking. In particular, research on asthma, cancer, and diabetes remains inconclusive, and a lack of benefit has been found for the prevention of cataracts or heart disease.The use of vitamin C in the prevention or treatment of colds remains controversial. Extensive research has been conducted. Overall, vitamin C lacked an effect on the development of colds and on cold symptoms. However, the duration of the cold shortened slightly. Notably, people living in extreme circumstances, including soldiers in the subarctic, skiers, and marathon runners, had a 50% decrease in the risk of developing a cold. This area merits additional research and may be of particular interest to athletes or people in the military.'\n",

Vitamin B12 is frequently used in combination with other B vitamins in a vitamin B complex formulation. Vitamin B12 is important in DNA synthesis. Vitamin B12 is bound to the protein in food. Acid in the stomach releases B12 from protein during digestion. Once released, B12 combines with a substance called intrinsic factor (IF) before it is absorbed into the bloodstream.The human body stores several years\\' worth of vitamin B12 in the liver, so low levels in the body are rare. Decreases in vitamin B12 levels are more common in the elderly, HIV-infected persons, and vegetarians.

This is based on results. They are not\\n      hopeless cases; they are still hopeful and they get well under\\n      radiotherapy. This has happened during the last three years, not because I\\n      have changed any but because the method of radiotherapy has changed. A\\n      great change has taken place. First of all, radium and x-rays are no\\n      longer looked on a last resort.\".\\n      \\n The foregoing bears witness to the\\n      progress made in the field radiation therapy. The manufacture of more\\n      adequate apparatus and the improved technic in its use reflect this\\n      improvement. Machines are used generally delivering twenty to thirty\\n      milliamperes of current at 200 K.V., while machines operating at 750 to\\n      1,000 200 K.V., using lower milliamperes, have been installed in several\\n      places in this country. Since the question of increased voltages began to\\n      dominate the field, machines operating at 400 to 600 K.V., using sealed\\n      tubes, have been manufactured in this country as well as on the been\\n      manufactured in this country as well as on the continent. This higher\\n      powered machines occupy little more space than the usual 200 K.V. machine.\\n      \\n The effectiveness of these stronger\\n      radiations is thought to be due to (1) the increased penetration and its\\n      consequently larger percentage depth doses, (2) the supposed higher\\n      selective action of short have length radiation on malignant cells, and\\n      (3) greatly increased x-ray output. Clinics using super-voltages report\\n      that clinical results are somewhat better than those secured through the\\n      use of the lesser voltage machine.\\n      \\n Experimental effort, from the physical\\n      and biologic point of view, has been exerted to establish to standard\\n      basis for radiotherapy since Roentgens discovery thirtyfive years ago, and\\n      its application five years later. Radiotherapists have only recently begun\\n      to understand the principles of clinical application or radiotherapy in\\n      the treatment of malignant conditions.\\n      \\n Regaud selected the rabbits testicle\\n      for his experiments because its histologic cellular structure was highly\\n      sensitive to radiation, containing cells which are in a state of active\\n      mitosis resembling that of malignant tissue. In 1922, Regaud reported that\\n      of malignant, tissue. In 1922, Regaud reported that it was impossible to\\n      sterilize the testicle by a single dose of radiation without causing\\n      serious damage to the overlying skin. The dose required to produced such\\n      radio necrosis was equivalent to about three radionecrosis was equivalent\\n      to about three erythemas when administered in one dose. However, by\\n      dividing the dose in such a manner as to prolong the treatment over a\\n      period of fourteen days, a total dose of about five erythemas could be\\n      given causing complete sterilizations without damage to the skin. Thus it\\n      is seen that by prolonging the time of treatment the cutaneous dose could\\n      be increased nearly 50 per cent without causing necrosis.\\n      \\n The above experiments were reported,\\n      and the same results determined, by Schinz and Slotopolsky in 1926, and\\n      again by Regaud and Ferroux in 1927. These experiments formed the\\n      foundation for the clinical studies of Pfahler (America), Hohlfelder\\n      (Germany) and Coutard (France), who have swung the pendulum from massive\\n      radiation, as advocated by the German school, to that of the protected\\n      fractional dose method. Results have been achieved by this method which\\n      are superior to previously reported; these are obtained by the improved\\n      method of administering a large dose to the (3 days) without causing\\n      destructive effects to the surroundings normal structure (or cancer bed);\\n      its effect are rather biologic than physical. The clinical application of\\n      the method of radiation by Pfahler, Countard, and Berven (Sweden) in the\\n      treatment of cancer of the tonsil, pharynx and larynx and have proved the\\n      radio-sensitive properties of squamous carcinoma, previously considered\\n      incapable of of responding to radiation.\\n      \\n According to Coutard, the neoplasm is\\n      exposed to x-rays twice daily, giving a total dose of 350 r to400 r to two\\n      areas, using 190 to 200 k.v., four milliamperes, two millimeters of copper\\n      and three millimeters of aluminum filtration at a distance of fifty of\\n      sixty centimeters, for lesion of the head and neck. For deeply situated\\n      lesions, such as cancer of the uterus, the focal distance varies from 80\\n      to 100 centimeters, the area of the field for the head and neck conditions\\n      being only 50 to 100 square centimeters, while those of the lower abdomen\\n      require on an average of 250 to 300 square centimeters. For the\\n      sterilization of the radio-sensitive squamous carcinomatous growth, a\\n      depth dose of 3,000 r to 4,000 r is given, while stronger dose is\\n      necessary for the radio-resistant tumors.\\n      \\n In the course of treatment of principle\\n      guides a radio reaction of the covering epithelium and the radio reaction\\n      of the cancer cells. The radio reaction of the cutaneous epithelium is\\n      called \"radio epidermitis.\"characterized by loss of epithelial\\n      layers and denudation of the dermis. The reaction of the mucous membrane ,\\n      called \"radio epithelitis,\" manifests itself by loss of the\\n      epithelial layer sand denudation of the mucous membrane, epithelial layers\\n      and denudation of the corium which becomes covered by a fibrinous and\\n      false membrane; of clear. The duration of both describe radio reactions is\\n      six weeks. Each appears at the beginning of three weeks and disappears at\\n      the beginning of the ninth week.\\n      \\n Should the total or daily dose or the\\n      intensity per minute be too high, or the filtration or the tension too\\n      low, the cancer bed would be modified. the nutrition of the malignant\\n      cells becomes impaired The cellular radio- sensitivity, which seems to be\\n      linked up not only with the mitosis of the cell but above all with the\\n      activity of their interchange with the cell but above all with the\\n      activity of their interchange with the surrounding normal structures,\\n      becomes diminished and at times suppressed. The cancer cells become\\n      incentive to radiation. This phenomenon is called \"radio-\\n      vaccination\" by Regaud.\\n      \\n Observation of clinical facts shows\\n      that changes in the surrounding normal tissue result from excessive daily\\n      doses and intensity per minute per minute causing radio resistance of the\\n      tissue. Conversely, radio- sensitivity would be prolonged with a smaller\\n      daily dosage and the resultant extended period.\\n      \\n Realizing that better results may be\\n      obtained by prolonged treatment, Coutard and his collaborators in the last\\n      few years have begun to extend the duration of treatment of certain\\n      so-called radio-resistant cancers from thirty to ninety days, giving weak\\n      daily doses in order of about 175, 220, 225 and 250 r per day, dividing\\n      the dose in two treatments. By this method he was able to cure a certain\\n      number of lesions on which he had not been able previously to obtain the\\n      same results, such as very differentiated epidermoid epithelioma invading\\n      the muscles and cartilages, glandular epithelioma of the breast ad the\\n      thyroid body, and special round celled epitheliomas of the upper part of\\n      the ethmoid and the adjacent sinuses. This mode of prolonged treatment not\\n      only controlled the condition locally but it lessened the frequency of\\n      metastasis.\\n      \\n When radiating a cancer of very\\n      embryonic, very radio-sensitive growths, the energy factor is predominant.\\n      The action of the x-rays seems to be direct and rapid; the treatment can\\n      be accomplished within fifteen to twenty days. The cells are destroyed and\\n      generally normal structures are affected very little. When radiating the\\n      less embryonic type of growths, the time of treatment should be longer.\\n      \\n Pursuing these general principles, I\\n      have adopted the Countard method with some slight modifications. The cures\\n      which I shall illustrate will show that the percentage of cures in a\\n      number of most dangerous epidermoid carcinomas has markedly increased and\\n      that some conditions formerly considered hopeless have been temporarily\\n      cured. In conclusion I wish to emphasize the following facts:.\\n      \\n (1) Cure of cancer by x-rays is still\\n      difficult and must not be entered into lightly and causally.\\n      \\n (2) Radiotherapy is just as radical in\\n      method as surgery, and requires great skill, judgment and experience.\\n      \\n (3) The cooperation of the pathologist\\n      and the radiotherapist is imperative for a proper estimate of the\\n      radio-sensitivity in relation to treatment of the lesion.\\n      \\n (4) Daily examination of the patient is\\n      necessary; modification of the normal structure and general reaction by\\n      the x-ray treatment sometimes appears to quickly that it is often\\n      necessary to diminish the daily dose or the size of the field in the\\n      course of treatment.\\n      \\n (5) There exists no fixed method of\\n      treatment, only a simple clinical treatment for each individual patient\\n      and for the special type of tumor..\\n      \\n (6) Improvement in roentgen apparatus\\n      of higher voltages, producing more penetrating rays, will permit a better\\n      relation between destruction of malignant cells and preservation of the\\n      supporting, and the radio sensitivity of the tumor may be prolonged.'\n",
      " 'Tresorie - ALL INDIA HOMOEOPATHIC CONVENTION WELCOME ADDRESS [All India\\nHomoeopathic Convention Welcome Address]\\n\\n Mr. President, Friends and Colleagues.\\n      \\n It fills my heart with joy unspeakable\\n      to extend a hearty welcome to you all to this city at this All India\\n      Homoeopathic Convention held on the occasion of Bi-centennial Birth-day\\n      Anniversary of our great Master Hahnemann. This is the city where\\n      Homoeopathy was first introduced by Rajendra Lal Dutta of hallowed memory,\\n      who spent a princely fortune for dissemination of its principles and\\n      practice among his countrymen. This is the city where took place the\\n      dramatic conversion of one of the then medical luminaries of the first\\n      magnitude, to the practice of Homoeopathy under the influence of Rajendra\\n      Lal. I mean Dr. Mahendra Lal Sircar who became the high priest of\\n      Homoeopathy, spread its glory far and wide and gained thereby an\\n      international reputation for himself. This is the city where the\\n      celebrities of Homoeopathy like Dr. Berigny, Dr. Salzar, Dr. P.C.\\n      Majumdar, Dr. D. N. Roy. Dr. Younan, Dr. J.N. Majumdar, Dr. Baridbaran\\n      Mukherji, Dr. S.K. Nag, Dr. A.N. Mukherji, Dr. T.N. Palit, Dr. G.\\n      Dirghangi and a host of other talented physicians practised their\\n      profession with credit and success and held aloft the banner of\\n      Homoeopathy. This is the city where exist pioneer institutions for the\\n      teaching of Homoeopathy. This is the city wherefrom Homoeopathy has spread\\n      to all parts of India and its votaries are doing yeomans service for the\\n      good of the suffering humanity.\\n      \\n We are meeting this evening on a\\n      historic occasion and we have to arrive at decisions which might make or\\n      mar the future history of Homoeopathy in India. It may be that forces of\\n      disruption, destruction and obstruction are at work; it may be that self\\n      and vested interests seem to thwart the smooth progress of Homoeopathy; it\\n      may be that some may seem to play in the hands of the Powers that are not\\n      too sympathetic to the cause of Homoeopathy; it may be that the present\\n      seems to be chaotic and future of Homoeopathy dubious but great is truth\\n      indeed and will prevail. We should not lose heart or throw up the sponge.\\n      Tradition, authority, sectarianism, dogmatism are great obstacles on the\\n      way. But obstacles and difficulties are meant to be fought out and\\n      overcome. Strifes and dissensions, discords and disunities may hamper our\\n      progress but they are nonetheless signs of lifes activities. It is a good\\n      augury that the Homoeopathic profession is shaking off its age - long\\n      slumber and getting more and more conscious of its duties and obligation,\\n      its rights and privileges and of its short - comings and practical\\n      difficulties. The life of Hahnemann is there to encourage us; the\\n      masterful will of his dynamic spirit is there to inspire us to intensify\\n      our activities; his achievements are there to goad us to realise greater\\n      success; and his personality is always before us to take lessons from, in\\n      our life which as Swami Vivekananda puts it, is \"a process of\\n      unfolding and development of a being under circumstances tending to press\\n      it down.\"\\n      \\n That Homoeopathy is a scientific system\\n      of treatment, philosophically sound, logically unimpeachable, practically\\n      highly efficacious in curing the sick and cheap enough to suit the poor\\n      economic condition of the Indian masses - has become a much talked - of\\n      subject in the country. But why is it not spreading sufficiently and\\n      adequately in our motherland or in fact anywhere in the world? Why is our\\n      National Government not still keen on according official recognition to\\n      this superb system of healing art or providing ways and means for its\\n      development and diffusion? Why the public opinion is not gaining strength\\n      enough to put sufficient pressure on our Government to take interest in\\n      it? Why sufficient number of fully equipped Homoeopathic teaching\\n      institutions and hospitals are not growing to turn out adequate number of\\n      fully qualified Homoeopathic physicians in the country?\\n      \\n It is high time that we should draw the\\n      attention of the profession and the laity to provide answers to so many\\n      \"whys\" and to solve the pressing problems in the matter\\n      concerned. On a cursory view it becomes evident that the Homoeopathic\\n      profession, the people and the Government are each individually and\\n      collectively responsible for this impasse.\\n      \\n The so - called Allopathy still\\n      occupies the dominant place in any country, even in the land of birth of\\n      Homoeopathy. It is no wonder that Homoeopathy, being a discovery of merely\\n      a century and a half still lags behind its rival shool. But it is a wonder\\n      of wonders that Homoeopathy has already encompassed the whole world within\\n      such a short period since it was ushered into existence by Hahnemann.\\n      History of man reveals that nowhere a new truth was accepted by him easily\\n      and readily, obsessed as he is with conservatism, tradition, authority and\\n      vested interests. Nonetheless the triumphant march of Homoeopathy with a\\n      such a meteoric speed throughout the length and breadth of the world is a\\n      proof positive of the truth inherent in the system and phenomenal\\n      therapeutic efficacy of this healing art. It is one more glaring instance\\n      of mans love of truth against heavy odds that impede his progress at every\\n      step.\\n      \\n For the propagation of any new truth\\n      and its acceptance by man, in general, the first and foremost condition is\\n      the turning out of sufficient number of persons who have realised the\\n      truth and are adept in the practice of it. This involves establishment of\\n      a sufficient number of teaching institutions which will turn out experts\\n      in the science and art of Homoeopathy; and a sufficient number of\\n      Homoeopathic Hospital where, the efficacy of this system of treatment will\\n      be put to test.\\n      \\n Human knowledge is becoming\\n      unmanageably vast. The appearance of specialists has become indispensable.\\n      So special Hospitals for the treatment of specific types of diseases have\\n      sprung forth elsewhere, e.g. Tuberculosis Hospitals, Cancer Hospitals,\\n      Hospital for Tropical Diseases etc. Because of organisation of these\\n      hospitals people generally think of getting themselves treated in these\\n      institutions. As there are no fully - equipped general Homoeopathic\\n      Hospitals and not to speak of special Homoeopathic Hospitals and not to\\n      speak of special Homoeopathic Hospitals the result is Homoeopathy is not\\n      getting a fair chance of treating those diseases like tuberculosis,\\n      cancer, acute infectious diseases of epidemic type e.g., Small-pox,\\n      Cholera etc. on a large and organised scale. Consequently the general\\n      public cannot keep much faith in this treatment and mostly take recourse\\n      to homoeopathic treatment when the case is \"past all hope and past\\n      all surgery\". Hence the establishment of fully - equipped\\n      Homoeopathic institutions (College - cum - Hospitals) is an imperative\\n      necessity for enhancing the prestige of the Homoeopathic profession and\\n      for convincing the people about the therapeutic efficacy of this system of\\n      treatment. Is it not a pity that Homoeopathy once established its\\n      reputation by treating Cholera cases in this city and now nobody thinks of\\n      this treatment in Cholera cases and rushes the patient to the Allopathic\\n      Hospitals which are especially meant for these types of patients? How can\\n      we hope to gain ground under these circumstances?\\n      \\n The next great obstacle is the apathy\\n      and in many cases active antagonism of our Government, both at the Centre\\n      and at least in some of the State, towards Homoeopathy. The Government is\\n      under the thumb of its medical directorates which are solely manned by\\n      Allopathic doctors. The main reasons for the non - acceptance of the\\n      Homoeopathic system of treatment may be summed up in three words:\\n      tradition, authority and professionalism. Their psychology is easily\\n      understood if it is borne in mind that the conservative inertia of human\\n      mind attempts to reject any new thought will all the means at its\\n      disposal. Another reason is due to vested interests. Even a cursory glance\\n      at the history of origin and spread of Homoeopathy, enables one to find\\n      out that the opposition to this system from the start, was not scientific\\n      but rather of commercial nature on the part of the apothecaries who were\\n      afraid of losing their trade - profits. We regret to note that the Central\\n      Government have not yet implemented a single recommendation put forward by\\n      the Homoeopathic Enquiry Committee, Planning Commission. Third Health\\n      Ministers Conference, Ad Hoc Committee etc. though Homoeopathic Acts have\\n      been passed in the States of Bombay, U.P., Madhya Pradesh, Travancore -\\n      Cochin, Bihar etc. I is curious to note that W. Bengal is the only State\\n      where a Homoeopathic Bill has recently been thrown out by the State\\n      Government.\\n      \\n Another great obstacle is the\\n      psychology of the general mass of population who fail to adopt a proper\\n      philosophical attitude towards Homoeopathy and takes the Homoeopathic\\n      Therapeutic Law as great paradox contrary to common sense. Unless we can\\n      educate the public in the matter, we cannot hope to secure their whole -\\n      hearted support for this system of treatment.\\n      \\n Lack of enthusiasm for constructive\\n      works on the part of the Homoeopathic profession, the apathy of our\\n      Government and hesitancy on the part of the public to accept Homoeopathy\\n      are great obstacles to the spread of this system of treatment in the\\n      country. Unless this vicious circles is broken the progress of Homoeopathy\\n      is bound to be impeded. We have to fight on all fronts if we aspire to\\n      achieve victory in our battle for the cause of Homoeopathy and the\\n      suffering humanity.\\n      \\n But our first necessity as pointed out\\n      by the Soul of India expressing itself through Sri Aurobindo, is: If India\\n      is to survive and do her appointed work in the world, the youth of India\\n      should learn to think, to think on all subjects, to think independently,\\n      fruitfully, going to the heart of things, not stopped by their surface,\\n      free of pre - judgements, shearing sophism and prejudice asunder as with a\\n      sharp sword smiting down obscurantism of all kinds as with a mace of\\n      Bhima.\\n      \\n \"Let our brains no longer, like\\n      European infants, be swathed with swaddling clothes; let it have recover\\n      the free and unbound motion of the Gods, let it have not only the\\n      minuteness but the wide mastery and sovereignty natural to the intellect\\n      of Bharata and easily recoverable by it if it once accustomes itself to\\n      feel its own power and be convinced of its own worth.\\n      \\n \"The old fixed foundations have\\n      been broken up, we are tossing in the waters of a great upheaval and\\n      change. It is no use clinging to the old ice - floes of the past, they\\n      will soon melt and leave their refugees struggling in perilous waters. It\\n      is no use landing ourselves in the infirm bog, neither sea nor good, dry\\n      land of a second - hand Europeanism. We shall only die there a miserable\\n      and unclean death.\\n      \\n \"No we must learn to swim and use\\n      that power to reach the good vessel of unchanging truth; we must land\\n      again on the eternal rock of ages.\"\\n      \\n Yes, we must expand, we must assimilate\\n      whatever is assimilable for our growth. Stagnation and contraction are the\\n      signs of Death. Our knowledge must be aggressive, must diffuse through the\\n      rank and file of the whole Homoeopathic profession if we wish to survive\\n      and perpetuate ourselves; to leave an extensive ignorance either below or\\n      around us is to expose ourselves to the perpetual danger of being\\n      exterminated as a professional entity.\\n      \\n In fine, I welcome you, once again, on\\n      this historic occasion to this historic city to deliberate, to exchange\\n      view points and to come to agreed decisions with regard to our future line\\n      of action in respect of Homoeopathy in all its aspects.'\n",
      " 'Tresorie - SOME OBSERVATIONS ON NEURASTHENIA AND ITS TREATMENT\\n[Neurasthenia & Treatment]\\n\\n WHEN, thirty-five years ago, the writer\\n      first made the acquaintance of what is now called neurasthenia, it was\\n      known as spinal irritation, and the best of modern researches have been\\n      unable to give a better definition beyond a functional disturbance of the\\n      spinal and cerebral nerves, dependent on a morbid process, for which\\n      \"irritation\" is as proper a term as any. As deaths do not occur,\\n      autopsies throw no light on the subject. Briefly stated, neurasthenia,\\n      when observed from the beginning through its chronic course, has a period\\n      of prodromal symptoms followed by a protracted acute, and succeeded by a\\n      still more protracted chronic, state, between the end of which and the\\n      beginning of convalescence there is a very vague, often indiscernible,\\n      boundary line.\\n      \\n The prodromal symptoms are quite\\n      indefinite and very variable, pointing to nothing in particular. Loss of\\n      appetite, irregular sleep, excitability alternating with lassitude, etc.,\\n      are often overlooked, especially when the second stage-display of unusual\\n      mental and physical energy without subsequent fatigue- becomes apparent.\\n      This is often mistaken for a sign of unusually good health. When a young\\n      girl or mature woman, married or unmarried, feels that she can study ten\\n      hours a day and devote half of her night to pleasure or business; when\\n      besides much mental occupation she begins to rejoice in long walks without\\n      fatigue, that is the time when the mischief is going on without exciting\\n      timely suspicion. Relief is at last sought when the functional disorder of\\n      the nerves has gone to the opposite extreme, and becomes manifest in what\\n      is properly and popularly termed \"nervous prostration,\" when\\n      instead of having no sense of fatigue, the best bodily or mental effort\\n      seems intolerable, in grave cases rendering the patient a helpless being,\\n      completely dependent on the unremitting assistance of others whom she )it\\n      is usually a woman) rules with the inexorable power of the vis inertiae.\\n      \\n During this usually very protracted\\n      period of the disease convalescence usually sets in, but so imperceptibly\\n      that the physician alone can sometimes estimate its progress, which is\\n      unnoticeable to others towards whom the patient acts as she has for months\\n      or years. This is the time for action, too often delayed from motives of\\n      misplaced sympathy on the part of relatives and friends.\\n      \\n The affections is in many instances\\n      limited to the spine, the mind becoming only secondarily tired. In other\\n      cases it is spinal and cerebral; in others again chiefly cerebral. The\\n      line between this and insanity is always clearly definable. Though a\\n      neurasthenic patient may become insane, and probably the reverse, yet both\\n      are distinct conditions.\\n      \\n Books speak of this disease at common\\n      to men and women. Yet in this region in small towns as well as in large\\n      cities the cases of neurasthenia in women are preponderatingly great.\\n      \\n Hypochondriacs and hysteria stand in\\n      peculiar relation to neurasthenia. They maybe regarded as different\\n      species of the same genus; that is, more or less deeply seated\\n      disturbances of the cerebro-spinal system in which the sympathetic system\\n      is probably indirectly involved, as many functional disturbances presided\\n      over by the great sympathetic system often testify. Hypochondriasis, pure\\n      and simple as occurring in men, is easily distinguishable by its striking\\n      characteristic of introspection and despondency, occasioned by abnormal\\n      sensations, without marked physical weakness and tiredness. Pure\\n      hypochondriacs are often energetic, conscientious workers. In hysteria\\n      there is neither great tiredness nor tendency to introspection, but a\\n      paroxysmal or prolonged absence of the power of self control, in grave\\n      cases associated with tonic or clonic muscular spasm and loss of\\n      consciousness. While neurasthenia in its uncomplicated forms is free from\\n      these symptoms, but, as ample experience teaches, often complicated with\\n      both of the preceding forms to such an extent that it is often very\\n      difficult to tell which is primary and which secondary. The symptoms known\\n      as introspection, hysterical aberrations of the emotions, and neurasthenic\\n      sense of exhaustion are in their distinctive manifestations most important\\n      and constitute indications in the selection of remedial and dietetic\\n      measures.\\n      \\n The following are some observation of\\n      peculiarities observed in a large number of cases and peculiar to all:.\\n      \\n Introspection.-The neurasthenic patient\\n      in variably expresses her desire for relief, not so much in a direct\\n      appeal as in a supplicating, subdued tone of voice and manner. She rarely\\n      asks, \"What can you do to relieve me?\" but almost invariably,\\n      \"What is the cause of\" this or that sensation? If she is\\n      introspective, that is, hypochondriacal, she becomes a nosomaniac,\\n      watching acutely every one of her numerous distressing sensation, on the\\n      unremitting analysis of which her mind dwells. In marked cases she is\\n      quite unable to think of anything outside of herself, and in many cases\\n      dislikes to do so, preferring to river her attention on herself. Attempts\\n      to divert her annoy or anger her. Friends and relatives implore the\\n      physician to divert the patient, but all their attempts are in vain\\n      because quite misdirected.\\n      \\n Positive and Negative Will.-It seems\\n      sometimes as if the patient delights in her self-inspection, and that she\\n      prefers her condition to speedy recovery. This is not the case, for the\\n      patient will always assure the physician of her wish to get well. During\\n      the acute stage-a long yet definable period-this wish and longing cannot\\n      well be utilized, but the long and ill-defined period of convalescence\\n      must first be awaited. Here we shall always discover that the wish and the\\n      will of the patient are two very different mental conditions. The desire\\n      or wish for recovery is entirely unattended by any will effort to\\n      accomplish the desired end. The injunctions and directions of the\\n      physician are resisted by the same unconquerable power of negative power,\\n      or vis inertiae. The patient having been unable to exert her will, now\\n      thinks herself unable to use it.\\n      \\n Numerous Symptoms of Patients.-To\\n      physicians in search of indications for medicines each statement of\\n      patient concerning a sensation is apt to be considered as a symptom. Many\\n      years ago, when resolved to get at the keynote of a patient\\'s case, the\\n      writer determined to allow the patient to detail all her symptoms as long\\n      as she chose and to take accurate notes of each one till the right one\\n      should be disclosed; and this was to be done regardless of time and\\n      exertion. The patient, one who needed no urging to describe her\\n      \"symptoms,\" began in an almost inaudible voice, detailing one\\n      sensation after another with an unrivalled degree of clearness and\\n      vividness of expression; as she proceeded the voice became stronger, her\\n      face slightly flushed, and the most perfect descriptive language flowed in\\n      an endless stream. Each word was written down, page after page was filled;\\n      still she went on with unmistakable signs of satisfaction at being able to\\n      pour her pent-up emotions into willing and sympathetic ears. If, for a\\n      moment, the flow of language was interrupted, a simple question would\\n      re-animate her to proceed with renewed energy. Feelings seemed to beget\\n      feelings; their complexity gave the patient no trouble; her intellect was\\n      equal to the action of unraveling the most complicated sensation,\\n      separating them into their component parts and spreading them out before\\n      the mind of the listener. A glance at the watch showed that nearly two\\n      hours had passed, during which the feeblest of neurasthenic patients had\\n      talked incessantly. The note-book was full, the keynote was found. It was\\n      this: neurasthenic patients have innumerable sensation and exhibit no\\n      sings of fatigue after talking incessantly for nearly two hours.\\n      \\n Great Endurance of Neurasthenics.-The\\n      instance just related, which is one of many, illustrates two things. One\\n      is, that it is not the kind of sensation described but the fact that\\n      neurasthenics have innumerable sensations, that constitute the symptoms.\\n      The other thing is that many neurasthenics are capable of great exertion\\n      without suffering disagreeable after- effects from fatigue. This is\\n      illustrated by other cases of which I have notes. A highly neurasthenic\\n      young lady consented to camp out for her health near a lake. She was\\n      induced to join a party for a short walk along the lake. By trying what\\n      they thought a shorter road the party lost their way and took a very long\\n      walk of about four hours, through bogs and over forces. The neurasthenic\\n      was less fatigued than some of the others. The interesting observation was\\n      subsequently made that the patient had become interested in a young man of\\n      the party. She recovered her health within a year from that time. Other\\n      cases of this kind will appear under the head of therapeutic suggestions.\\n      \\n Neurasthenic Patients Crave\\n      Sympathy.-This is one of the most formidable obstacles to the curative\\n      management of such cases, for the kind of sympathy such patients crave is\\n      expressions of condolence and more or less deep affliction at so much\\n      suffering as the patient expresses. Such sympathy is most natural and does\\n      honor to the feelings of parents, sisters, brothers and husbands, but it\\n      is unfortunate that the deeper their expression of affliction so much the\\n      more profound will be the mental dejection and weakness of the patient.\\n      Almost every case which has come under the writer\\'s observation has been\\n      much hampered if not made hopeless by this condition of things, against\\n      which no remedy suggests itself that would not be construed as\\n      \"unkind\".\\n      \\n The origin of this very formidable and\\n      refractory nervous disease, like that of most diseases usually termed\\n      chronic, is either hereditary or acquired, as the histories of every\\n      observed case plainly testify. Either the father was a hypochondriac or\\n      the mother neurasthenic, or both parents were of unsound nervous\\n      constitution. Dipsomania on the part of parents produces neurasthenia in\\n      the children, as readily as it will be followed by any other form of\\n      nervous disease, according to the individual predisposition of the\\n      offspring. The excessive use of tea and coffee is another very active\\n      factor in the history of neurasthenics. Where fathers inclined to alcohol,\\n      mothers are addicted to tea and coffee, which, while its immediate effects\\n      do not obtrude themselves upon our notice, are none the less insidious in\\n      their more remote consequences.\\n      \\n The acquired forms of neurasthenia are\\n      of utmost interest to the therapeutist, and the sources of acquisition are\\n      readily stated. They are much brain-work with insufficient food and sleep.\\n      Such conditions obtain chiefly in women (less frequently in men) of fine\\n      intellectual ability, conscientiousness and ambition. Physical overwork\\n      with unintellectual women has no such effect. Quite analogous to the above\\n      are the conditions of care and sorrow, especially in women who are able\\n      for a long time to conceal and control their emotions. The usual\\n      consequence of such states of mind is disregard of food and insufficient\\n      sleep. Instances of acquired neurasthenia are presented in families of\\n      several girls and boys, where one or more of the former are Neurasthenic\\n      while the latter are vigorous and athletic. Boys delighting in vigorous\\n      exercise do not, as is the case with girls, lose appetite and sleep.\\n      \\n The effects of nervous exhaustion in\\n      boys are usually much less grave than in girls; as a rule such effects are\\n      manifested in mental, not muscular, tiredness, and they are relieved by\\n      air and exercise, while in girls and women those influences are shunned\\n      because they seem to increase the tiredness.\\n      \\n Predisposition-The temperament, or what\\n      in modern pharaseology is called the personal equation, plays a visible\\n      but uncontrollable part in the progress of neurasthenia, as temperament\\n      greatly determines the other imperfectly known condition known as\\n      predisposition. Where the disease is hereditary, it is easy to say that\\n      the predisposition is due to that source; where there is no history of\\n      heredity and where neurasthenia exists in the last members of a\\n      generation, it may be attributed to acquired predisposition which needed\\n      only the exciting cause to establish the disease in its most typical form.\\n      \\n One of the most common forms of\\n      neurasthenia, often quite intractable, results from a serious defect in\\n      our public school system, one which affects chiefly girls from twelve to\\n      fourteen years of age. The following is a brief example: The child rises\\n      late with no appetite for breakfast and no time to eat it if so inclined.\\n      The lessons, however, have been learned the evening before, and the school\\n      work is begun with an ambitions will and a crammed mind, and continues\\n      with one intermission of often not more than ten minutes or three of four\\n      hours. The pupil arrives at home ravenously hungry, eats too fast, and too\\n      much of injudiciously prepared food, too long in digesting to leave room\\n      for an appetite for even a light evening meal, or even for a breakfast the\\n      next morning.\\n      \\n In another case the girl or boy grows\\n      desperately hungry while at school, but being unprovided with food\\n      (lunch), goes on with the school exercises, at the end of which the sense\\n      of hunger has vanished and has been replaced by an aversion to normal\\n      food, with a possible craving for something pungent and indigestible. This\\n      observation can easily be made in many instances, and will, in as many\\n      cases, be seen to lead to nervous prostration, which is then treated by\\n      vile, patented concoctions consisting largely of whiskey, under the name\\n      of \"tonics,\" while the patient needs only the best that a\\n      legitimate market affords prepared in a sensible manner.\\n      \\n Typical Cases Ending in Rapid\\n      Recovery.-Curative results have already been indicated in what has been\\n      said above, and further indications for treatment may be gathered from a\\n      few cases of extremely rapid recovery of apparently incurable cases, to\\n      which brief allusion will here be made. A woman of forty had been a victim\\n      of grave neurasthenia for five years. In the absence of an inclination to\\n      exert himself, she had, during that period, been mostly confined to her\\n      bed or lounge, in the meantime giving birth to two children, going through\\n      gestation and confinement normally, without recovering from neurasthenic\\n      prostration which, in the course of some years more, rendered her entirely\\n      helpless. Her condition was associated with a feeling of dropping to\\n      pieces unless supported and braced by a harness of wood, iron and leather,\\n      in which she \"sat up\" for several hours each day, spending the\\n      rest of the time in bed. Having left the patient in this condition, it was\\n      reported before the writer\\'s next professional visit that Mrs.-had been\\n      cured, and that she was able to go out like other people. A visit to the\\n      house confirmed the report. The patient came to the door herself, and in a\\n      quiet manner, entirely without the least expression of joy or wonder at\\n      her release, stated, that having heard of a famous \"magnetic\\n      physician,\" she summoned him, was ordered by him to arise and stand;\\n      protesting that it was impossible, she was raised to her feet and again\\n      ordered to stand, then to walk. Fearing that she would fall, she begged\\n      the magnetic doctor to support her, which he peremptorily refused, saying\\n      she might fall if she liked. Instead of falling, she had to walk about the\\n      room, was then placed upon a lounge and subjected to a severe treatment of\\n      rolling and pummelling, and then ordered to dress and sit up until tired,\\n      to remain up and about like other people, and to call on the doctor in\\n      future, as he would not come so far to the patient again. This happened\\n      about twenty-five years ago, and the patient has been in very fair health\\n      arrested by insisting that all professional visits by the writer or any\\n      other physician to whose sympathy the patient could appeal must cease.\\n      This injunction was carried out conscientiously with the best results by\\n      the husband of the patient. Perhaps we may learn from this that sometimes,\\n      at least, the familiar motto is reversed, and angels rush in where fools\\n      fear to tread.\\n      \\n Profiting by this experience, another\\n      neurasthenic woman, unmarried, but of most intractable, antagonistic\\n      temperament, confined to her bed, in and out of hospitals, for years,\\n      wearing out the strength and means of her relatives and the patience of\\n      many physicians, was at length abandoned by them. It was a case of spinal\\n      and cerebral neurasthenia complicated with hypochondriasis in its most\\n      trying form of introspective maunderings and endless description of\\n      symptoms. She tormented her advisers by her endless tirades, the\\n      indulgence of which invariably aggravated her condition, and were there\\n      fore avoided, until once her physician yielded to the patient\\'s\\n      importunities for a visit, when be found her in her usual abject state of\\n      prostration. Guided by experience derived from cases like the one first\\n      described, he assisted the patient to her feet and marched her, will you\\n      nil you, up and down the room until he, at least, was thoroughly tired,\\n      and then departed with the promise never to do so again. The patient, on\\n      her part, made a number of her unnameable promises, but kept on her feet\\n      and let the doctors alone. Though not cured of deeply-rooted morbid mental\\n      faults, the neurasthenic phase of her condition had yielded to the change\\n      of the antagonistic element of her character from passive to very\\n      practical activity. A third very serious case of this kind occurred in the\\n      person of a girl of fifteen, of selfish character, who gradually became\\n      bed-ridden with spinal and cerebral neurasthenia, and tormented with the\\n      usual multifarious painful sensations, none of which, on the most\\n      pains-taking physical examination, resulted from demonstrable organic\\n      disease of genital or abdominal organs. The patient was most tenderly\\n      cared for by her mother, who, in the course of years, became so imbued\\n      with the idea of yielding to every wish and whim of the patient, that at\\n      length remonstrance became useless. The mother, though recognizing the\\n      importance of persuading or urging her daughter to depend more on herself,\\n      admitted that she had yielded so long that now she must continue to feed,\\n      dress and assist her charge in the most trivial things. Her food had to be\\n      placed in her mouth, the position of a hand or foot changed by some one\\n      else, although patient did so spontaneously when she chose. This went on\\n      for fifteen years, when the mother, growing old and feeble, died. Her\\n      maternal support being gone, the patient at once proved her ability to\\n      walk, to dress, to feed herself, and to seek light employment. Though far\\n      from well, she is equally far fro being a helpless, bed-ridden invalid.\\n      \\n A fourth case, still very vividly\\n      impressed on the writer\\'s mind, was one of a healthy, romping girl of 14,\\n      who, as happen in this remarkably capricious disease, in the midst of\\n      perfect health, one day took to her bed and remained there with all the\\n      symptoms of neurasthenia, involving first the spinal and finally the\\n      cerebral nerves. This patient was very amiable, conscientious, and\\n      sensible, never loquacious, and not troubled with hypochondriacal thoughts\\n      or sensations. Tiredness was the only expression she used in describing\\n      her feelings. There was literally no variation from this condition, which\\n      confined her to her bed for years, till she grew from a girl to a woman.\\n      Eating and sleeping well, and improving perceptibly in personal appearance\\n      and character, yet she lay on her couch tired and watched over with\\n      unremitting care by a most anxious mother, showing her solicitude and\\n      sympathy in every feature. Once, in the second year of the disease, a\\n      favorable interruption occurred. The mother, still a young woman, gave\\n      birth to another child. During her confinement the neurasthenic patient\\n      was in charge of her mother\\'s nurse, assisted by other servants. The\\n      nurse, while devoted to the daughter, agreed with the writer that excess\\n      of sympathy was injurious, and used her best and judicious endeavors\\n      gradually to persuade the patient to make some physical effort at walking\\n      and standing. In this she was so successful that in two weeks she\\n      accompanied the girl on half-mile walks up and down hill, finally without\\n      assistance. Thus, recovery seemed assured, and everything was favorable\\n      progressing towards it when the mother, having fully recovered, again took\\n      charge of her daughter, with the result that she at once took to her\\n      lounge and remained there two years longer. About that time other advice\\n      was urged and gladly acceded to, with the result that the case was\\n      diagnosed by an eminent surgeon as spinal paralysis in consequence of\\n      concussion, though it could never be shown when and where it occurred.\\n      Salves, plasters, anodynes, nervines, and electricity did no good, but\\n      effectually destroyed appetite and digestion, which higher to had been\\n      normal. So this adviser resigned in favor of a third, who, being a younger\\n      and less prejudiced man, agreed perfectly with the writer\\'s original\\n      opinion. He advised return to moderate exercise, avoidance of drugs, and\\n      less display of sympathy. This, though formerly rejected as\\n      \"unkind,\" was now acceded to as coming from a nerve- specialist,\\n      fresh from Europe, at that time very rare. Still attending the other\\n      members of the family, the writer had sample opportunity of observing the\\n      course of the case. Improvement was very slow and uncertain till financial\\n      misfortune overtook the family. Almost with a bound our patient left her\\n      cough, and, organizing a kindergarten, strove energetically in supporting\\n      herself and assisting her mother. The change came about in less than three\\n      weeks, and resulted in perfect recovery.\\n      \\n At this point another very instructive\\n      case of very speedy recovery, after six or seven years of neurasthenic\\n      prostration, deserves to be mentioned. A woman of 35 had been in bed and\\n      on the lounge most of the time for nearly seven years, at the end of which\\n      time she became my patient, her regular medical attendant having gone to\\n      Europe. She was of very amiable disposition and as sensitive as she was\\n      weak. Her symptoms, as in the other cases, were instantaneous exhaustion\\n      on the least physical exertion. She could give herself up to no mental\\n      occupation beyond directing her house-hold affairs, the education of her\\n      son, and the rehearsal of her numerous sensations. She had not been my\\n      patient long when her husband failed in business, so that the family was\\n      reduced from very comfortable circumstances to a condition which made it\\n      necessary for the patient to make her own living and that of the family.\\n      This she almost at once proceeded to do, setting aside all other\\n      considerations and establishing a boarding-house, where she did most of\\n      the work herself. This she has done now for ten or twelve years without a\\n      serious relapse. The time involved in the period of convalescence was\\n      scarcely more than three weeks, a although her work maybe said to have\\n      begun at the moment her resolution was taken.\\n      \\n Prognostics.-From these and other cases\\n      in and outside of the writer\\'s practice, it is safe to say that the\\n      majority of cases of neurasthenia recover, though years may elapse before\\n      that period. We learn, furthermore, that recoveries, especially of very\\n      inveterate cases, depend on conditions beyond the control of the\\n      physician, as was the case in the above-recorded instances, where\\n      circumstances forced the patient to cases to wish for recovery and to make\\n      an effort of the will. This having been once accomplished self-confidence,\\n      for a long time in abeyance, was permanently restored.\\n      \\n Curability, further, depends very much\\n      on the temperament of the patient, whether amiable, tractable and\\n      confiding in the honest endeavors of the physician, or whether refractory,\\n      suspicious, untruthful, selfish and antagonistic, of a disposition\\n      impossible to win over on account of unnatural distrust of every\\n      well-meaning person. The degree of intelligence of patients also has a\\n      pronounced influence on the result. The most readily curable cases are\\n      those acquired without hereditary predisposition, where the cause is found\\n      in the absence of food and sleep, also where sorrow and anxiety can be\\n      averted or counteracted by judicious conduct of near relatives and\\n      friends.\\n      \\n Dietetic Treatment.-This, as medicinal\\n      treatment, must be governed by the stage at which the case comes into the\\n      physician\\'s hands-whether yet in its prodromal, its acute or its chronic\\n      phase. The prodromal stage of the disease has no very decided\\n      pathognomonic signs. The most that can be recognized in this stage is that\\n      the patient\\'s habits or duties are of a kind which will eventually lead to\\n      obdurate neurasthenia if not arrested in time by removing the exciting\\n      causes. Too much pleasure, as well as too much care, especially in girls\\n      and woman, tends to neglect of food and rest, in the absence of which,\\n      excitements, whether of pleasure or care, begets a state of unrest in\\n      which repose is disagreeable. With such a condition comes a list of\\n      incipient casual complaints of headache, imperfect sleep, notional ways of\\n      eating, working or playing. A few questions will determine whether the\\n      patient is living according to normal or abnormal habits with regard to\\n      appetite, sleep and occupation. Where these are found, their alteration to\\n      normal ways must be instead on. It is unnecessary to say that this is\\n      easier said than done, for it will probably meet with serious objections\\n      on the part of the patient, if not on that of her relatives; for most\\n      likely she has examinations for college to prepare for, involving several\\n      months of dose and careful study at night, and the patient cannot waste\\n      time in sleeping and eating while cramming that little excited and\\n      ambitions brain. A failure in the examinations would be as much of a\\n      disappointment to parents as to patient, who proves, as usual, that this\\n      appellation is a misnomer. She accordingly goes in as she please, lied by\\n      an increasing morbidly ambitions impulse, and the result is likely to be\\n      the mournful satisfaction on the part of the physician of being obliged to\\n      say, \"I told you before what would happen.\" Of course, all\\n      regret the now evident nerve-prostration, while, if the doctor had\\n      succeeded in enforcing his rules, he would in many cases experience the\\n      still more painful reproach of having been too severe. Nevertheless,\\n      absolute firmness and a kindly but unflinching exertion of his will,\\n      without the least compromise, reward the physician with the best results\\n      in such cases.\\n      \\n When the case, after the stage of\\n      excitement and untiring restlessness (at which it would still be speedily\\n      curable by simple dietetic rules) has, after weeks or months, entered upon\\n      the phase of painful prostration, here we encounter backache, oppressive\\n      headache, and absolute loss of mental or bodily endurance, measures of\\n      dietetic management are much less effective and much more difficult to\\n      find. it is at this stage that slight rise of temperature will occur,\\n      especially towards evening; then the backache and headache disappear, the\\n      pallor is replaced by a flush of color, the eyes lose their listless look,\\n      and the patient is inclined to enter upon some diversion or excitement,\\n      followed by a restless night and a morning of exhaustion and a renewal of\\n      all painful sensations. Most of such patients feel much better in the\\n      evening when they are ready for some entertainment, while in a normal\\n      state this would be the time for relaxation and repose.\\n      \\n The dietetic treatment of this stage is\\n      methodical rest. In severe cases the patient will do well to remain in bed\\n      for several days or even for weeks. It is well to shorten this period as\\n      much as possible and to insist on walking about, or, at least. sitting for\\n      a specified time every day. This may be varied b equally specified periods\\n      of rest in the recumbent position.\\n      \\n Irregularities of eating are at this\\n      and at all times to be superseded by the most rigid regularity of meals.\\n      The traditional and conventional three-meal system, however well adapted\\n      to the needs of a vigorous man or woman, does not agree with the\\n      neurasthenic patient. It is much better that these should eat oftener;\\n      four times a day is best in most cases, for the simple reason that in this\\n      way a patient, while eating less at a time, consumes more food in the\\n      aggregate.\\n      \\n As neurasthenic patients are rarely\\n      troubled with absolute aversion to wholesome food, they are generally able\\n      to consume a liberal quantity, about which it is only needful to remark\\n      here that the food should be selected from among the articles and dishes\\n      which the patient likes, provided they belong to the order of good, normal\\n      articles of food, to the exclusion of those which simply please the taste\\n      without being digestible. A dish entirely of meat or \"animal\\n      food\" is as far from being a good diet for neurasthenics as one\\n      consisting entirely of \"vegetable\" food. As a rule, the diet\\n      list should comprise one-third of nitrogenous material and two-thirds of\\n      carbohydrates. Together with these, it is a great mistake to neglect the\\n      fats, such as good butter and the fats of meats. And, lastly, every\\n      patient of this kind should be made to drink some water often, a dietetic\\n      feature too often neglected.\\n      \\n During this stage, actually fatiguing\\n      exercise of body and mind should be avoided, while, on the other hand, the\\n      patient\\'s mind should be directed away from herself, in which she is much\\n      assisted by withholding a certain kind of emotional sympathy, quite as\\n      natural as it is difficult to repress on the part of affectionate persons.\\n      Of this, a few words further on.\\n      \\n There is no definite time for the\\n      duration of this stage, which, however, depends largely on the time during\\n      which the exciting causes have acted, either aided by or without a\\n      predisposition. It is certain, however, that the sooner it is recognized\\n      and the exciting causes eliminated, so much the sooner recovery will\\n      begin. But there is a stage at which the best of experience and judgment\\n      often fail, especially in very inveterate cases. If the case is one of a\\n      patient whom the physician has had opportunity of watching at least since\\n      the earlier stages, the difficulty is not so great as it is in old cases\\n      months or even of several years\\' duration which come to treatment late. In\\n      these, the line between the intermediate stage and incipient convalescence\\n      cannot be drawn. The patient is as neurasthenic and hypochondriacal as\\n      ever; cannot bear the slightest mental or bodily exertion, not even a word\\n      or a look, without sings of apparent exhaustion, while nearly the whole\\n      time is spent in bed under anxious care of sympathetic attendants. In such\\n      cases, having become assured, by careful physical examination, of the\\n      absence of organic disease, seeing the patient generally well nourished\\n      and in fair muscular condition, the physician is warranted in assuming\\n      that the disease has run its course, that whatever morbid (pathological)\\n      process there may have been progressing in the nervous system, this\\n      process has now come to and end, but it has left the patient\\'s mental\\n      condition habituated to the moods of the past months or years, and fixed,\\n      as it were, indelibly in the memory. It is the habit that now remains, not\\n      the disease.\\n      \\n If reasonably sure of this, and calling\\n      to mind the rapid recoveries and the circumstances attending them, as\\n      above detailed, the physician is now safe in ordering a more energetic\\n      treatment, calculated to rouse the self-reliance of the patient. All\\n      visible signs of sympathy must now be set aside; the actins and demeanor\\n      of the attendants should, from this time, if not before, be changed so as\\n      to give the patient the impression that she is no longer an invalid, but\\n      expected to rely on her own exertion. Instead of being fed, the food\\n      should be placed where she must go for and eat it. She should now be\\n      expected to dress and attend, without assistance, to her natural wants.\\n      This, with some temperaments, is almost impossible, with al extremely\\n      difficult. The best course to pursue is to remove such patients from\\n      sympathetic relatives or friends, and to place them in charge of kind,\\n      reliable, but eminently practical nurses.\\n      \\n The first effect of this is either to\\n      throw the patient into a stage of helpless despondency, which, again\\n      appealing powerfully to the sympathies of those nearest to her, often\\n      frustrates the physician\\'s plans which, if firmly but kindly adhered to,\\n      would, ere long, prove of their superiority by signs of returning\\n      self-reliance and absence of complaints on the part of the patient. A\\n      second form of effect is that occurring in patients of obstreperous,\\n      selfish disposition, whose opposition and even anger is aroused by being\\n      thrown on their own resources after the removal of depressing and\\n      unpractical sympathy. This opposition or temper, often manifested in all\\n      sorts of intrigues and subterfuges on the part of the patient, if not\\n      supinely yielded to by sympathetic persons, will finally be replaced by a\\n      more rational disposition. On the whole, anger or active opposition are\\n      signs of returning energy, which, once coming to the consciousness of the\\n      patient, takes the form of self- reliance. it is this way that the cures\\n      of chronic cases above related can be explained, and physicians should\\n      profit by such experience for the benefit of their patients.\\n      \\n The general dietetic management now\\n      readily follows from what has been said, and needs only a few general\\n      modifications. The first duty of the physician will be to test the degree\\n      of reliance to be placed on the patient and her friends, ad to win them\\n      over if possible to his plans, and his success will be in proportion to\\n      the degree of confidence he is able to inspire. This personal confidence\\n      should not degenerate into a mere personal liking or attachment of a\\n      sympathy-craving neurasthenic who should discover henceforth that all\\n      sentimental expressing of sympathy are about to take a practical form,\\n      aiming at a definite result-the patient\\'s health-which she wishes but\\n      cannot exert her will to attain. The best and often the only way to do\\n      away with sentiment and to reach practical kindness is to remove the\\n      patient from certain home influence, and to place her in a hospital or\\n      elsewhere under the management of competent nurses who, without being\\n      selfish, know how to exert a certain amount of wholesome push as fast as\\n      the patient can bear it. Without the removal of sentimental sympathy, all\\n      efforts at counteracting the purely hypochondriacal side of neurasthenia\\n      are useless.\\n      \\n In these cases of neurasthenia as yet\\n      uncomplicated with the hypochondriacal element of introspective nosomania,\\n      there is only one unconditional rule to be followed, especially in\\n      acquired cases whose evident cause was incessant, conscientious work of\\n      mind and body, together with insufficient food and sleep. Such cases come\\n      on very insidiously, the loss of strength-that is, the actual waste of\\n      nerve-substance-being just a trifle grater than the quantity restored, the\\n      patient unconsciously using up a minute part of her capital every day.\\n      Here the rule should be to reverse matters to insuring a supply of\\n      nourishment and time for its assimilation greater than was the case\\n      heretofore. The case of young school-girls belong in this class. The time\\n      of food and rest should be carefully controlled at home, the duty of the\\n      physician being to educate indifferent and ignorant parents up to an\\n      appreciation of the nature of the case. It is generally not difficult to\\n      open their eyes through the medium of their anxiety concerning their\\n      children\\'s health. Having thus insured sufficient rest and food at home,\\n      the physician\\'s next object of attention should be the regulations of the\\n      school. Here is the point where teachers have an opportunity of exerting\\n      their most practical influence. It should be made obligatory on the part\\n      of teachers to institute inquiry as to whether pupils have had their meals\\n      before coming to school. This they could often ascertain without a\\n      question, by reading the pupil\\'s condition in her emaciated form, pale\\n      face and nervous manner. To guard against neglect at home, it would be an\\n      easy matter to insist that all pupils of public and private schools should\\n      bring with them some proper food. The few who do so generally bring\\n      sweets-an apple, orange or a few dry crackers-when a piece of good bread\\n      and slice of cold meat would be what they actually need. All pupils should\\n      pass inspection, and if remiss in this important particular, the\\n      delinquent should be dismissed with several marks against her. To expect\\n      this of teachers would be a great advance in the place of futile\\n      innovations of endeavoring to send forth from our common schools graduates\\n      in arts and sciences.\\n      \\n Sudden Effects.-A large number of cases\\n      of neurasthenia, especially those complicated with inveterate\\n      Hypochondriasis, are frequently traced to some sudden occurrence, having\\n      the effect of a mental or physical shock. In one patient, a vigorous girl,\\n      used to romping, climbing and running lie a boy, the cause was supposed to\\n      be a slight thump she received during a game of blindman\\'s-buff. She\\n      thought nothing of it at the time, but it was suggested long after the\\n      patient\\'s illness began. In another case some mental shock of joy or\\n      grief, not very severe and such as is often experienced in every person\\'s\\n      life, is the beginning of months of nervous prostration.\\n      \\n There is quite an array of evidence\\n      that neurasthenia which has entered upon a hypochondriacal stage or\\n      complication with or without a strong hysterical admixture, is curable by\\n      sudden impressions in the form of a shock, or more gradually by frequent\\n      repetitions of an impression. Such cases, as I have shown above, occur\\n      most commonly in the stage when what may be considered the essential\\n      pathological disturbances of function have run their course and have left\\n      the patient in a state of mental disturbance which indicated that the\\n      patient\\'s recovery depends entirely upon her volition. But there is none,\\n      and so far nothing has succeeded in arousing it. Persuasion is as useless\\n      and irritating, as argument would be in a case of insanity with a fixed\\n      illusion. The resemblance between this and the state of mind of a\\n      hypochondriacal neurasthenic is very close. She cannot move nor thick.\\n      Exhaustion overcomes her and keeps her its victim for years, when suddenly\\n      the scene changes, and a few days or weeks suffice to restore the patient\\n      to activity. In one instance it is attributed to medical, in another to\\n      \"mind cure,\" in a third to \"Christian science;\" in\\n      still other cases massage has done it, in others again \"magnetic\\n      influence,\" in others the very powerful factor necessity. It is\\n      certain that cases of this kind, produced by sudden effects on the mind of\\n      a predisposed person, are also cured by such effects. Whatever the visible\\n      form of these effects may be -whether that of \"Christian\\n      science,\" joy, grief or absolute inexorable necessity, there is\\n      always to be noticed a certain force and condition involving the modern\\n      idea of suggestion, which comes to the patient in an irresistible degree\\n      and now sets the function of the will in motion again.\\n      \\n Experience teaches that it is by no\\n      means a matter of indifference which of these forms of effect are brought\\n      into action. In one case it is the professional Christian scientist\\'s\\n      method, in another the almost brutal exertion of a person\\'s will combined\\n      with some physical force. In either case the patient is aroused from his\\n      inertia, and discovers his powers of mental and bodily ability to act.\\n      \\n A deplorable result is that recoveries\\n      after such effects are attributed in the popular mind to supernatural\\n      causes. That such is not the case may be gathered form instances occurring\\n      in very sensible and intelligent patients, whose reason is scarcely ever\\n      so far disturbed and weakened that they do not resent the proposition of\\n      trying, e.g., Christian science or mind cure.\\n      \\n Nevertheless, it is the mind cure which\\n      the intelligent patient needs quite as much as the ignorant and\\n      superstitious person; the difference is only the form in which the\\n      influencing force is applied. While in one case it is obedience to the\\n      candidly expressed instructions of the physician, in the other case the\\n      result is the to mystification. In either case it is the powerful stimulus\\n      of hope and aroused confidence that recovery will be realized.\\n      \\n The definition of suggestion does not\\n      fully cover the meaning, because the influence employed is greater than\\n      mere suggestion. The physician\\'s plan of action should be straightforward\\n      assurance of recovery, a direct appeal to hope, and an unceasing endeavor\\n      to arouse the self-reliance of the patient, not so much by verbal\\n      exhortations as by a manner and department from which the patient learns\\n      more readily than from words what is expected. If the attitude of the\\n      physician is appreciated, and seconded by the relatives and attendants, a\\n      favorable result is much more certain to follow.\\n      \\n Hypnotism is not advisable. There are\\n      now existing ancient neurasthenic invalids dating from the times of\\n      spiritualism when they were famous \"mediums.\" Hypnotism weakness\\n      the will and nervous endurance, and produces a predisposition to emotional\\n      nervousness with an intractable erotic admixture. The suggestions sought\\n      to be instilled into a hypnotized patient amount to nothing. The mental\\n      influence of mystical treatment administered while the patients is awake\\n      is much more powerful in awaking hope and confidence than the uncertain\\n      effects of an abnormal state like that of hypnotism. Mystification, again,\\n      though sometimes unavoidable with the best intention, is less powerful\\n      than direct and intelligible encouragement. While resort to mystification\\n      should be shunned by reputable physicians, the question arises as to what\\n      shall be done with the many who, from lack of intelligence or education,\\n      are entirely beyond the reach of honest common sense, and who will persist\\n      in mystifying themselves, who remain neurasthenic invalids in spite of the\\n      best regulations of the physician, and who do not recover unless their\\n      encouragement follows some mystical formalities which alone arouse their\\n      \"faith\" and finally their confidence and will-power. For the\\n      present there is no way out of the dilemma but to submit such patients to\\n      the suggestive methods of what is popularly known as mind cure and\\n      Christian science. In doing so, physicians should use their influence as\\n      far as possible in selecting the most honest persons of this class.\\n      \\n DISCUSSION.\\n      \\n JAMES C. WOOD, M.D.: I have nothing but\\n      words of praise for Dr. Wesselhoeft\\'s excellent paper. It is very evident\\n      that the author\\'s inspiration came not from books but from actual contact\\n      with neurasthenic subjects, for the impress of originality is most\\n      conspicuous. It is a production which could only come from one of\\n      experience and from a reasoner. I consider it a most valuable contribution\\n      to the literature of that now most interesting subject,\\n      \"neurasthenia\".\\n      \\n The doctor, in his paper, has sometimes\\n      used the term \"neurasthenia\" instead of\\n      \"neurasthenia.\" The first of these means, according to Thomas,\\n      great nervous power or excitement; the second, nervous debility. I taken\\n      it from the context that the subject dealt with is neurasthenia. To the\\n      average mind there exists what seems to me a needless confusion regarding\\n      the terms, nervous prostration, hysteria and hystero-neurosis. As I\\n      understand these terms they define distinct conditions, though there is a\\n      frequent blending the one with the other. The term nervous prostration,\\n      which is a synonym of neurasthenia, defines itself; the term hysteria\\n      should be restricted to those general neuroses characterized particularly\\n      by psychical manifestations, though not infrequently by motor, sensory,\\n      secretory, vasomotor and reflex derangements as well; while the term\\n      hysteroneurosis implies the uterine origin of symptoms manifesting\\n      themselves in organs remote from the uterus without structural changes in\\n      such organs, being the direct result of reflex nervous influence starting\\n      from the uterus. The last term does not occur in the paper under\\n      discussion. From the standpoint of a gynecologist I think that this is\\n      misleading.\\n      \\n Let us see why and how it is that these\\n      three conditions (I will not call them diseases) are so frequently\\n      associated. I think that all will admit the frequent occurrence in woman\\n      of reflex symptoms, the result of pelvic lesions. An irritation staring\\n      form the pelvis is conveyed to the genito-spinal centre, thence to any or\\n      all organs with which this centre communicates. The organ oftener involved\\n      than any other is the stomach. This is shown by the frequent occurrence of\\n      nausea and vomiting following conception. The nervous system may have been\\n      previously involved, but oftener it becomes so only after the nutrition is\\n      depraved, which, sooner or later, occurs if the pelvic lesion is not\\n      removed. The depraved blood fails to supply the nerve centres with that\\n      which they need to sustain them, and they become anaemic. Prostration is\\n      but a subjective manifestation of the anaemia, and it varies in degree\\n      from a slight indisposition to the most abject helplessness.\\n      \\n If, then, nervous prostration may have\\n      its beginning in a pelvic lesion, is it possible for a pelvic lesion to be\\n      inaugurated by systemic disturbances? Personally, I believe that it is,\\n      and offer this explanation as the modus operandi by which such a lesion is\\n      induced: Marked circulatory changes nearly always attend nervous\\n      prostration. The circulation is presided over by the vaso-motor system,\\n      and wear and repair depend upon the proper regulation of this system. If\\n      it becomes disturbed, the bloodvessels dilate or contract unduly, with\\n      resulting local hyperaemia or local anaemia, as the case maybe. The\\n      climacteric flushes are the result of such disturbance. The alternate\\n      coldness and heat of the extremities, so often associated with rectal and\\n      uterine lesions, is another familiar illustration. If the brain is\\n      involved, either insomnia or drowsiness occur, depending upon whether the\\n      brain is anaemic or hyperaemic. Flatulence, gastralgia, and nervous\\n      dyspepsia result when the stomach is similarly affected. The womb and the\\n      ovaries, because of the periodical congestion imposed upon them, are\\n      oftener implicated by these unnatural circulatory disturbances than any of\\n      the pelvic organs, and in time also become unduly hyperaemic or anaemic,\\n      as the case may be.\\n      \\n It will thus be seen that nervous\\n      prostration may exist independently of pelvic lesions, or, conversely,\\n      pelvic lesions may exist independently of nervous prostration.\\n      Nevertheless, the two are frequently associated, and this fact ought, I\\n      believe, to be kept in mind in dealing with the affection known as\\n      neurasthenia. Hysterical manifestations nearly always come to the surface\\n      in nervous prostration, and they also frequently attend pelvic lesions.\\n      Indeed, the term \"hystero-psychosis\" has been coined for the\\n      purpose of defining certain psychical disturbances of presumably pelvic\\n      origin, and in the broadest sense neurasthenia is not uncommonly an\\n      hysteroneurosis. It is the frequent association of these three conditions\\n      which, it seems to me, makes it more practicable to study them conjointly.\\n      \\n The special symptoms of nervous\\n      prostration are most variable. Introspection, as Dr. Wesselhoeft has\\n      pointed out, makes of the patient a nosomaniac. The anaemic nerve centres\\n      are unduly impressionable, and a mental shock which would not seriously\\n      affect a stronger and more rugged woman falls with crushing force upon one\\n      whose nutrition is already depraved. In this way are developed disorders\\n      of sensibility, alternations of mobility, circulatory disturbances,\\n      anomalies of secretion and exertion, disorders of the gastro-intestinal\\n      canal, dermatoses, and general and psychical disturbances of all kinds.\\n      Many of these affections start from pelvic lesions, and are nearly always\\n      associated with depravity of nutrition and more or less nervous\\n      prostration.\\n      \\n Some of the worst symptoms of\\n      neurasthenia with which I have had to contend have been hyperaesthesia of\\n      the articulations, giving rise to the so-called \"hysterical\\n      joint.\" Here the prostration is usually not profound, and it is\\n      possible to apply the somewhat energetic treatment recommended by Dr.\\n      Wesselhoeft. I remember one case very distinctly, the detailed history of\\n      which I shall give in another place, which brought me much reputation\\n      because of the \"remarkable\" cure I was fortunate enough to make.\\n      \\n The patient, a beautiful girl of\\n      eighteen, had been bed- ridden for three years with supposed hip-joint\\n      disease. She was in college before assuming the ride of an invalid, and\\n      worried much over her studies and work. She sustained a fall a short time\\n      previously to taking to her bed, and to this fall the injury to the hip\\n      was attributed. She had been from physician to physician and from\\n      sanitarium to sanitarium without receiving benefit. All of the numerous\\n      medical men under whose care she had been, directed their attention to the\\n      hip and applied the classical treatment for morbus coxarius without avail.\\n      The patient had finally reached a point where introspection was her chief\\n      occupation and her mind dwelt almost continually upon a \"diseased\\n      hip.\" She was finally brought to me, coming in an invalid\\'s chair and\\n      looking the very picture of dependency. There was a slight degree of\\n      anaemia, though this was not marked. Notwithstanding the expression\\n      expression of abjectness the girl did not look seriously ill. The hip was\\n      excessively tender upon pressure, but there was no local increase of\\n      temperature, no evidences of fever and suppuration, and forcible\\n      apposition by striking the heel was not very painful. More less spastic\\n      contraction of the flexor muscles of the affected side existed, which gave\\n      to the limb an appearance of actual shortening, which was very deceptive.\\n      Hysterical symptoms were common. On examination I found the left ovary\\n      exquisitely tender. Compression of the ovary increased the pain in the hip\\n      most decidedly and gave rise to much nervous agitation. I did not,\\n      therefore, deem it wise to recommend local treatment other than the daily\\n      use of the hot douche. She had long been a victim of ovarian\\n      dysmenorrhoea. I placed upon the ankle of the affected limb three pounds\\n      of bar-lead, prescribed a pair of crutches and insisted upon her walking.\\n      The lead was used to overcome the spastic contraction as well as for its\\n      moral effect. I did not deem the joint lesion of such a character as to\\n      used extension. In two months\\' time this patient discarded her crutches\\n      for a cane. Six weeks later she put up the cane and is now perfectly well.\\n      \\n This was a case in which somewhat harsh\\n      measures were eminently appropriate.\\n      \\n In marked contrast to the case just\\n      recorded is the following: Mrs.-, aet. 47, widow for twenty years. She is\\n      a devoted church-woman, and for years was a leader in all charitable work\\n      done in the community in which she resided. Through friends she was urged\\n      to consult me, and I think that the call to the neighboring town in which\\n      she lived was countermanded at least four or five times before the finally\\n      mustered up courage and strength enough to see me. Upon reaching the\\n      bedside I found my patient in a room made dark by closed blinds, over\\n      which were hung heavy blankets to shut out every ray of light. The mirror\\n      was turned toward the wall for fear a ray of light might strike it and\\n      flesh throughout the darkened room. Nor did the patient rest under these\\n      extreme precautions, for the eyes were protected with two pairs of colored\\n      glasses with side attachments. Hyperaesthesia of the sense of hearing was\\n      equally marked and the noise was excluded from the room by double doors\\n      whose keyholes were stuffed with cotton. She l so had her ears filled with\\n      cotton, over which she wore ear-mufflers. She was emaciated to an extreme\\n      degree, and had been reduced to her miserable condition by a series of\\n      events which frequently precede profound neurasthenia. Her husband was\\n      killed during the war, and she was left childless. Twelve months previous\\n      to taking to her bed she nursed her mother through a long and fatal\\n      illness. This greatly prostrated her, yet she kept up until a favorite\\n      brother-in-law was thrown from a carriage and killed. This was the last\\n      straw, and the shock compelled her to take to her bed. In due time loss of\\n      appetite with irritability of the stomach developed, which, of course, led\\n      to marked depravity of nutrition. With the anaemia came hyperaesthesia of\\n      the special senses, spinal irritation, headache, hysterical\\n      manifestations, etc. There was no series pelvic lesion, although she had\\n      been much treated for an alleged uterine displacement with congestion.\\n      Unfortunately, she was encouraged, instead of discouraged, in her\\n      invalidism, and she soon became a nosomaniac of the worst type. She had\\n      written down her symptoms one at a time, and the record is such a typical\\n      one that I should like to give it in full, but time forbids.\\n      \\n With great difficulty the patient was\\n      moved on a cough to a private hospital and placed under the Weir Mitchell\\n      treatment. I ignored the pelvic trouble entirely. It is unnecessary to\\n      give in detail the progress of the case from day to day after this\\n      treatment was inaugurated. Suffice it to say that the improvement was of\\n      the most marked character, and in six weeks from the time she entered the\\n      hospital she walked to her carriage with her eyes and ears unprotected.\\n      She soon resumed her church and charitable work, in which she again takes\\n      much delight.\\n      \\n This woman wanted to get well. She was\\n      a woman of pure motives and high ideals. She had, in the language of Dr.\\n      Wesselhoeft, the wish, but, unaided, not the will. She required the aid of\\n      an intelligent, strong-minded, nurse who could bring to her exercise\\n      applied in such a way as to enable her to assimilate food without the\\n      expenditure of nerve force. She co- operated with her physician and nurse\\n      in every possible way, and as soon as the anaemic nerve cells became\\n      flushed with new blood she began to improve. To have commanded this\\n      patient \"to take up her bed and walk\" before improving her\\n      nutrition would have been as unscientific as to have placed the first\\n      patient in bed with extension and counter-extension applied to the limb. I\\n      know of no class of cases requiring for their successful treatment more\\n      tact and discrimination than that under consideration.\\n      \\n I feel confident that I have many times\\n      cut the affection short in its prodromal stage by removing the girl from\\n      college work and insisting upon open-air exercise. Static electricity has,\\n      in my hands, proved exceedingly useful both during the prodromal stage and\\n      that of convalescence.\\n      \\n I will conclude by saying that I have\\n      been impressed with the frequency with which an hereditary history of\\n      epilepsy has been met with in the cases of neurasthenia passing under my\\n      observation.'\n",
      " 'Tresorie - SOME OF THE DISEASES PREVENTING AND COMPLICATION PREGNANCY\\n[Diseases Preventing & Complicating Pregnancy]\\n\\n STERILITY.-DeSinety, Treub, Furbinger,\\n      et al., attribute 50 per cent. of unproductive marriages to the husbands,\\n      saying that sterility in the male is more often the cause of barren\\n      marriages than is generally supposed.\\n      \\n This cause of sterility I pass by, as\\n      also sterility due to mechanical obstruction, incomplete ovulation and the\\n      numerous other causes of this condition, too manifold for mere\\n      enumeration, to consider obesity as a causative agent in this condition. I\\n      need not say that the advocates for surgical interference for the relief\\n      of this condition are legion. Sims makes the assertion that sterility can\\n      be cured by surgical means only. That, of course, is Allopathic arguing\\n      pure and simple. Cases requiring surgical interference do arise, but any\\n      treatment which raises the nutrition of the entire organism, improves the\\n      blood-formation, and favors the resorption of pathological products in the\\n      sexual organs, is to be regarded as the indicated remedy.\\n      \\n Published statements are my authority\\n      for saying that excellent results have followed the administration of\\n      drugs, nevertheless; and in complete defiance of all therapeutic measures,\\n      a certain percentage of women remain barren; for with the more occult\\n      causes of sterility we remain, as yet, unacquainted, consequently they\\n      cannot all be reached with say kind of treatment whatever.\\n      \\n The following case I report somewhat in\\n      detail. Whilst not an exceptional case at all, it bears directly upon the\\n      subject under consideration, and possesses, it seems to me, some decidedly\\n      interesting features. My object in selecting this particular one is to\\n      call attention, if possible, to a condition not sufficiently considered.\\n      Mrs. J., aet. 26, married about two years and a half, appealed to my\\n      knowledge for a reason as to why she remained childless. The lady was\\n      carrying an excess of flesh, being under the medium height, and weighing\\n      186 pounds, but appeared to be in good health; family and previous history\\n      all that could be desired. Examination showed none of the common causes of\\n      sterility; neither, so far as I could ascertain, was the husband\\n      responsible for this unproductive condition of affairs. Some previous\\n      experiences of my own, with the added testimony of other and able men, was\\n      my reason for charging this condition of things to the excess of flesh,\\n      this, by the husband, being laughingly charged to excess of laziness.\\n      \\n We all, undoubtedly, are familiar with\\n      that peculiar disease of the blood-corpuscles which, whilst producing\\n      flesh, relaxes at the same time the muscular force; acting also, I\\n      believe, upon the muscular fibres of the uterus and upon the ovaries,\\n      inducing not only serious menstrual disorders but sterility. McKee,\\n      Philbert, and others give several instances of sterility chargeable to\\n      obesity, the women in question having been married several years without\\n      bearing children, and all became mothers after losing a portion of their\\n      flesh. If any other argument were needed in support of this theory we\\n      might turn to the quadrupeds, where we find the poorest breeders among the\\n      fleshiest animals. Fournel has a very able treatise on \"The Effects\\n      of Obesity on the Menstrual Functions and Parturition.\" Without\\n      having had any actual case of this description to deal with, he inclines\\n      very strongly towards the belief that obesity favors sterility. In the\\n      treatment of the case before mentioned, the patient was subjected to a\\n      daily massage of the entire body, with a special pelvic massage three\\n      times a week. This, in the main, consists in elevating the uterus as high\\n      as possible with the finger in the vagina, ending with a quick and decided\\n      vibratory motion. The diet received particular attention, as at this time\\n      there was a slight gastric ailment. The indicated remedy, Thuja, was given\\n      in the minimum dose. At the end of three months almost thirty pounds of\\n      flesh was gone, a considerable reduction. As an experiment, I recommended\\n      coitus in the knee-elbow position, advising that the lady remain quiet as\\n      long as possible after coition, with thighs well flexed. She became\\n      enciente, but miscarried at eight weeks. There was, comparatively\\n      speaking, but little pain and not much subsequent haemorrhage. She made a\\n      rapid recovery. Since then a living child has been born to them.\\n      \\n I believe I am safe in saying that this\\n      result would hardly have obtained were it not for the prophylactic\\n      measures adopted.\\n      \\n At the end of the first two months the\\n      patient was attacked with haemorrhage. A similar occurrence took place at\\n      irregular intervals during the following five months, the quantity of\\n      blood lost being much greater than that at the normal menstrual period.\\n      \\n For the greater part of the last five\\n      months she kept her bed, at the end of which time the tendency of the\\n      uterus to empty itself could be resisted no longer. A seven months\\' child\\n      was born, and is to-day doing well.\\n      \\n Pseudocyesis cerebral pregnancy,\\n      phantom pregnancy (whatever name we may call it by) is a disease which\\n      must come under the head of those \"complicating pregnancy.\" Mrs.\\n      M., a lady, married two or three years, aet. 29. Previous history good,\\n      always enjoying perfect health. When I first saw the lady in question she\\n      was a perfect picture of health, and, according to appearance and her own\\n      statements, about seven months pregnant. I made no examination. This\\n      appeared to be a thoroughly intelligent woman, and, according to her own\\n      statement, there was cessation of the menses. There certainly was an\\n      enlargement of the abdomen and breasts, a milky secretion, and the lady\\n      was sure that she felt foetal movement. On February 28th of the present\\n      year I was called to attend her in labor. Examination showed that no\\n      pregnancy existed. So far as I could ascertain there was no assignable\\n      origin for this condition other than nervous influences, the phenomena\\n      being purely muscular distension of the abdomen.\\n      \\n Mayham reports a case of a woman 73\\n      years old, claiming to be pregnant; he also claims that subsequently she\\n      was delivered of a child; this is an Allopathic report, however, of which\\n      we will take a Homoeopathic dose. Haultain reports three cases of cerebral\\n      pregnancy. In the first, he says no cause whatever was to be found; in the\\n      second, there was a small fibroid growth in the anterior uterine wall.\\n      Hauck reports a case where the vomiting, peristalsis, and flatus, caused\\n      by alcoholism were supposed to be caused by the pregnant state. Such cases\\n      are uncommon, but they emphasize the importance of making a thorough\\n      examination, in all cases where positive information is desired of the\\n      existence or non-existence of pregnancy.\\n      \\n Hyperemesis Gravidarum.-An animated\\n      discussion, held recently between two celebrated Allopaths of Stuttgart\\n      and Leipsic, has served to awaken a renewed interest in this subject,\\n      without in the least adding anything new to our stock of knowledge\\n      regarding its aetiology. Notwithstanding the frequency of the vomiting of\\n      pregnancy, its very distressing character in many instances, and its\\n      imminent, its very distressing character in many instances, and its\\n      imminent danger, we find but very few contributions of any value, to\\n      either the aetiology of the disorder or its therapeutics. I do not expect\\n      to add anything specially new myself, but it does seem to me that our\\n      knowledge of the vomiting of pregnancy, is to say the least, in a most\\n      contradictory state. Some physicians look upon it as a trifling matter,\\n      others as a thing to be endured, and some-these are in the right too-view\\n      even the mildest cases with gravity. Even in the mildest cases of morning\\n      sickness there is a constant drain upon the nervous system, putting the\\n      sufferer into a condition, in which she is very much less able to endure\\n      parturition than she would otherwise have been.\\n      \\n Dr. Harrison Mettler says: \"After\\n      careful inquiry I find that women who suffer from much morning sickness\\n      have as a rule, tedious or otherwise troublesome labors. I have observed\\n      in multiparae that at one time they will have much nausea and vomiting\\n      followed by a difficult labor, while at another time they will be quite\\n      free from the vomiting, and will pass through the succeeding labor with\\n      comparative ease.\" I must say my observations make me agree with Dr.\\n      Mettler entirely; when one thinks how rapidly the mildest of cases assume\\n      pernicious forms, indifference is certainly no longer to be excused. There\\n      is a voluminous literature upon this subject, and many and varied are the\\n      aetiological reasons given for this very variable affection, a large\\n      majority of writers coinciding in the opinion that \"many causes\\n      operate together,\" to produce what we are pleased to designate the\\n      \"vomiting of pregnancy.\" I believe myself that in a large\\n      percentage of cases, this pernicious vomiting is simply the result of a\\n      reflex neurosis. Undoubtedly uterine displacements frequently cause\\n      vomiting; but when this is so, and the displaced organ is raised by\\n      packing the vagina with aseptic wool, the vomiting ceases.\\n      \\n Lillie reports a number of cases, where\\n      obstinate vomiting was caused by a retroflexed uterus, and restoration of\\n      the organ caused a cessation of the disorder. Bezugloff having a\\n      persistent case of morning sickness, introduced a bougie it no the uterus,\\n      the intention being to produce abortion; the immediate result was a\\n      stoppage of the vomiting, and the pregnancy went on to full term.\\n      \\n In the case just cited, I must say that\\n      I believe it was the fright, caused by the thought of abortion being\\n      performed, more than the effects of introducing the bougie, which operated\\n      so successfully; I say now, as I said before, I believe that the\\n      pre-eminent cause of this kind of sickness must be looked for i the\\n      nervous system. Flint speaks of this form of sickness as being decidedly\\n      neurotic in its origin, and cites a number of cases of a chronic variety\\n      of dyspepsia frequently occurring in young girls. I had one such case come\\n      under my personal care. There was a persistent morning sickness, with this\\n      young lady, and a disagreeable nausea whenever food was taken; this\\n      patient was at some distance from her home, in a boarding school, and she\\n      will probably never know that the lady principal entertained very grave\\n      thoughts at one time in regard to her virtue. It certainly was very\\n      difficult to differentiate between this and the vomiting of pregnancy; it\\n      was, however, simply due to a vitiated nervous system. My theory is\\n      supported by Alt, who records a number of such cases; I cite one only, the\\n      case being that of a highly hysterical woman, six months pregnant,\\n      suffering from the gravest vomiting, and anxious that miscarriage be\\n      induced. She was making preparation for entering the hospital for this\\n      purpose, when one of her children was seized with pneumonia. The anxiety\\n      felt over the child, forced all thought of self from the mother\\'s mind;\\n      from that moment the vomiting ceased and she remained well until the\\n      termination of pregnancy.-Minchener Medicinische Wochenschrift.\\n      \\n Whilst saying that I believe this\\n      disease to be in the majority of cases of purely nervous origin, I would\\n      not imply thereby that it is not to be feared, far from it; if neglected,\\n      we know how likely it is to pass quickly beyond treatment and our patient\\n      succumb from sheer exhaustion.\\n      \\n In the treatment cited such as\\n      insertion of bougies, dilation of the os, pelvic massage, etc., I believe\\n      it is merely the \"doing something,\" no matter much what it is,\\n      so long as you have gained the confidence of your patient, that does good.\\n      We have seen how suddenly Hyperemesis will cease if the patient be\\n      alarmed; it may be, has often been, and will to again, cured by a process\\n      skin to suggestion. Kattenback had a case where the patient, a primipara,\\n      was seized with an incorrigible vomiting. It was suggested to her that her\\n      stomach contained some lumps of unwholesome material and their removal\\n      would cure her. Some milk was given her, and the stomach ceremoniously\\n      washed out. its contents bore no indications of either over-acidity or\\n      abnormal ferment She was informed that she was all right and the vomiting\\n      would not return; neither did if, and she was safely delivered at term.\\n      \\n There is a familiar and now well-know\\n      phenomena, by which these neurotics can be influenced; I speak of\\n      hypnotism; it is due to purely subjective conditions.\\n      \\n There is an identity of the hypnotic\\n      susceptibility with the condition of hysteria, and it is along these lines\\n      that we can work. Just as many times as I have tried this method of\\n      treatment, for these cases of excessive vomiting, just so many times has\\n      it given me gratifying results.\\n      \\n The patient can be to sleep by\\n      bi-ocular pressure, and the idea of cure suggested; the operation may have\\n      to be repeated several times, at intervals of a day or so, but you will be\\n      rewarded by the cessation of the vomiting, often with but one suggestion.\\n      Where the patient is not easily controlled by means of the bi-ocular\\n      pressure, Luy\\'s revolving mirror is a never failing resource.'\n",
      " 'Tresorie - PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS [Presidential Address]\\n\\n THE ROLE OF HOMOEOPATHY IN THE SECOND\\n      \\n By ALVA BENJAMIN, M.B.CH.B., F.F.HOM.\\n      \\n Such a system of medicine must\\n      recognize that it is as much an art as a science, and that healing is a\\n      relationship between two living personalities. It must recognize too, that\\n      the sick individual has to take an active part in his treatment and not be\\n      merely the passive recipient of this or that treatment. For just as it is\\n      rightly said that man does not live by alone, so should it be emphasized\\n      that man cannot be cured by medicine alone. He must see to it himself that\\n      he lives as far as possible a physically and psychically healthy life.\\n      Indeed, each individual has a power within himself to help in his own\\n      cure.\\n      \\n Do the official schools of medicine\\n      teach such an art today? I am afraid not: they are so intent on seeking\\n      the specific treatment for this or that named disease or the antibiotic\\n      that will most effectively put out of action the organism regarded as the\\n      cause of the disease, that they are losing sight of the individual\\n      himself.\\n      \\n But Homoeopathy in its persistent\\n      search for the reactions of the individual to his environment in the\\n      broadest sense, no matter of what the patient is complaining surely\\n      fulfills these requirements, especially when it is recognized that the\\n      homoeopathic potencies do not anything to the patient as do the drugs of\\n      the dominant school, but rather stimulate the patients own recuperative\\n      powers to overcome the infection or re - establish the normal metabolism\\n      which has become deranged by the illness.\\n      \\n When you consider how the homoeopathic\\n      physician diagnoses the individuality of his patient over and above the\\n      name of the disease from which he is suffering, and uses for the purpose\\n      of his prescription rather than the name of the disease this personal\\n      diagnosis of the patients mental and emotional reactions, his responses to\\n      changes in weather conditions, the alternations in his environment which\\n      influence his symptoms, etc., one realize how very individualistic is the\\n      Homoeopathic prescription fitted to that particular patient.\\n      \\n The homoeopathic physician does not\\n      seek for a remedy specific to any named disease and which he can thus\\n      apply almost automatically once he has made his organic diagnosis, which\\n      in quite an appreciable number of instances may ultimately be found to be\\n      wrong and so the treatment based upon it must therefore have been wrong.\\n      He does not, as is so often done, merely suppress the most outstanding\\n      symptom by an appropriate drug; for example giving an anodyne to mask the\\n      pain or removing the skin eruption by some strong local application, in\\n      other words putting the dust under the mat and pretending the room is\\n      clean.\\n      \\n Strangely enough the homoeopathic\\n      physician is often accused by his allopathic critic in his ignorance of\\n      Homoeopathy, of merely treating symptoms, whereas it is the critic himself\\n      who practices this superficial medicine. The homoeopathic physician, on\\n      the other hand, treats his patient as a whole through his symptoms and\\n      their modifications through changes in the environment, which is quite a\\n      different matter.\\n      \\n Homoeopathic therapy, unlike methods of\\n      treatment, is based on a natural law \"Similia Similibus\\n      Curentur\" \"Likes may be cured by likes\" which has been\\n      proved time and time again by experiment and which anyone with the will to\\n      do may prove for himself. It is not subject to constant change brought\\n      about by this or that latest discovery, and which itself will soon have to\\n      give way to the still later idea.\\n      \\n Having now introduced to you our actor,\\n      what of the scene in which he is to play his role?\\n      \\n This is the nineteen hundred and fifty\\n      - fourth year of the Christian era and the second year of the reign of our\\n      much loved and admired young Queen Elizabeth II, who will remember while\\n      in south Africa on her twenty - first birthday, before she had any idea\\n      that she would so soon be called to such an exalted position as she holds\\n      today, broadcast to the commonwealth and Empire her resolve to dedicate\\n      her life to the service of this grand community which dedication she\\n      recently repeated at her Coronation.\\n      \\n Here in Great Britain we have a more or\\n      less complete welfare state, with which idea some of us may very strongly\\n      disagree, whilst others believe such a development is the result of a\\n      natural very desirable social evolution.\\n      \\n As one necessary ingredient of this\\n      welfare state came, in 1948, the initiation of the National Health\\n      Service, through which the great majority of the population receives its\\n      medical attention, although it is rightly available to all.\\n      \\n When we come to consider the role that\\n      homoeo - therapeutics should play in this scheme, I would suggest that we\\n      should regard the problem from the purely medical aspect, forgetting any\\n      political party allegiances or sympathies we may have; or if we cannot\\n      forget them we should remember that the organization of the National\\n      Insurance Scheme of which the National Health Service is but a part, was\\n      first blue printed by the well - known Liberal supporter, Lord Beveridge,\\n      and the Health Service plans developed by the Coalition Government of all\\n      three major political parties.\\n      \\n We are living at present in an age\\n      which may very justifiably be regarded as a violent age in which have been\\n      developed so many appalling instruments of destruction, the use of some of\\n      which we are quite complacently accepting and from the use of others we\\n      are refraining, not because we consider them immoral, but simply through\\n      the fear of the wholesale destruction which would be caused by their use.\\n      We are seeing X-rays used in very high voltages in the treatment of\\n      cancer, we are being constantly remained of the use of dangerous drugs in\\n      medicine, without justification, in my opinion, bearing in mind the\\n      doubtful and evanescent ameliorations they produce and the violent\\n      surgical treatment of mental patients.\\n      \\n One further violence we should not\\n      forget is the way some of our foods are devitalized by the extraction of\\n      this or that portion of the natural product for purposes quite foreign to\\n      the well - being of the people who are to feed on them; or they are\\n      contaminated by the addition of this or that dangerous chemical, either\\n      during the growing of the plant, in the form of sprays, or as so called\\n      improvers in, for instance, the manufacture of white bread. It is very\\n      significant in this regard that quite a lot of attention is paid to the\\n      protection of the man who sprays the crops, but the right of the consumer\\n      to have uncontaminated food is slurred over by the unjustifiable statement\\n      that the amount of these chemicals so consumed is so small that it cannot\\n      have any bad effect on the consumer. We who practice Homoeopathy know how\\n      unwarranted is such a statement.\\n      \\n Can we homoeopathic physicians and\\n      patient hope to be able to do anything to make the still small voice of\\n      Homoeopathy heard in all this tumult, so that we may return to a saner and\\n      more healthful way of life and help our young Queen in her lifes work for\\n      the communitys sake?\\n      \\n Can we expect any help from the leaders\\n      of the medical profession? I am afraid not, because although I believe it\\n      accurate to state that there is a very slowly growing interest in, and\\n      tolerance of our work by individual doctors, the medical authorities are\\n      still, in their prejudice, strongly opposed to us. The London University\\n      still refuses to recognize our Hospital as a post - graduate teaching\\n      Hospital: the British Medical Association prohibits the formation of a\\n      homoeopathic section of its organization, and the Royal College of\\n      Physicians still refuses its membership to any one known as a homoeopathic\\n      physician. Yet in spite of this unfavourable environment, I firmly believe\\n      that there is a future for our method of therapeutics: but it will have to\\n      be pursued with courage, determination, foresight and energy. Surely if we\\n      believe as I do, that we are the guardians of a system of treatment\\n      destined to make our people healthier and therefore more efficient and\\n      happier, we would be failing in our duty to our country if we did not take\\n      every means in our power to acquaint the community at large with the\\n      advantages of this system and the dangers of ignoring it. This is a duty,\\n      not only of the profession, but also of the laity interested in\\n      Homoeopathy and who have experienced its benefits.\\n      \\n Every physician has two professional\\n      obligation to the community, that of preserving its health and that of\\n      endeavouring to restore it to being when it has fallen by the way.\\n      \\n The homoeopathic physician, thorough\\n      his knowledge acquired through the provings of drugs, even in\\n      infinitesimal doses, has, I believe, a very special responsibility as\\n      regards the prophylaxis of disease. It seems to me that a great deal of\\n      chronic ill health may quite conceivably be due to the manipulations of\\n      our foods and to the artificial manuring of the ground in which many of\\n      them are grown. Experiments have been carried our proving that plants\\n      grown in soil enriched by natural manuring, are much less prone to\\n      diseases than those grown with the help of artificial chemical manures. It\\n      seems a fairly justified conclusion that vegetables grown under these\\n      artificial conditions may quite well be deficient in something necessary\\n      for our perfect health. It is therefore incumbent upon the physician to\\n      advocate whenever possible the ingestion of healthily grown foods in the\\n      widest sense of that term.\\n      \\n The same duty applies when we consider\\n      the great amount of drugging in which the community at large indulges by\\n      its excessive smoking, particularly when aggravated by the practice of\\n      inhaling, and by the continued and prolonged use of drugs for this or that\\n      symptom, too often, unfortunately, though not always, on the prescription\\n      of their medical advisors.\\n      \\n There is a great lack throughout the\\n      community of any real enthusiasm for perfect health: we are only too prone\\n      to be content to follow like sheep, the unintelligent and harmful\\n      practices of the majority of our fellows.\\n      \\n Similarly in the curative realm, we\\n      homoeopathic physicians have special obligations.\\n      \\n When considering our position vis-a-vis\\n      the rest of the profession, we must never lose sight of the fact that our\\n      approach to the sick individual is a much broader and more comprehensive\\n      one than that of the dominant school. This latter prides itself on its\\n      scientific approach to its problems. One must, however, always be on ones\\n      guard against being hypnotized by that word scientific. The scientific\\n      aspect of any phenomenon or problem dealing with humanity is only one\\n      limited aspect of that problem. To get a complete picture one must\\n      consider other aspect, such as the aesthetic, emotional, maybe religious,\\n      and above all, perhaps one might say embracing all, the philosophical\\n      approach. This complex approach to his patients problem is the one that\\n      the homoeopathic physician always strives to adopt, and so never loses\\n      sight of the ego of the patient, while at the same time not forgetting his\\n      physical make - up.\\n      \\n Because this approach of ours to our\\n      patients is a much broader and more comprehensive one than the much\\n      vaunted scientific aspect, which the dominant school has come to regard as\\n      the Ultima Thule of medicine, I deplore the oft - repeated request of some\\n      of my colleagues that we should forsake our philosophy and make our work\\n      as scientific as theirs. I do not mean to imply by this that we should\\n      neglect the scientific angle of our patients illness but we should always\\n      remember that is only one facet of our problem. That is why we take such\\n      pains to diagnose our patients personality with his reaction to his\\n      environment in addition to the physical diagnosis of the case in order to\\n      arrive at our prescription for his malady. In other words, we should\\n      endeavour to lead our dominant school colleagues to our way of thinking,\\n      rather than that we should adopt theirs.\\n      \\n At the same time must always remember\\n      that if our philosophy should seem at any time to contradict so - called\\n      scientific laws, we must re - examine our philosophy, and if necessary\\n      modify it, while at the same time remembering that many times in the past\\n      what have been regarded as laws have ultimately been proved not to be so.\\n      Thus it is evident that we must never relax our self - examination.\\n      \\n What shall be the role of the\\n      homoeopathic laity?\\n      \\n The first thing for them to remember is\\n      that we are living in a democratic country whose government is dependent\\n      on the goodwill of the governed, and that, if a sufficient number of\\n      voters desire a certain line of action, that line will be adopted by the\\n      government.\\n      \\n The second thought is that there are\\n      not nearly sufficient doctors practising Homoeopathy in Great Britain to\\n      satisfy the present demand, let alone any further increased demand in the\\n      future, for this line of treatment.\\n      \\n Does not this seem strange, having\\n      regard to the great advantage to humanity that Homoeopathy provides? Not\\n      if one looks below the surface and so finds the reason for this shortage.\\n      \\n Surely the most potent reason is that\\n      Homoeopathy is not taught in the official Medical Schools, either as a pre\\n      - or post - graduate study. The London University when asked to recognize\\n      the Royal London Homoeopathic Hospital as a post - graduate Medical\\n      School, refused on the plea that as Homoeopathy was not taught in the\\n      undergraduate Medical Schools, it could not find a place for it in its\\n      post - graduate curriculum.\\n      \\n It is, of course, nonsense to suggest\\n      that a graduate should pursue his studies only in those subject of which\\n      he had already obtained some knowledge in his undergraduate days and\\n      should not wish to obtain information on any new or extra subject.\\n      \\n The University Medical Shools are\\n      enabled to a great extent through Government grants. We must therefore\\n      find some way of influencing whatever Government be in power to bring\\n      pressure to bear upon the London University to remove this obstacle to the\\n      better health of the community at large. I am quite satisfied that once\\n      this academic recognition is obtained we shave many more post - graduate\\n      students of Homoeopathy.\\n      \\n I believe than in a democratic\\n      community, having a universal State Medical Service, it is the bounden\\n      duty of the Government to remove all obstacles to the peoples obtaining\\n      that form of medical treatment in which they have confidence. So long as\\n      Homoeopathy is denied its legitimate status, so long must be Government be\\n      deemed to b failing in its duty to the country.\\n      \\n If, however, we are to achieve this\\n      desirable object of full recognition, we must all, professional and laity,\\n      be fired with enthusiasm, not only for the abstract cause of Homoeopathy,\\n      but for being partners with our young Queen in delicating our lives to the\\n      community.\\n      \\n When we do this we shall help to make\\n      this second Elizabethan era one to be remembered throughout the ages to\\n      come as surpassing the first Elizabethan era in that it gained not so much\\n      the economic and political leadership of the world - though that is not to\\n      be despised - but showed the way to the most healthful and spiritual way\\n      of life that all the world look notice and followed suit.\\n      \\n To sum up, the Role of Homoeopathy, as\\n      I see it, is to humanize the practice of medicine. By that I mean it must\\n      bring the practice of medicine into line with a reasoned philosophy of\\n      life, restore to it its artistry and rid it of all unnecessary hazards. It\\n      is to do this, not from any abstract academic sense of superiority, but in\\n      order the years to come are not those of merely another reign, but to\\n      ensure a veritable Renaissance, starting with the second Elizabethan era\\n      in which Great Britain will take its rightful place in the comity of\\n      nations as the pathfinder to a way of life for which posterity will be\\n      able to say \"Thank God for Queen Elizabeth the Second and her\\n      peoples.'\n",
      " 'Tresorie - Roentgenometric Pelvimetry [Roentgenometric Pelvimetry]\\n CHARLES W.PERKINS, M.D.\\n      \\n Norwalk, Conn\\n      \\n FOR some time the x-ray has been used\\n      to advantage in diagnosis of multiple pregnancy, position of fetus and\\n      fetal abnormalities. However, it has been only the past four or five years\\n      that any definite information has been obtained by roentgenographic\\n      methods of diagnoses in pelvimetry.\\n      \\n At the present time we are convinced\\n      that only by means of roentgenographs can be true proportions of the\\n      superior strait be determined, and that the ordinary external methods of\\n      Pelvimetry are not only occasionally misleading but proportionately\\n      inaccurate.\\n      \\n The present communication deals with\\n      the method of Herbert Thomas of Yale University. This method was developed\\n      in cooperation with the late Dr. W.A. Lafield, who was Professor of\\n      Roentgenology at the Yale Medical School.\\n      \\n Some of the reasons why roentgen\\n      pelvimetry has not been more universally adopted are probably due to the\\n      following factors.\\n      \\n (1) The majority of women will be\\n      delivered normally, whether or not pelvic measurements are made.\\n      \\n (2) The medical profession does not\\n      readily accept a new method after an established satisfactory routine has\\n      been in use.\\n      \\n (3) A new method of diagnosis incurs\\n      added expense.\\n      \\n (4) The present methods, although\\n      entirely speculative, are satisfactory in most cases.\\n      \\n (5) Roentgen pelvimetry cannot be\\n      performed by the obstetrician himself but requires the aid of a\\n      roentgenologist.\\n      \\n (6) The value of roentgenometric\\n      diagnosis is recent in origin and as yet not universally accepted.\\n      \\n If the knowledge of the size and shape\\n      of the pelvis is necessary to the practice of obstetrics, roentgen\\n      pelvimetry is a sound procedure, particularly in pre-emptors patients, and\\n      should and should be considered as an indispensable aid in these cases.\\n      \\n The method of Herbert Thoms as\\n      developed at Yale Medical School is not the only method. However, it can\\n      be classified as simple, accurate and rapid; being adaptable for use by\\n      other than experts in x-ray and obstetric diagnosis. As a technical\\n      procedure a well trained hospital technician can master its technic alter\\n      sufficient instruction.\\n      \\n Studies of recent years reveal the fact\\n      that external Pelvimetry fails to give uniform and accurate information in\\n      regard to the shape and size of the superior strait. This is often true of\\n      thin undersized individuals. In many patients of this type external\\n      measurements may suggest a contracted pelvis while the x-ray will show a\\n      relatively large pelvis with a subsequent natural labor and normal-sized\\n      child. On the other hand a stocky short person with similar external\\n      measurements will disclose a contracted pelvis which is an obstetric\\n      problem. Because of the apparent relationship between shortening of the\\n      transverse diameter and a secondary persistent occipito-posterior\\n      presentation, accurate information regarding this diameter is of clinical\\n      significance.\\n      \\n The observations of Thomas were made on\\n      twenty consecutive patients whose pelvis showed a relative or real\\n      shortening of the transverse diameter of the superior strait. In every\\n      instance a primary or secondary occipito posterior position was found\\n      after the patient was in labor. (Herbert Thoms, Surgery, Gynecology and\\n      Obstetrics, January, 1933). It therefore has been proved that an actual or\\n      relative shortening of a transverse diameter of the superior strait\\n      results in a limitation of space that is greater in the anterior than in\\n      the posterior half of the superior strait. Under these circumstances, when\\n      the head descends early in labor, the occiput is forced to rotate\\n      posteriorly.\\n      \\n The x-ray offers additional information\\n      in determining the size of the fetal head. It has been noted in x-ray\\n      examination of the unengaged fetal head that it lay with the transverse\\n      diameter of the superior strait, the occiput being either to the right or\\n      left; therefore, if roentgenogram of the patient is taken in the supine\\n      position with the fetus in the uterus, it will cast a shadow which is an\\n      enlarged profile of the head. The measurements of the occipital frontal\\n      diameter of the head can then be made. On numerous occasions this method\\n      of cephalometry, determining the diameter of the unmoulded head before and\\n      after cesarean section, has yielded accurate results. (Thomas, A.M.A.,\\n      February 24, 1934).\\n      \\n As experience increases in roentgen\\n      pelvimetry, the so-called labor test will be employed less. This, however,\\n      does not mean that the physician should not under estimate the importance\\n      of uterine contraction and the ability of the fetal head to mold. It has\\n      always followed that when something could be proved desirable in medicine\\n      for the better protection of the patient, such an advance would be\\n      demanded and eventually become routine. We may concede, therefore, that\\n      roentgen pelvimetry has a distinct place in the examination of every\\n      primiparous woman. In many instances, according to Thomas and others,\\n      external; measurements were normal but the x-ray examination revealed a\\n      contracted pelvis. On the other had, in certain patients whose external\\n      measurements suggested a cesarean section roentgen pelvimetry proved\\n      otherwise and they were subsequently delivered in a normal manner.\\n      \\n CENTIMETER GRID METHOD.\\n      \\n The procedure in this method may be\\n      summarized by stating the following:.\\n      \\n (1) The patient is placed on the\\n      roentgenographic table in the semi- recumbent position.\\n      \\n (2) The level of the superior strait\\n      above the sensitized film is established.\\n      \\n (3) The tube target is centered about\\n      five centimeters posterior to the symphysis, at thirty-two inches from the\\n      sensitized film, The exposure is made.\\n      \\n (4) The patient is removed from the\\n      table, the tube target and sensitized film remaining in situ.\\n      \\n (5) A lead plate, or centimeter grid,\\n      with perforations exactly one centimeter apart, is introduced into the\\n      same plane as that previously occupied by the superior strait and a second\\n      (flash) exposure is made on the same sensitized film as was used used in\\n      the previous exposure.\\n      \\n (6) Development of the film shows the\\n      outline of the superior strait and the shadows of the perforations, the\\n      assistance between which represents centimeters in the plane of the\\n      superior strait. The anteroposterior and transverse diameters of the\\n      superior strait in its use proportions may be drawn on centimeter-square\\n      paper by following the course of the shadow of the superior strait and\\n      transcribing it.\\n      \\n As this time I wish to express my\\n      thanks to Dr. Thoms for his personal advice and instruction which helped\\n      me to master the technic of his method.'\n",

      " 'Tresorie - THE EFFICACY OF THE VIBROMETER IN APPLYING VIBRATORY MASSAGE\\nIN AURAL DISEASES [Efficacy Of Vibrometer In Applying Vibratory Message In Aural\\nDisease]\\n\\n SINCE presenting my paper before the\\n      American Institute, in June of last year on \"Vibratory Motion as a\\n      Method of Massage in Aural Diseases,\" I have been using an instrument\\n      specially devised for that purpose called the \"vibrometer.\" This\\n      instrument is in shape like a banjo, and has four strings stretched across\\n      its length resting on a bridge, which sets upon a diaphragm. On each side,\\n      elevated above the diaphragm and supported by posts, are two horizontal\\n      bars, which support the mechanical appliances used for producing the\\n      various vibratory motions. This consists in what is called a yoke, in\\n      which revolves a shaft connected with the electro-motor by pulley-wheels\\n      and a belt. Behind the diaphragm is a shallow air-tight compartment,\\n      leading from which are rubber tubes that are inserted in the external\\n      auditory canal during treatment, consequently any vibratory motion of the\\n      diaphragm, which must necessarily be an inward and a corresponding outward\\n      movement, would be exactly reproduced upon the membrana tympani, as the\\n      confined air, not being able to escape, will undergo an alternate\\n      condensation and rarefication in the external auditory canal.\\n      \\n Every vibratory movement of the strings\\n      of the instrument is communicated to the diaphragm by means of the bridge\\n      upon which it rests. These strings by varying their tension and length can\\n      be regulated to give a high or low rate of vibration as desired, for\\n      instance, the heaviest string left at its original length adjusted to a\\n      slight tension may make about fifty vibratory motions to the second, while\\n      the highest string on the instrument adjusted to a high tension and\\n      clamped down to one-fourth its original length would probably make three\\n      thousand vibratory motions to the second.\\n      \\n In the centre of the diaphragm is an\\n      attachment which works on a lever, and when hit by the cam on the\\n      revolving shaft lifts the diaphragm to a considerable extent, causing a\\n      powerful effect on the membrana tympani. This attachment can be adjusted\\n      at four different leverages, which causes a modification or increase of\\n      its intensity and can be regulated at from one to twenty-five vibratory\\n      movements to the second. This is only used in very bad cases and for not\\n      more than five minutes continuously.\\n      \\n The instrument which I have been\\n      describing in an improvement on the first manufactured, and as far as I\\n      know, is the only one which offers the same facilities for applying this\\n      method of massage. The class of patients in my experience who are\\n      generally benefited from the first, are those in which the mucous membrane\\n      lining the tympanic cavity and Eustachian tubes is in a hypertrophic\\n      condition. The membrana tympani are depressed, opaque, and thickened. They\\n      usually complain of a stiffed sensation in the ears, with a great deal of\\n      tinnitus aurium, and that their hearing is worse during a cold. In cases\\n      where the mucous membranes are atrophied with a large external auditory\\n      canal perfectly dry and Eustachian tubes patulous, and generally very\\n      little tinnitus, this or no other treatment has done very much good in the\\n      majority of cases, and in looking ever my records I find that only about\\n      five per cent. have been relieved, while in the before-mentioned cases the\\n      good results reach at least seventy-five per cent. In treating persons, I\\n      always select the rate of vibration which corresponds in pitch, if\\n      possible, to that caused by the diseased condition of the ears. If there\\n      is no tinnitus to guide me, I find whether the patient can hear a high or\\n      low sound better; if it is a low sound, a high rate of vibration is used\\n      in treatment, and vice versa, A point which I would like to explain here\\n      is this: It is not necessary that the sound from the instrument should be\\n      of the same quality of the tinnitus experienced by the patient, but merely\\n      the same pitch. for instance, if a banjo, where one of the strings was\\n      adjusted when sounded to produce a certain note, and a musical instrument\\n      of any other kind, whose quality of tone was entirely different, was made\\n      to sound the same note in a room, the string on the banjo would vibrate in\\n      sympathy, which has been proven by experiment, any other note, no matter\\n      how loud, would have no effect. Another point is in the way the strings of\\n      the vibrometer are set in motion. On the revolving shaft is a wheel\\n      projecting from which are metallic picks which hit the string it is\\n      adjusted over. It does not make any difference in the number of vibratory\\n      motions per second, whether the string is hit fast or slow, but at the\\n      time the string is first hit the intensity is greater than it is just\\n      before being hit again, and as the motion of the wheel is perfectly\\n      rhythmic, revolving so many times to the second, it has just as good an\\n      effect as if the intensity during the fraction of a second did not vary at\\n      all. The idea of using vibratory motion, as I have said before, originated\\n      within my mind some years ago, and later put into practical operation, and\\n      as far as I know, was the first to lay before the profession in a\\n      scientific manner, this method of massage.\\n      \\n I have found that when two of the\\n      strings upon the vibrometer were regulated in such a way that when both\\n      were set in vibration at the same time, producing the sensation of a\\n      harmonious sound, the effect in some cases on the tinnitus was especially\\n      beneficial, relieving, where the various kinds of vibrations produced by a\\n      single string failed. Sub-acute cases of deafness, accompanied by tinnitus\\n      aurium, are quickly relieved, as the following case will illustrate:.\\n      \\n Mrs. M. Young, married lady, aet. 26,\\n      called at my office, April 1, 1893, complaining of partial deafness and\\n      tinnitus aurium. She had a stuffed sensation, or as if cotton had been\\n      packed in the external auditory canal. She says the tinnitus was so\\n      annoying as to prevent sleep. On examination, found considerable\\n      retraction of the membrana tympani, and hearing for the watch, on the\\n      right side five inches, on the left, seven inches. The Eustachian tube\\n      were partially closed, which made inflation somewhat difficult, giving\\n      slight relief. I used several of the vibrations on the different strings\\n      without immediate benefit.\\n      \\n April 4th.-She came again, and reported\\n      that no improvement had taken place. I again inflated her ears, after\\n      which she sat down to the vibrometer. The central attachment was used with\\n      considerable force continuously for four minutes, after which she declared\\n      that the tinnitus had entirely ceased in the right ear, and greatly\\n      modified in the left; the hearing for the watch had increased for both\\n      ears to fourteen inches, and the stuffed sensation had almost entirely\\n      disappeared. On inspection of the membrana tympani, found them\\n      comparatively very slightly retracted. On April 8th, found improvement had\\n      continued, when the same treatment was used for three minutes; after which\\n      she declared herself completely relieved of the tinnitus and stuffed\\n      sensation, with hearing powerfully restored. Saw her again on April 13th,\\n      when she declared the good results from last treatment to have still\\n      continued.\\n      \\n I find that in the majority of cases,\\n      when the strings of the instrument are used it is only necessary to strike\\n      them lightly with the friction wheel. In vibrating the heavy string, I\\n      generally set the bridge back behind the central attachment, and adjusting\\n      the motor in such way that the belt is at a considerable tension, so that\\n      the pulley-wheel revolves slowly. I also generally use this adjustment\\n      when setting in motion two strings at one time. The principle of this\\n      method of treatment embraces two essential features which to my mind makes\\n      this system of massage the only scientific one applicable to the membrana\\n      tympani and its associate sound-conducting parts. Message is the\\n      application of motion to disease, and its scientific administration\\n      consists of its application in a systematic manner. In applying massage in\\n      aural diseases, it is necessary to produce a to-and-fro movement of the\\n      membrana tympani, and, if possible, by a force which is harmless and at\\n      the same time effective. The vibrometer fulfils these conditions. Any of\\n      the strings on the instrument that may be set in motion by the\\n      friction-wheel, will produce a certain number of vibratory movements to\\n      the second of time, and the movements of the central attachment are also\\n      measured. What could be more systematic than this? The motions of the\\n      membrana tympani were intended by nature to its vibratory, and as the\\n      vibrometer generates measured motion, and these motions are vibratory,\\n      theoretically we have a scientific and effective method of massage in\\n      aural diseases; and, as demonstrated practically by the use of the\\n      vibrometer, we have in fact a great scientific advance over all previous\\n      methods. Since the introduction of this treatment in aural diseases, it\\n      makes possible a more or less benefit in cases of deafness heretofore\\n      considered hopeless, and has opened up the field for the treatment of\\n      aural diseases to such an extent that the number of deaf patients seeking\\n      relief at the aurist\\'s hands will at least double itself.\\n      \\n DISCUSSION.\\n      \\n H.C. HOUGHTON, M.D.: Dr. Garey\\'s\\n      admirable paper gives us the description of the vibrometer, an instrument\\n      devised under his personal direction and inspection, for the purpose of\\n      applying massage to the ear. It is the only instrument of the kind on the\\n      market, so far as I am aware, and after a somewhat prolonged use of it, I\\n      am prepared to recommend the latest production of the vibrometer company.\\n      \\n This instrument is a decided\\n      improvement over the instrument first sent out, and is capable of\\n      producing a most profound effect upon the drum-head and ossicula; indeed,\\n      upon the entire auditory apparatus. I am able to confirm Dr. Garey\\'s\\n      statement of the effect of high and low vibrations us regards treatment.\\n      \\n I have also been very much interested\\n      in the use of stringed or reed instruments for diagnosis, and find that we\\n      can detect any abnormal sensitiveness of the auditory nerve to high or low\\n      tones. Some patients are extremely sensitive to all tones, high or low;\\n      others to high tones and not to low tones; others, conversely. Again, in\\n      some instances, there is a peculiar sensitiveness to single tones or to\\n      discords produced by sounding the note and half-note at the same time.\\n      Under the action of the central attachment of the vibrometer this\\n      sensitiveness is modified, the sensitiveness to high tones disappearing\\n      and being replaced by a low tone or, conversely, under treatment, a low\\n      tone disappears and a high tone is established, temporarily, at least.\\n      Again, in cases of recent origin, treatment will substitute an undefined\\n      rushing sound for a definite musical tone, either high or low, and later,\\n      the treatment will abolish this, the patient being relieved of this\\n      intensely annoying symptom. In some cases, with this relief, there is an\\n      improvement in the audition; in other cases, no improvement follows.\\n      \\n I confess to the domination of the\\n      material over my mind in my earlier experience with massage, and I think\\n      the inclination of operators will be to use a far greater degree of power\\n      than is necessary. I therefore notice with great satisfaction Professor\\n      Garey\\'s remark that \"the object should be to produce a to-and-fro\\n      motion to the membrana tympani, and, if possible, by a force which is\\n      harmless and at the same time effective.\" I would hardly say\\n      \"to-and-fro motion of the drum-head,\" because I think that the\\n      expression is liable to perpetuate the motion which is fixed in the minds\\n      of most physiologists, that the drum-head moves as a whole, with a\\n      to-and-fro motion.\" That is true under the influence of the Politzer,\\n      Siegle\\'s otoscope and similar instruments; but it certainly does not so\\n      move in the ordinary function of audition, but stands as the iris does in\\n      the eye, as an adjustor, a regulator of sound-force; in some sense as the\\n      iris does in its relation with the lens, to adjust, regulate and direct\\n      the essential force, and the vibration of the drum-head is at every node;\\n      every portion receives impressions that are converted into molecular\\n      disturbances of varying lengths, according as they are produced upon the\\n      stiff and unyielding portions of the drum-head at the periphery, along the\\n      manubrium, or in the more attenuated and easily-yielding portions which\\n      the between these two areas. Not only so, but these impulses are\\n      communicated to the contained air of the tympanum, and make their\\n      impression upon the acoustic nerve through the round window synchronously\\n      with the impression made through the ossicula.\\n      \\n This whole subject widens before my\\n      mind in such a way that one might wish himself twenty years and at liberty\\n      to devote himself to a term of research in acoustics, such as is offered\\n      only in the technical schools of the continent of Europe.\\n      \\n WM. R. KING, M.D.: In discussing Dr.\\n      Garey\\'s paper I shall begin by saying that his methods have been closely\\n      followed by me since the beginning of his experiments, owing to the fact\\n      that I have been greatly interested in the treatment of deafness and\\n      tinnitus by means of sound waves or by aural massage since 1887, and have\\n      experimented and treated many cases by this method since then, though with\\n      crude and unsatisfactory instruments. Since using the vibrometer-which,\\n      after much study and experimentation, is now presented to the profession\\n      in practical shape-I have undoubtedly increased my percentage of good\\n      results.\\n      \\n I don\\'t believe I am over-sanguine or\\n      carried away by interest in this method, and believe I can rightly\\n      appreciate that this does not offer us a panacea or cure-all for auditory\\n      ailments, and hope I may always be ready to see the failures and to strive\\n      to find methods or remedies to reach some of them.\\n      \\n In speaking of the application of the\\n      instrument, I wish to call attention to the central attachment or post foe\\n      vibrations. Dr. Garey has not given it as much attention in the paper as\\n      it deserves. It is very useful as a general means of aural massage,\\n      rougher in nature and more general in application than the strings which\\n      help to make up the instrument. I often use it before applying the\\n      \"similar found\" to a given case, as a species of gymnastics, to\\n      stimulate secretion and motion in the conducting apparatus of the ear,\\n      viz., membrana tympani and ossicles. In most cases-in fact, in all-where\\n      tinnitus is present, I follow this up immediately by the nearest approach\\n      to the similar pitch obtainable.\\n      \\n I agree thoroughly with Dr. Garey, that\\n      the best results are achieved in cases accompanying hypertrophic catarrh,\\n      and that the least benefit is apparent in cases of atrophic nature.\\n      \\n Regarding the method of treatment in\\n      the absence of tinnitus, my experience the does not coincide with that of\\n      the author of the paper entirely; I do not feel that as yet we have any\\n      safe rule to guide us. My method has been to try the numerous sounds and\\n      variations the of until I find the one that seems to give the best\\n      immediate results, or that the patient himself will speak of as very\\n      penetrating and powerful )though not necessarily loud and heavy).\\n      \\n It seems almost impossible at present\\n      to simulate all the qualities of tone as they occur in the ears of those\\n      suffering with tinnitus; in fact, it would appear to be unnecessary.\\n      However, it seems advantageous and quite necessary to secure the closest\\n      simulation of pitch, thus in many cases soon obliterating annoying\\n      tinnitus and improving hearing powers.\\n      \\n The arrangement permitting of the\\n      picking of two strings simultaneously adds decidedly the usefulness of the\\n      instrument, as it increases the range of pitch as well as varying the\\n      quality of tones procurable, thereby decidedly enlarging our field of\\n      application.\\n      \\n The force used for creating the message\\n      or gymnastics of the membrana tympani and the ossicles-viz, vibratory\\n      force or sound- carefully and scientifically applied, is nature\\'s remedy,\\n      because it is adapted by nature, and is the only force which can rightly\\n      or safely be applied to these delicate portions of this complex organ of\\n      hearing.\\n      \\n A startling commentary on this subject\\n      is the array of cases benefited who have been relegated to the shelf by\\n      ancient and modern otology; cases declared unhelpable have been vastly\\n      improved. Pray, make no mistake; I did not say all cases.\\n      \\n It may be interesting to hear the\\n      latest regarding the instrument which was first invented for the\\n      application of this method of aural massage Mr. E.J. Godman, the inventor\\n      and patentee, is constantly on the lookout, and always striving for\\n      improvements to his machine. He has made many that you all know of. Permit\\n      me to report a few so recent they have not yet left the factory.\\n      \\n First.-The machine has been taken from\\n      its case, and is now mounted on a solid stand or table of oak, being set\\n      below the level, or so that the face of the instrument is just level with\\n      the face of the table. This is all supported by rigid, solid metal legs,\\n      which absolutely prevent foreign vibrations.\\n      \\n Second.-The motor has been removed from\\n      its little shelf and relegated below the table. I t can be placed upon a\\n      box on the floor, a shelf against the wall, or, better yet, a shelf\\n      solidly attached to the metal supports of the table. A belt goes up\\n      through an aperture to a wheel on a shaft, the other extremity of which\\n      carries a wheel with a rubber tire (a friction wheel), which in its\\n      revolution, being in contact with a larger flat- surfaced wheel on the\\n      main shaft of the instrument, turns this in harmony with itself. This\\n      arrangement does away with the necessity of shifting the motor each time\\n      you wish to shift the carriage from one string to another- a consummation\\n      to be devoutly thankful for. The removal of the motor from the instrument\\n      as at present attached will recommend itself to all who have used the\\n      vibrometer, a great amount of undesirable jar being thus avoided.\\n      \\n Third.-Ratchet keys capable of very\\n      fine adjustment of tension of strings are now provided for the instrument.\\n      \\n Fourth.-A rheostadt or resistance-coil\\n      is now to be placed beneath the table between the storage battery and the\\n      switch, by this means enabling us to control the speed and number of\\n      revolutions to a nicety.\\n      \\n Other, though comparatively minor,\\n      improvements are being made, and others are contemplated, as, for\\n      instance, the substitution of a roughly corrugated rubber band for the\\n      picker on the wheel, thereby getting rid of the metallic sound of the\\n      picker on the wire strings.\\n      \\n I have experimented with a number of\\n      appliance for the production of the sounds and pitches that I have\\n      required, but I always fall back on the vibrometer, especially as at\\n      present constructed, for satisfactory work and results.\\n      \\n This instrument may be, and probably\\n      is, as yet, in its infancy. It, and the method it applies, can only be\\n      perfected by constant work and experimentation both on the part of the\\n      profession and of the manufacturers. Each improvement we can suggest, if\\n      it only should serve as a means of helping one solitary case, would be\\n      well worth our while.\\n      \\n The experiments being made by different\\n      methods for treating deafness by sound waves is indicative of the interest\\n      the profession has taken in the matter. It is indicative of a lack of\\n      something in our usual armamentarium which is greatly longed for by\\n      patient and doctor; that is, the means for making the deaf hear and for\\n      relieving distressing tinnitus. There has been a dearth in this direction,\\n      and perhaps there still is, but I believe fully that we have in aural\\n      massage by vibratory force a decided acquisition at our hands.\\n      \\n E. H. LINNELL., M.D.: I would simply\\n      like to ask Dr. King how long he uses the instrument, and whether he uses\\n      it according to the deafness.\\n      \\n DR. KING: Yes, decidedly. In an intense\\n      case of deafness I would have to use it a great deal longer. The central\\n      attachment I never carry over three or five minutes, and the whole\\n      treatment I don\\'t think is over carried over twenty or twenty-five minutes\\n      in one case, and usually averages from ten to fifteen.\\n      \\n HAROLD WILSON, M.D.: I have only to\\n      suggest, what I have elsewhere called attention to, the possibility of\\n      another mechanical device for securing vibratory motion. It is well known\\n      that in the make and break of a current of electricity, in the circuit of\\n      which there is a telephone, we get an influence upon the make and break of\\n      the current in the telephone. Now, it is a simple matter with which these\\n      makes and breaks are made as to obtaining any number of vibration that you\\n      wish. You may, by a mechanical device of some rotary motion, if you\\n      choose, make and break the current as rapidly as you please until you have\\n      reached several thousand vibrations a second, or you may even make the\\n      vibrations so slow us to be easily counted. The application of this\\n      suggestion has been put in force in my own practice, more or less, in the\\n      use of the telephone as connected with the induction-coil ordinary\\n      battery. The more intense the current, the more intense the sound. You can\\n      easily see that it is mere question of mechanics to secure these two\\n      sounds-intensity of vibration and rapidity of vibration. I will say,\\n      furthermore, that it has this advantage. There is no noise in the office,\\n      which I think is not altogether true of the vibrometer. I would suggest\\n      that so far as the vibrometer is concerned, if it could be made to be\\n      noiseless to anybody but the patient, it would be a decided improvement.\\n      In that respect the telephone is a decided improvement, because there is\\n      no noise except to the patient, because the noise is right at the ear of\\n      the patient. If I were seeking for a perfected instrument in this line, I\\n      would go outside of the banjo idea. As we have the most perfect writing\\n      machines, which have no connection with the ordinary method of writing,\\n      and sewing machines, which have no connection with sewing by hand, so it\\n      occurs to me that possibly the securing of he vibratory motion upon the\\n      ears might be obtained in a totally different way from that which you get\\n      when you listen to the drum of the guitar or an ordinary musical\\n      instrument, and I would suggest that the make and break of a telephone\\n      open a very fruitful field for mechanical experimentation.\\n      \\n H.C. HOUGHTON, M.D.: In my study of\\n      this subject I made the acquaintance of Mr. Bernhardt, of New York City,\\n      who is a personal friend of Mr. Emil Berliner, the inventor of the Emil\\n      Berliner Telephone, which is the instrument by which the Bell Telephone\\n      Company maintain their monopoly at present. Mr. Berliner is the inventor\\n      of the graphophone, and has, I think, covered this whole matter which Dr.\\n      Wilson has mentioned. As ordinary Bell telephone receiver is put into the\\n      circuit of an ordinary induction machine, and you can use it just as the\\n      English people use the audiometer, and as you remove the coil you modify\\n      the vibrations, which is covered with another disk and a tube, and that\\n      tube covered with a stethoscope tube, which is the same as we use for the\\n      phonograph or vibrometer, and, as Dr. Wilson has suggested, you can modify\\n      the intensity, and of course the whole matter is adjusted by the\\n      attachment of the cord, so that you can have fine vibrations. The\\n      intensity of the vibrations is regulated by the distance to which you\\n      uncover the cord. The only difficulty in the adjustment is that it has\\n      been so severe that it is really uncomfortable, and the noise of the\\n      instrument is reduced to the minimum for office use.\\n      \\n A.B. NORTON, M.D.: I will also add that\\n      in regard to the objection Dr. Wilson makes to the noise, there is no\\n      doubt it is an annoying thing in the office, and in that line I have some\\n      men at work on my suggestion. We are devising another machine, or\\n      instrument, which is to be entirely enclosed in a cabinet, so there will\\n      be no noise whatever in the room if it is made a success. The idea is a\\n      little crude, and I am quite uncertain whether it will amount to anything\\n      or not. Then, in the line of what Dr. King was speaking in regard to Mr.\\n      Goodwin-he called, at New York, to see me last week. I made two little\\n      suggestion to him, which I think would be in line with his advancement.\\n      One is the number of the picks. The present vibrometer has four picks I\\n      suggest the experiment of trying twelve or sixteen picks, which will make\\n      a more continuous sound; it may be of some value. Then, in regard to\\n      regulating the speed of the machine: you regulate that now by a series of\\n      buttons, so as to get three different speeds. We will have a very slight,\\n      intermediate speed, and a very rapid speed. My experience with the\\n      vibrometer is especially favorable. I think the idea is in the right\\n      direction, and it is simply a matter of instrumentation.']\n",

Dietary sources of vitamin C include fruits and vegetables, particularly citrus fruits such as oranges.Severe deficiency of vitamin C causes scurvy. Although rare, scurvy results in severe symptoms and can cause death. People with scurvy are treated with vitamin C and should be under medical supervision.Many uses for vitamin C have been proposed, but evidence of benefit in scientific studies is lacking. In particular, research on asthma, cancer, and diabetes remains inconclusive, and a lack of benefit has been found for the prevention of cataracts or heart disease.The use of vitamin C in the prevention or treatment of colds remains controversial. Extensive research has been conducted. Overall, vitamin C lacked an effect on the development of colds and on cold symptoms. However, the duration of the cold shortened slightly. Notably, people living in extreme circumstances, including soldiers in the subarctic, skiers, and marathon runners, had a 50% decrease in the risk of developing a cold. This area merits additional research and may be of particular interest to athletes or people in the military.'\n",

Vitamin B12 is frequently used in combination with other B vitamins in a vitamin B complex formulation. Vitamin B12 is important in DNA synthesis. Vitamin B12 is bound to the protein in food. Acid in the stomach releases B12 from protein during digestion. Once released, B12 combines with a substance called intrinsic factor (IF) before it is absorbed into the bloodstream.The human body stores several years\\' worth of vitamin B12 in the liver, so low levels in the body are rare. Decreases in vitamin B12 levels are more common in the elderly, HIV-infected persons, and vegetarians. Inability to absorb vitamin B12 from the intestinal tract can cause a type of anemia called pernicious anemia. Fever and symptoms of \"excessive sweating\" have been reported with anemia due to low levels of vitamin B12; however, these are fixed with vitamin B12 treatment.'\n",

This is based on results. They are not\\n      hopeless cases; they are still hopeful and they get well under\\n      radiotherapy. This has happened during the last three years, not because I\\n      have changed any but because the method of radiotherapy has changed. A\\n      great change has taken place. First of all, radium and x-rays are no\\n      longer looked on a last resort.\".\\n      \\n The foregoing bears witness to the\\n      progress made in the field radiation therapy. The manufacture of more\\n      adequate apparatus and the improved technic in its use reflect this\\n      improvement. Machines are used generally delivering twenty to thirty\\n      milliamperes of current at 200 K.V., while machines operating at 750 to\\n      1,000 200 K.V., using lower milliamperes, have been installed in several\\n      places in this country. Since the question of increased voltages began to\\n      dominate the field, machines operating at 400 to 600 K.V., using sealed\\n      tubes, have been manufactured in this country as well as on the been\\n      manufactured in this country as well as on the continent. This higher\\n      powered machines occupy little more space than the usual 200 K.V. machine.\\n      \\n The effectiveness of these stronger\\n      radiations is thought to be due to (1) the increased penetration and its\\n      consequently larger percentage depth doses, (2) the supposed higher\\n      selective action of short have length radiation on malignant cells, and\\n      (3) greatly increased x-ray output. Clinics using super-voltages report\\n      that clinical results are somewhat better than those secured through the\\n      use of the lesser voltage machine.\\n      \\n Experimental effort, from the physical\\n      and biologic point of view, has been exerted to establish to standard\\n      basis for radiotherapy since Roentgens discovery thirtyfive years ago, and\\n      its application five years later. Radiotherapists have only recently begun\\n      to understand the principles of clinical application or radiotherapy in\\n      the treatment of malignant conditions.\\n      \\n Regaud selected the rabbits testicle\\n      for his experiments because its histologic cellular structure was highly\\n      sensitive to radiation, containing cells which are in a state of active\\n      mitosis resembling that of malignant tissue. In 1922, Regaud reported that\\n      of malignant, tissue. In 1922, Regaud reported that it was impossible to\\n      sterilize the testicle by a single dose of radiation without causing\\n      serious damage to the overlying skin. The dose required to produced such\\n      radio necrosis was equivalent to about three radionecrosis was equivalent\\n      to about three erythemas when administered in one dose. However, by\\n      dividing the dose in such a manner as to prolong the treatment over a\\n      period of fourteen days, a total dose of about five erythemas could be\\n      given causing complete sterilizations without damage to the skin. Thus it\\n      is seen that by prolonging the time of treatment the cutaneous dose could\\n      be increased nearly 50 per cent without causing necrosis.\\n      \\n The above experiments were reported,\\n      and the same results determined, by Schinz and Slotopolsky in 1926, and\\n      again by Regaud and Ferroux in 1927. These experiments formed the\\n      foundation for the clinical studies of Pfahler (America), Hohlfelder\\n      (Germany) and Coutard (France), who have swung the pendulum from massive\\n      radiation, as advocated by the German school, to that of the protected\\n      fractional dose method. Results have been achieved by this method which\\n      are superior to previously reported; these are obtained by the improved\\n      method of administering a large dose to the (3 days) without causing\\n      destructive effects to the surroundings normal structure (or cancer bed);\\n      its effect are rather biologic than physical. The clinical application of\\n      the method of radiation by Pfahler, Countard, and Berven (Sweden) in the\\n      treatment of cancer of the tonsil, pharynx and larynx and have proved the\\n      radio-sensitive properties of squamous carcinoma, previously considered\\n      incapable of of responding to radiation.\\n      \\n According to Coutard, the neoplasm is\\n      exposed to x-rays twice daily, giving a total dose of 350 r to400 r to two\\n      areas, using 190 to 200 k.v., four milliamperes, two millimeters of copper\\n      and three millimeters of aluminum filtration at a distance of fifty of\\n      sixty centimeters, for lesion of the head and neck. For deeply situated\\n      lesions, such as cancer of the uterus, the focal distance varies from 80\\n      to 100 centimeters, the area of the field for the head and neck conditions\\n      being only 50 to 100 square centimeters, while those of the lower abdomen\\n      require on an average of 250 to 300 square centimeters. For the\\n      sterilization of the radio-sensitive squamous carcinomatous growth, a\\n      depth dose of 3,000 r to 4,000 r is given, while stronger dose is\\n      necessary for the radio-resistant tumors.\\n      \\n In the course of treatment of principle\\n      guides a radio reaction of the covering epithelium and the radio reaction\\n      of the cancer cells. The radio reaction of the cutaneous epithelium is\\n      called \"radio epidermitis.\"characterized by loss of epithelial\\n      layers and denudation of the dermis. The reaction of the mucous membrane ,\\n      called \"radio epithelitis,\" manifests itself by loss of the\\n      epithelial layer sand denudation of the mucous membrane, epithelial layers\\n      and denudation of the corium which becomes covered by a fibrinous and\\n      false membrane; of clear. The duration of both describe radio reactions is\\n      six weeks. Each appears at the beginning of three weeks and disappears at\\n      the beginning of the ninth week.\\n      \\n Should the total or daily dose or the\\n      intensity per minute be too high, or the filtration or the tension too\\n      low, the cancer bed would be modified. the nutrition of the malignant\\n      cells becomes impaired The cellular radio- sensitivity, which seems to be\\n      linked up not only with the mitosis of the cell but above all with the\\n      activity of their interchange with the cell but above all with the\\n      activity of their interchange with the surrounding normal structures,\\n      becomes diminished and at times suppressed. The cancer cells become\\n      incentive to radiation. This phenomenon is called \"radio-\\n      vaccination\" by Regaud.\\n      \\n Observation of clinical facts shows\\n      that changes in the surrounding normal tissue result from excessive daily\\n      doses and intensity per minute per minute causing radio resistance of the\\n      tissue. Conversely, radio- sensitivity would be prolonged with a smaller\\n      daily dosage and the resultant extended period.\\n      \\n Realizing that better results may be\\n      obtained by prolonged treatment, Coutard and his collaborators in the last\\n      few years have begun to extend the duration of treatment of certain\\n      so-called radio-resistant cancers from thirty to ninety days, giving weak\\n      daily doses in order of about 175, 220, 225 and 250 r per day, dividing\\n      the dose in two treatments. By this method he was able to cure a certain\\n      number of lesions on which he had not been able previously to obtain the\\n      same results, such as very differentiated epidermoid epithelioma invading\\n      the muscles and cartilages, glandular epithelioma of the breast ad the\\n      thyroid body, and special round celled epitheliomas of the upper part of\\n      the ethmoid and the adjacent sinuses. This mode of prolonged treatment not\\n      only controlled the condition locally but it lessened the frequency of\\n      metastasis.\\n      \\n When radiating a cancer of very\\n      embryonic, very radio-sensitive growths, the energy factor is predominant.\\n      The action of the x-rays seems to be direct and rapid; the treatment can\\n      be accomplished within fifteen to twenty days. The cells are destroyed and\\n      generally normal structures are affected very little. When radiating the\\n      less embryonic type of growths, the time of treatment should be longer.\\n      \\n Pursuing these general principles, I\\n      have adopted the Countard method with some slight modifications. The cures\\n      which I shall illustrate will show that the percentage of cures in a\\n      number of most dangerous epidermoid carcinomas has markedly increased and\\n      that some conditions formerly considered hopeless have been temporarily\\n      cured. In conclusion I wish to emphasize the following facts:.\\n      \\n (1) Cure of cancer by x-rays is still\\n      difficult and must not be entered into lightly and causally.\\n      \\n (2) Radiotherapy is just as radical in\\n      method as surgery, and requires great skill, judgment and experience.\\n      \\n (3) The cooperation of the pathologist\\n      and the radiotherapist is imperative for a proper estimate of the\\n      radio-sensitivity in relation to treatment of the lesion.\\n      \\n (4) Daily examination of the patient is\\n      necessary; modification of the normal structure and general reaction by\\n      the x-ray treatment sometimes appears to quickly that it is often\\n      necessary to diminish the daily dose or the size of the field in the\\n      course of treatment.\\n      \\n (5) There exists no fixed method of\\n      treatment, only a simple clinical treatment for each individual patient\\n      and for the special type of tumor..\\n      \\n (6) Improvement in roentgen apparatus\\n      of higher voltages, producing more penetrating rays, will permit a better\\n      relation between destruction of malignant cells and preservation of the\\n      supporting, and the radio sensitivity of the tumor may be prolonged.'\n",

But why is it not spreading sufficiently and\\n      adequately in our motherland or in fact anywhere in the world? Why is our\\n      National Government not still keen on according official recognition to\\n      this superb system of healing art or providing ways and means for its\\n      development and diffusion? Why the public opinion is not gaining strength\\n      enough to put sufficient pressure on our Government to take interest in\\n      it? Why sufficient number of fully equipped Homoeopathic teaching\\n      institutions and hospitals are not growing to turn out adequate number of\\n      fully qualified Homoeopathic physicians in the country?\\n      \\n It is high time that we should draw the\\n      attention of the profession and the laity to provide answers to so many\\n      \"whys\" and to solve the pressing problems in the matter\\n      concerned. On a cursory view it becomes evident that the Homoeopathic\\n      profession, the people and the Government are each individually and\\n      collectively responsible for this impasse.\\n      \\n The so - called Allopathy still\\n      occupies the dominant place in any country, even in the land of birth of\\n      Homoeopathy. It is no wonder that Homoeopathy, being a discovery of merely\\n      a century and a half still lags behind its rival shool. But it is a wonder\\n      of wonders that Homoeopathy has already encompassed the whole world within\\n      such a short period since it was ushered into existence by Hahnemann.\\n      History of man reveals that nowhere a new truth was accepted by him easily\\n      and readily, obsessed as he is with conservatism, tradition, authority and\\n      vested interests. Nonetheless the triumphant march of Homoeopathy with a\\n      such a meteoric speed throughout the length and breadth of the world is a\\n      proof positive of the truth inherent in the system and phenomenal\\n      therapeutic efficacy of this healing art. It is one more glaring instance\\n      of mans love of truth against heavy odds that impede his progress at every\\n      step.\\n      \\n For the propagation of any new truth\\n      and its acceptance by man, in general, the first and foremost condition is\\n      the turning out of sufficient number of persons who have realised the\\n      truth and are adept in the practice of it. This involves establishment of\\n      a sufficient number of teaching institutions which will turn out experts\\n      in the science and art of Homoeopathy; and a sufficient number of\\n      Homoeopathic Hospital where, the efficacy of this system of treatment will\\n      be put to test.\\n      \\n Human knowledge is becoming\\n      unmanageably vast. The appearance of specialists has become indispensable.\\n      So special Hospitals for the treatment of specific types of diseases have\\n      sprung forth elsewhere, e.g. Tuberculosis Hospitals, Cancer Hospitals,\\n      Hospital for Tropical Diseases etc. Because of organisation of these\\n      hospitals people generally think of getting themselves treated in these\\n      institutions. As there are no fully - equipped general Homoeopathic\\n      Hospitals and not to speak of special Homoeopathic Hospitals and not to\\n      speak of special Homoeopathic Hospitals the result is Homoeopathy is not\\n      getting a fair chance of treating those diseases like tuberculosis,\\n      cancer, acute infectious diseases of epidemic type e.g., Small-pox,\\n      Cholera etc. on a large and organised scale. Consequently the general\\n      public cannot keep much faith in this treatment and mostly take recourse\\n      to homoeopathic treatment when the case is \"past all hope and past\\n      all surgery\". Hence the establishment of fully - equipped\\n      Homoeopathic institutions (College - cum - Hospitals) is an imperative\\n      necessity for enhancing the prestige of the Homoeopathic profession and\\n      for convincing the people about the therapeutic efficacy of this system of\\n      treatment. Is it not a pity that Homoeopathy once established its\\n      reputation by treating Cholera cases in this city and now nobody thinks of\\n      this treatment in Cholera cases and rushes the patient to the Allopathic\\n      Hospitals which are especially meant for these types of patients? How can\\n      we hope to gain ground under these circumstances?\\n      \\n The next great obstacle is the apathy\\n      and in many cases active antagonism of our Government, both at the Centre\\n      and at least in some of the State, towards Homoeopathy. The Government is\\n      under the thumb of its medical directorates which are solely manned by\\n      Allopathic doctors. The main reasons for the non - acceptance of the\\n      Homoeopathic system of treatment may be summed up in three words:\\n      tradition, authority and professionalism. Their psychology is easily\\n      understood if it is borne in mind that the conservative inertia of human\\n      mind attempts to reject any new thought will all the means at its\\n      disposal. Another reason is due to vested interests. Even a cursory glance\\n      at the history of origin and spread of Homoeopathy, enables one to find\\n      out that the opposition to this system from the start, was not scientific\\n      but rather of commercial nature on the part of the apothecaries who were\\n      afraid of losing their trade - profits. We regret to note that the Central\\n      Government have not yet implemented a single recommendation put forward by\\n      the Homoeopathic Enquiry Committee, Planning Commission. Third Health\\n      Ministers Conference, Ad Hoc Committee etc. though Homoeopathic Acts have\\n      been passed in the States of Bombay, U.P., Madhya Pradesh, Travancore -\\n      Cochin, Bihar etc. I is curious to note that W. Bengal is the only State\\n      where a Homoeopathic Bill has recently been thrown out by the State\\n      Government.\\n      \\n Another great obstacle is the\\n      psychology of the general mass of population who fail to adopt a proper\\n      philosophical attitude towards Homoeopathy and takes the Homoeopathic\\n      Therapeutic Law as great paradox contrary to common sense. Unless we can\\n      educate the public in the matter, we cannot hope to secure their whole -\\n      hearted support for this system of treatment.\\n      \\n Lack of enthusiasm for constructive\\n      works on the part of the Homoeopathic profession, the apathy of our\\n      Government and hesitancy on the part of the public to accept Homoeopathy\\n      are great obstacles to the spread of this system of treatment in the\\n      country. Unless this vicious circles is broken the progress of Homoeopathy\\n      is bound to be impeded. We have to fight on all fronts if we aspire to\\n      achieve victory in our battle for the cause of Homoeopathy and the\\n      suffering humanity.\\n      \\n But our first necessity as pointed out\\n      by the Soul of India expressing itself through Sri Aurobindo, is: If India\\n      is to survive and do her appointed work in the world, the youth of India\\n      should learn to think, to think on all subjects, to think independently,\\n      fruitfully, going to the heart of things, not stopped by their surface,\\n      free of pre - judgements, shearing sophism and prejudice asunder as with a\\n      sharp sword smiting down obscurantism of all kinds as with a mace of\\n      Bhima.\\n      \\n \"Let our brains no longer, like\\n      European infants, be swathed with swaddling clothes; let it have recover\\n      the free and unbound motion of the Gods, let it have not only the\\n      minuteness but the wide mastery and sovereignty natural to the intellect\\n      of Bharata and easily recoverable by it if it once accustomes itself to\\n      feel its own power and be convinced of its own worth.\\n      \\n \"The old fixed foundations have\\n      been broken up, we are tossing in the waters of a great upheaval and\\n      change. It is no use clinging to the old ice - floes of the past, they\\n      will soon melt and leave their refugees struggling in perilous waters. It\\n      is no use landing ourselves in the infirm bog, neither sea nor good, dry\\n      land of a second - hand Europeanism. We shall only die there a miserable\\n      and unclean death.\\n      \\n \"No we must learn to swim and use\\n      that power to reach the good vessel of unchanging truth; we must land\\n      again on the eternal rock of ages.\"\\n      \\n Yes, we must expand, we must assimilate\\n      whatever is assimilable for our growth. Stagnation and contraction are the\\n      signs of Death. Our knowledge must be aggressive, must diffuse through the\\n      rank and file of the whole Homoeopathic profession if we wish to survive\\n      and perpetuate ourselves; to leave an extensive ignorance either below or\\n      around us is to expose ourselves to the perpetual danger of being\\n      exterminated as a professional entity.\\n      \\n In fine, I welcome you, once again, on\\n      this historic occasion to this historic city to deliberate, to exchange\\n      view points and to come to agreed decisions with regard to our future line\\n      of action in respect of Homoeopathy in all its aspects.'\n",
      " 'Tresorie - SOME OBSERVATIONS ON NEURASTHENIA AND ITS TREATMENT\\n[Neurasthenia & Treatment]\\n\\n WHEN, thirty-five years ago, the writer\\n      first made the acquaintance of what is now called neurasthenia, it was\\n      known as spinal irritation, and the best of modern researches have been\\n      unable to give a better definition beyond a functional disturbance of the\\n      spinal and cerebral nerves, dependent on a morbid process, for which\\n      \"irritation\" is as proper a term as any. As deaths do not occur,\\n      autopsies throw no light on the subject. Briefly stated, neurasthenia,\\n      when observed from the beginning through its chronic course, has a period\\n      of prodromal symptoms followed by a protracted acute, and succeeded by a\\n      still more protracted chronic, state, between the end of which and the\\n      beginning of convalescence there is a very vague, often indiscernible,\\n      boundary line.\\n      \\n The prodromal symptoms are quite\\n      indefinite and very variable, pointing to nothing in particular. Loss of\\n      appetite, irregular sleep, excitability alternating with lassitude, etc.,\\n      are often overlooked, especially when the second stage-display of unusual\\n      mental and physical energy without subsequent fatigue- becomes apparent.\\n      This is often mistaken for a sign of unusually good health. When a young\\n      girl or mature woman, married or unmarried, feels that she can study ten\\n      hours a day and devote half of her night to pleasure or business; when\\n      besides much mental occupation she begins to rejoice in long walks without\\n      fatigue, that is the time when the mischief is going on without exciting\\n      timely suspicion. Relief is at last sought when the functional disorder of\\n      the nerves has gone to the opposite extreme, and becomes manifest in what\\n      is properly and popularly termed \"nervous prostration,\" when\\n      instead of having no sense of fatigue, the best bodily or mental effort\\n      seems intolerable, in grave cases rendering the patient a helpless being,\\n      completely dependent on the unremitting assistance of others whom she )it\\n      is usually a woman) rules with the inexorable power of the vis inertiae.\\n      \\n During this usually very protracted\\n      period of the disease convalescence usually sets in, but so imperceptibly\\n      that the physician alone can sometimes estimate its progress, which is\\n      unnoticeable to others towards whom the patient acts as she has for months\\n      or years. This is the time for action, too often delayed from motives of\\n      misplaced sympathy on the part of relatives and friends.\\n      \\n The affections is in many instances\\n      limited to the spine, the mind becoming only secondarily tired. In other\\n      cases it is spinal and cerebral; in others again chiefly cerebral. The\\n      line between this and insanity is always clearly definable. Though a\\n      neurasthenic patient may become insane, and probably the reverse, yet both\\n      are distinct conditions.\\n      \\n Books speak of this disease at common\\n      to men and women. Yet in this region in small towns as well as in large\\n      cities the cases of neurasthenia in women are preponderatingly great.\\n      \\n Hypochondriacs and hysteria stand in\\n      peculiar relation to neurasthenia. They maybe regarded as different\\n      species of the same genus; that is, more or less deeply seated\\n      disturbances of the cerebro-spinal system in which the sympathetic system\\n      is probably indirectly involved, as many functional disturbances presided\\n      over by the great sympathetic system often testify. Hypochondriasis, pure\\n      and simple as occurring in men, is easily distinguishable by its striking\\n      characteristic of introspection and despondency, occasioned by abnormal\\n      sensations, without marked physical weakness and tiredness. Pure\\n      hypochondriacs are often energetic, conscientious workers. In hysteria\\n      there is neither great tiredness nor tendency to introspection, but a\\n      paroxysmal or prolonged absence of the power of self control, in grave\\n      cases associated with tonic or clonic muscular spasm and loss of\\n      consciousness. While neurasthenia in its uncomplicated forms is free from\\n      these symptoms, but, as ample experience teaches, often complicated with\\n      both of the preceding forms to such an extent that it is often very\\n      difficult to tell which is primary and which secondary. The symptoms known\\n      as introspection, hysterical aberrations of the emotions, and neurasthenic\\n      sense of exhaustion are in their distinctive manifestations most important\\n      and constitute indications in the selection of remedial and dietetic\\n      measures.\\n      \\n The following are some observation of\\n      peculiarities observed in a large number of cases and peculiar to all:.\\n      \\n Introspection.-The neurasthenic patient\\n      in variably expresses her desire for relief, not so much in a direct\\n      appeal as in a supplicating, subdued tone of voice and manner. She rarely\\n      asks, \"What can you do to relieve me?\" but almost invariably,\\n      \"What is the cause of\" this or that sensation? If she is\\n      introspective, that is, hypochondriacal, she becomes a nosomaniac,\\n      watching acutely every one of her numerous distressing sensation, on the\\n      unremitting analysis of which her mind dwells. In marked cases she is\\n      quite unable to think of anything outside of herself, and in many cases\\n      dislikes to do so, preferring to river her attention on herself. Attempts\\n      to divert her annoy or anger her. Friends and relatives implore the\\n      physician to divert the patient, but all their attempts are in vain\\n      because quite misdirected.\\n      \\n Positive and Negative Will.-It seems\\n      sometimes as if the patient delights in her self-inspection, and that she\\n      prefers her condition to speedy recovery. This is not the case, for the\\n      patient will always assure the physician of her wish to get well. During\\n      the acute stage-a long yet definable period-this wish and longing cannot\\n      well be utilized, but the long and ill-defined period of convalescence\\n      must first be awaited. Here we shall always discover that the wish and the\\n      will of the patient are two very different mental conditions. The desire\\n      or wish for recovery is entirely unattended by any will effort to\\n      accomplish the desired end. The injunctions and directions of the\\n      physician are resisted by the same unconquerable power of negative power,\\n      or vis inertiae. The patient having been unable to exert her will, now\\n      thinks herself unable to use it.\\n      \\n Numerous Symptoms of Patients.-To\\n      physicians in search of indications for medicines each statement of\\n      patient concerning a sensation is apt to be considered as a symptom. Many\\n      years ago, when resolved to get at the keynote of a patient\\'s case, the\\n      writer determined to allow the patient to detail all her symptoms as long\\n      as she chose and to take accurate notes of each one till the right one\\n      should be disclosed; and this was to be done regardless of time and\\n      exertion. The patient, one who needed no urging to describe her\\n      \"symptoms,\" began in an almost inaudible voice, detailing one\\n      sensation after another with an unrivalled degree of clearness and\\n      vividness of expression; as she proceeded the voice became stronger, her\\n      face slightly flushed, and the most perfect descriptive language flowed in\\n      an endless stream. Each word was written down, page after page was filled;\\n      still she went on with unmistakable signs of satisfaction at being able to\\n      pour her pent-up emotions into willing and sympathetic ears. If, for a\\n      moment, the flow of language was interrupted, a simple question would\\n      re-animate her to proceed with renewed energy. Feelings seemed to beget\\n      feelings; their complexity gave the patient no trouble; her intellect was\\n      equal to the action of unraveling the most complicated sensation,\\n      separating them into their component parts and spreading them out before\\n      the mind of the listener. A glance at the watch showed that nearly two\\n      hours had passed, during which the feeblest of neurasthenic patients had\\n      talked incessantly. The note-book was full, the keynote was found. It was\\n      this: neurasthenic patients have innumerable sensation and exhibit no\\n      sings of fatigue after talking incessantly for nearly two hours.\\n      \\n Great Endurance of Neurasthenics.-The\\n      instance just related, which is one of many, illustrates two things. One\\n      is, that it is not the kind of sensation described but the fact that\\n      neurasthenics have innumerable sensations, that constitute the symptoms.\\n      The other thing is that many neurasthenics are capable of great exertion\\n      without suffering disagreeable after- effects from fatigue. This is\\n      illustrated by other cases of which I have notes. A highly neurasthenic\\n      young lady consented to camp out for her health near a lake. She was\\n      induced to join a party for a short walk along the lake. By trying what\\n      they thought a shorter road the party lost their way and took a very long\\n      walk of about four hours, through bogs and over forces. The neurasthenic\\n      was less fatigued than some of the others. The interesting observation was\\n      subsequently made that the patient had become interested in a young man of\\n      the party. She recovered her health within a year from that time. Other\\n      cases of this kind will appear under the head of therapeutic suggestions.\\n      \\n Neurasthenic Patients Crave\\n      Sympathy.-This is one of the most formidable obstacles to the curative\\n      management of such cases, for the kind of sympathy such patients crave is\\n      expressions of condolence and more or less deep affliction at so much\\n      suffering as the patient expresses. Such sympathy is most natural and does\\n      honor to the feelings of parents, sisters, brothers and husbands, but it\\n      is unfortunate that the deeper their expression of affliction so much the\\n      more profound will be the mental dejection and weakness of the patient.\\n      Almost every case which has come under the writer\\'s observation has been\\n      much hampered if not made hopeless by this condition of things, against\\n      which no remedy suggests itself that would not be construed as\\n      \"unkind\".\\n      \\n The origin of this very formidable and\\n      refractory nervous disease, like that of most diseases usually termed\\n      chronic, is either hereditary or acquired, as the histories of every\\n      observed case plainly testify. Either the father was a hypochondriac or\\n      the mother neurasthenic, or both parents were of unsound nervous\\n      constitution. Dipsomania on the part of parents produces neurasthenia in\\n      the children, as readily as it will be followed by any other form of\\n      nervous disease, according to the individual predisposition of the\\n      offspring. The excessive use of tea and coffee is another very active\\n      factor in the history of neurasthenics. Where fathers inclined to alcohol,\\n      mothers are addicted to tea and coffee, which, while its immediate effects\\n      do not obtrude themselves upon our notice, are none the less insidious in\\n      their more remote consequences.\\n      \\n The acquired forms of neurasthenia are\\n      of utmost interest to the therapeutist, and the sources of acquisition are\\n      readily stated. They are much brain-work with insufficient food and sleep.\\n      Such conditions obtain chiefly in women (less frequently in men) of fine\\n      intellectual ability, conscientiousness and ambition. Physical overwork\\n      with unintellectual women has no such effect. Quite analogous to the above\\n      are the conditions of care and sorrow, especially in women who are able\\n      for a long time to conceal and control their emotions. The usual\\n      consequence of such states of mind is disregard of food and insufficient\\n      sleep. Instances of acquired neurasthenia are presented in families of\\n      several girls and boys, where one or more of the former are Neurasthenic\\n      while the latter are vigorous and athletic. Boys delighting in vigorous\\n      exercise do not, as is the case with girls, lose appetite and sleep.\\n      \\n The effects of nervous exhaustion in\\n      boys are usually much less grave than in girls; as a rule such effects are\\n      manifested in mental, not muscular, tiredness, and they are relieved by\\n      air and exercise, while in girls and women those influences are shunned\\n      because they seem to increase the tiredness.\\n      \\n Predisposition-The temperament, or what\\n      in modern pharaseology is called the personal equation, plays a visible\\n      but uncontrollable part in the progress of neurasthenia, as temperament\\n      greatly determines the other imperfectly known condition known as\\n      predisposition. Where the disease is hereditary, it is easy to say that\\n      the predisposition is due to that source; where there is no history of\\n      heredity and where neurasthenia exists in the last members of a\\n      generation, it may be attributed to acquired predisposition which needed\\n      only the exciting cause to establish the disease in its most typical form.\\n      \\n One of the most common forms of\\n      neurasthenia, often quite intractable, results from a serious defect in\\n      our public school system, one which affects chiefly girls from twelve to\\n      fourteen years of age. The following is a brief example: The child rises\\n      late with no appetite for breakfast and no time to eat it if so inclined.\\n      The lessons, however, have been learned the evening before, and the school\\n      work is begun with an ambitions will and a crammed mind, and continues\\n      with one intermission of often not more than ten minutes or three of four\\n      hours. The pupil arrives at home ravenously hungry, eats too fast, and too\\n      much of injudiciously prepared food, too long in digesting to leave room\\n      for an appetite for even a light evening meal, or even for a breakfast the\\n      next morning.\\n      \\n In another case the girl or boy grows\\n      desperately hungry while at school, but being unprovided with food\\n      (lunch), goes on with the school exercises, at the end of which the sense\\n      of hunger has vanished and has been replaced by an aversion to normal\\n      food, with a possible craving for something pungent and indigestible. This\\n      observation can easily be made in many instances, and will, in as many\\n      cases, be seen to lead to nervous prostration, which is then treated by\\n      vile, patented concoctions consisting largely of whiskey, under the name\\n      of \"tonics,\" while the patient needs only the best that a\\n      legitimate market affords prepared in a sensible manner.\\n      \\n Typical Cases Ending in Rapid\\n      Recovery.-Curative results have already been indicated in what has been\\n      said above, and further indications for treatment may be gathered from a\\n      few cases of extremely rapid recovery of apparently incurable cases, to\\n      which brief allusion will here be made. A woman of forty had been a victim\\n      of grave neurasthenia for five years. In the absence of an inclination to\\n      exert himself, she had, during that period, been mostly confined to her\\n      bed or lounge, in the meantime giving birth to two children, going through\\n      gestation and confinement normally, without recovering from neurasthenic\\n      prostration which, in the course of some years more, rendered her entirely\\n      helpless. Her condition was associated with a feeling of dropping to\\n      pieces unless supported and braced by a harness of wood, iron and leather,\\n      in which she \"sat up\" for several hours each day, spending the\\n      rest of the time in bed. Having left the patient in this condition, it was\\n      reported before the writer\\'s next professional visit that Mrs.-had been\\n      cured, and that she was able to go out like other people. A visit to the\\n      house confirmed the report. The patient came to the door herself, and in a\\n      quiet manner, entirely without the least expression of joy or wonder at\\n      her release, stated, that having heard of a famous \"magnetic\\n      physician,\" she summoned him, was ordered by him to arise and stand;\\n      protesting that it was impossible, she was raised to her feet and again\\n      ordered to stand, then to walk. Fearing that she would fall, she begged\\n      the magnetic doctor to support her, which he peremptorily refused, saying\\n      she might fall if she liked. Instead of falling, she had to walk about the\\n      room, was then placed upon a lounge and subjected to a severe treatment of\\n      rolling and pummelling, and then ordered to dress and sit up until tired,\\n      to remain up and about like other people, and to call on the doctor in\\n      future, as he would not come so far to the patient again. This happened\\n      about twenty-five years ago, and the patient has been in very fair health\\n      arrested by insisting that all professional visits by the writer or any\\n      other physician to whose sympathy the patient could appeal must cease.\\n      This injunction was carried out conscientiously with the best results by\\n      the husband of the patient. Perhaps we may learn from this that sometimes,\\n      at least, the familiar motto is reversed, and angels rush in where fools\\n      fear to tread.\\n      \\n Profiting by this experience, another\\n      neurasthenic woman, unmarried, but of most intractable, antagonistic\\n      temperament, confined to her bed, in and out of hospitals, for years,\\n      wearing out the strength and means of her relatives and the patience of\\n      many physicians, was at length abandoned by them. It was a case of spinal\\n      and cerebral neurasthenia complicated with hypochondriasis in its most\\n      trying form of introspective maunderings and endless description of\\n      symptoms. She tormented her advisers by her endless tirades, the\\n      indulgence of which invariably aggravated her condition, and were there\\n      fore avoided, until once her physician yielded to the patient\\'s\\n      importunities for a visit, when be found her in her usual abject state of\\n      prostration. Guided by experience derived from cases like the one first\\n      described, he assisted the patient to her feet and marched her, will you\\n      nil you, up and down the room until he, at least, was thoroughly tired,\\n      and then departed with the promise never to do so again. The patient, on\\n      her part, made a number of her unnameable promises, but kept on her feet\\n      and let the doctors alone. Though not cured of deeply-rooted morbid mental\\n      faults, the neurasthenic phase of her condition had yielded to the change\\n      of the antagonistic element of her character from passive to very\\n      practical activity. A third very serious case of this kind occurred in the\\n      person of a girl of fifteen, of selfish character, who gradually became\\n      bed-ridden with spinal and cerebral neurasthenia, and tormented with the\\n      usual multifarious painful sensations, none of which, on the most\\n      pains-taking physical examination, resulted from demonstrable organic\\n      disease of genital or abdominal organs. The patient was most tenderly\\n      cared for by her mother, who, in the course of years, became so imbued\\n      with the idea of yielding to every wish and whim of the patient, that at\\n      length remonstrance became useless. The mother, though recognizing the\\n      importance of persuading or urging her daughter to depend more on herself,\\n      admitted that she had yielded so long that now she must continue to feed,\\n      dress and assist her charge in the most trivial things. Her food had to be\\n      placed in her mouth, the position of a hand or foot changed by some one\\n      else, although patient did so spontaneously when she chose. This went on\\n      for fifteen years, when the mother, growing old and feeble, died. Her\\n      maternal support being gone, the patient at once proved her ability to\\n      walk, to dress, to feed herself, and to seek light employment. Though far\\n      from well, she is equally far fro being a helpless, bed-ridden invalid.\\n      \\n A fourth case, still very vividly\\n      impressed on the writer\\'s mind, was one of a healthy, romping girl of 14,\\n      who, as happen in this remarkably capricious disease, in the midst of\\n      perfect health, one day took to her bed and remained there with all the\\n      symptoms of neurasthenia, involving first the spinal and finally the\\n      cerebral nerves. This patient was very amiable, conscientious, and\\n      sensible, never loquacious, and not troubled with hypochondriacal thoughts\\n      or sensations. Tiredness was the only expression she used in describing\\n      her feelings. There was literally no variation from this condition, which\\n      confined her to her bed for years, till she grew from a girl to a woman.\\n      Eating and sleeping well, and improving perceptibly in personal appearance\\n      and character, yet she lay on her couch tired and watched over with\\n      unremitting care by a most anxious mother, showing her solicitude and\\n      sympathy in every feature. Once, in the second year of the disease, a\\n      favorable interruption occurred. The mother, still a young woman, gave\\n      birth to another child. During her confinement the neurasthenic patient\\n      was in charge of her mother\\'s nurse, assisted by other servants. The\\n      nurse, while devoted to the daughter, agreed with the writer that excess\\n      of sympathy was injurious, and used her best and judicious endeavors\\n      gradually to persuade the patient to make some physical effort at walking\\n      and standing. In this she was so successful that in two weeks she\\n      accompanied the girl on half-mile walks up and down hill, finally without\\n      assistance. Thus, recovery seemed assured, and everything was favorable\\n      progressing towards it when the mother, having fully recovered, again took\\n      charge of her daughter, with the result that she at once took to her\\n      lounge and remained there two years longer. About that time other advice\\n      was urged and gladly acceded to, with the result that the case was\\n      diagnosed by an eminent surgeon as spinal paralysis in consequence of\\n      concussion, though it could never be shown when and where it occurred.\\n      Salves, plasters, anodynes, nervines, and electricity did no good, but\\n      effectually destroyed appetite and digestion, which higher to had been\\n      normal. So this adviser resigned in favor of a third, who, being a younger\\n      and less prejudiced man, agreed perfectly with the writer\\'s original\\n      opinion. He advised return to moderate exercise, avoidance of drugs, and\\n      less display of sympathy. This, though formerly rejected as\\n      \"unkind,\" was now acceded to as coming from a nerve- specialist,\\n      fresh from Europe, at that time very rare. Still attending the other\\n      members of the family, the writer had sample opportunity of observing the\\n      course of the case. Improvement was very slow and uncertain till financial\\n      misfortune overtook the family. Almost with a bound our patient left her\\n      cough, and, organizing a kindergarten, strove energetically in supporting\\n      herself and assisting her mother. The change came about in less than three\\n      weeks, and resulted in perfect recovery.\\n      \\n At this point another very instructive\\n      case of very speedy recovery, after six or seven years of neurasthenic\\n      prostration, deserves to be mentioned. A woman of 35 had been in bed and\\n      on the lounge most of the time for nearly seven years, at the end of which\\n      time she became my patient, her regular medical attendant having gone to\\n      Europe. She was of very amiable disposition and as sensitive as she was\\n      weak. Her symptoms, as in the other cases, were instantaneous exhaustion\\n      on the least physical exertion. She could give herself up to no mental\\n      occupation beyond directing her house-hold affairs, the education of her\\n      son, and the rehearsal of her numerous sensations. She had not been my\\n      patient long when her husband failed in business, so that the family was\\n      reduced from very comfortable circumstances to a condition which made it\\n      necessary for the patient to make her own living and that of the family.\\n      This she almost at once proceeded to do, setting aside all other\\n      considerations and establishing a boarding-house, where she did most of\\n      the work herself. This she has done now for ten or twelve years without a\\n      serious relapse. The time involved in the period of convalescence was\\n      scarcely more than three weeks, a although her work maybe said to have\\n      begun at the moment her resolution was taken.\\n      \\n Prognostics.-From these and other cases\\n      in and outside of the writer\\'s practice, it is safe to say that the\\n      majority of cases of neurasthenia recover, though years may elapse before\\n      that period. We learn, furthermore, that recoveries, especially of very\\n      inveterate cases, depend on conditions beyond the control of the\\n      physician, as was the case in the above-recorded instances, where\\n      circumstances forced the patient to cases to wish for recovery and to make\\n      an effort of the will. This having been once accomplished self-confidence,\\n      for a long time in abeyance, was permanently restored.\\n      \\n Curability, further, depends very much\\n      on the temperament of the patient, whether amiable, tractable and\\n      confiding in the honest endeavors of the physician, or whether refractory,\\n      suspicious, untruthful, selfish and antagonistic, of a disposition\\n      impossible to win over on account of unnatural distrust of every\\n      well-meaning person. The degree of intelligence of patients also has a\\n      pronounced influence on the result. The most readily curable cases are\\n      those acquired without hereditary predisposition, where the cause is found\\n      in the absence of food and sleep, also where sorrow and anxiety can be\\n      averted or counteracted by judicious conduct of near relatives and\\n      friends.\\n      \\n Dietetic Treatment.-This, as medicinal\\n      treatment, must be governed by the stage at which the case comes into the\\n      physician\\'s hands-whether yet in its prodromal, its acute or its chronic\\n      phase. The prodromal stage of the disease has no very decided\\n      pathognomonic signs. The most that can be recognized in this stage is that\\n      the patient\\'s habits or duties are of a kind which will eventually lead to\\n      obdurate neurasthenia if not arrested in time by removing the exciting\\n      causes. Too much pleasure, as well as too much care, especially in girls\\n      and woman, tends to neglect of food and rest, in the absence of which,\\n      excitements, whether of pleasure or care, begets a state of unrest in\\n      which repose is disagreeable. With such a condition comes a list of\\n      incipient casual complaints of headache, imperfect sleep, notional ways of\\n      eating, working or playing. A few questions will determine whether the\\n      patient is living according to normal or abnormal habits with regard to\\n      appetite, sleep and occupation. Where these are found, their alteration to\\n      normal ways must be instead on. It is unnecessary to say that this is\\n      easier said than done, for it will probably meet with serious objections\\n      on the part of the patient, if not on that of her relatives; for most\\n      likely she has examinations for college to prepare for, involving several\\n      months of dose and careful study at night, and the patient cannot waste\\n      time in sleeping and eating while cramming that little excited and\\n      ambitions brain. A failure in the examinations would be as much of a\\n      disappointment to parents as to patient, who proves, as usual, that this\\n      appellation is a misnomer. She accordingly goes in as she please, lied by\\n      an increasing morbidly ambitions impulse, and the result is likely to be\\n      the mournful satisfaction on the part of the physician of being obliged to\\n      say, \"I told you before what would happen.\" Of course, all\\n      regret the now evident nerve-prostration, while, if the doctor had\\n      succeeded in enforcing his rules, he would in many cases experience the\\n      still more painful reproach of having been too severe. Nevertheless,\\n      absolute firmness and a kindly but unflinching exertion of his will,\\n      without the least compromise, reward the physician with the best results\\n      in such cases.\\n      \\n When the case, after the stage of\\n      excitement and untiring restlessness (at which it would still be speedily\\n      curable by simple dietetic rules) has, after weeks or months, entered upon\\n      the phase of painful prostration, here we encounter backache, oppressive\\n      headache, and absolute loss of mental or bodily endurance, measures of\\n      dietetic management are much less effective and much more difficult to\\n      find. it is at this stage that slight rise of temperature will occur,\\n      especially towards evening; then the backache and headache disappear, the\\n      pallor is replaced by a flush of color, the eyes lose their listless look,\\n      and the patient is inclined to enter upon some diversion or excitement,\\n      followed by a restless night and a morning of exhaustion and a renewal of\\n      all painful sensations. Most of such patients feel much better in the\\n      evening when they are ready for some entertainment, while in a normal\\n      state this would be the time for relaxation and repose.\\n      \\n The dietetic treatment of this stage is\\n      methodical rest. In severe cases the patient will do well to remain in bed\\n      for several days or even for weeks. It is well to shorten this period as\\n      much as possible and to insist on walking about, or, at least. sitting for\\n      a specified time every day. This may be varied b equally specified periods\\n      of rest in the recumbent position.\\n      \\n Irregularities of eating are at this\\n      and at all times to be superseded by the most rigid regularity of meals.\\n      The traditional and conventional three-meal system, however well adapted\\n      to the needs of a vigorous man or woman, does not agree with the\\n      neurasthenic patient. It is much better that these should eat oftener;\\n      four times a day is best in most cases, for the simple reason that in this\\n      way a patient, while eating less at a time, consumes more food in the\\n      aggregate.\\n      \\n As neurasthenic patients are rarely\\n      troubled with absolute aversion to wholesome food, they are generally able\\n      to consume a liberal quantity, about which it is only needful to remark\\n      here that the food should be selected from among the articles and dishes\\n      which the patient likes, provided they belong to the order of good, normal\\n      articles of food, to the exclusion of those which simply please the taste\\n      without being digestible. A dish entirely of meat or \"animal\\n      food\" is as far from being a good diet for neurasthenics as one\\n      consisting entirely of \"vegetable\" food. As a rule, the diet\\n      list should comprise one-third of nitrogenous material and two-thirds of\\n      carbohydrates. Together with these, it is a great mistake to neglect the\\n      fats, such as good butter and the fats of meats. And, lastly, every\\n      patient of this kind should be made to drink some water often, a dietetic\\n      feature too often neglected.\\n      \\n During this stage, actually fatiguing\\n      exercise of body and mind should be avoided, while, on the other hand, the\\n      patient\\'s mind should be directed away from herself, in which she is much\\n      assisted by withholding a certain kind of emotional sympathy, quite as\\n      natural as it is difficult to repress on the part of affectionate persons.\\n      Of this, a few words further on.\\n      \\n There is no definite time for the\\n      duration of this stage, which, however, depends largely on the time during\\n      which the exciting causes have acted, either aided by or without a\\n      predisposition. It is certain, however, that the sooner it is recognized\\n      and the exciting causes eliminated, so much the sooner recovery will\\n      begin. But there is a stage at which the best of experience and judgment\\n      often fail, especially in very inveterate cases. If the case is one of a\\n      patient whom the physician has had opportunity of watching at least since\\n      the earlier stages, the difficulty is not so great as it is in old cases\\n      months or even of several years\\' duration which come to treatment late. In\\n      these, the line between the intermediate stage and incipient convalescence\\n      cannot be drawn. The patient is as neurasthenic and hypochondriacal as\\n      ever; cannot bear the slightest mental or bodily exertion, not even a word\\n      or a look, without sings of apparent exhaustion, while nearly the whole\\n      time is spent in bed under anxious care of sympathetic attendants. In such\\n      cases, having become assured, by careful physical examination, of the\\n      absence of organic disease, seeing the patient generally well nourished\\n      and in fair muscular condition, the physician is warranted in assuming\\n      that the disease has run its course, that whatever morbid (pathological)\\n      process there may have been progressing in the nervous system, this\\n      process has now come to and end, but it has left the patient\\'s mental\\n      condition habituated to the moods of the past months or years, and fixed,\\n      as it were, indelibly in the memory. It is the habit that now remains, not\\n      the disease.\\n      \\n If reasonably sure of this, and calling\\n      to mind the rapid recoveries and the circumstances attending them, as\\n      above detailed, the physician is now safe in ordering a more energetic\\n      treatment, calculated to rouse the self-reliance of the patient. All\\n      visible signs of sympathy must now be set aside; the actins and demeanor\\n      of the attendants should, from this time, if not before, be changed so as\\n      to give the patient the impression that she is no longer an invalid, but\\n      expected to rely on her own exertion. Instead of being fed, the food\\n      should be placed where she must go for and eat it. She should now be\\n      expected to dress and attend, without assistance, to her natural wants.\\n      This, with some temperaments, is almost impossible, with al extremely\\n      difficult. The best course to pursue is to remove such patients from\\n      sympathetic relatives or friends, and to place them in charge of kind,\\n      reliable, but eminently practical nurses.\\n      \\n The first effect of this is either to\\n      throw the patient into a stage of helpless despondency, which, again\\n      appealing powerfully to the sympathies of those nearest to her, often\\n      frustrates the physician\\'s plans which, if firmly but kindly adhered to,\\n      would, ere long, prove of their superiority by signs of returning\\n      self-reliance and absence of complaints on the part of the patient. A\\n      second form of effect is that occurring in patients of obstreperous,\\n      selfish disposition, whose opposition and even anger is aroused by being\\n      thrown on their own resources after the removal of depressing and\\n      unpractical sympathy. This opposition or temper, often manifested in all\\n      sorts of intrigues and subterfuges on the part of the patient, if not\\n      supinely yielded to by sympathetic persons, will finally be replaced by a\\n      more rational disposition. On the whole, anger or active opposition are\\n      signs of returning energy, which, once coming to the consciousness of the\\n      patient, takes the form of self- reliance. it is this way that the cures\\n      of chronic cases above related can be explained, and physicians should\\n      profit by such experience for the benefit of their patients.\\n      \\n The general dietetic management now\\n      readily follows from what has been said, and needs only a few general\\n      modifications. The first duty of the physician will be to test the degree\\n      of reliance to be placed on the patient and her friends, ad to win them\\n      over if possible to his plans, and his success will be in proportion to\\n      the degree of confidence he is able to inspire. This personal confidence\\n      should not degenerate into a mere personal liking or attachment of a\\n      sympathy-craving neurasthenic who should discover henceforth that all\\n      sentimental expressing of sympathy are about to take a practical form,\\n      aiming at a definite result-the patient\\'s health-which she wishes but\\n      cannot exert her will to attain. The best and often the only way to do\\n      away with sentiment and to reach practical kindness is to remove the\\n      patient from certain home influence, and to place her in a hospital or\\n      elsewhere under the management of competent nurses who, without being\\n      selfish, know how to exert a certain amount of wholesome push as fast as\\n      the patient can bear it. Without the removal of sentimental sympathy, all\\n      efforts at counteracting the purely hypochondriacal side of neurasthenia\\n      are useless.\\n      \\n In these cases of neurasthenia as yet\\n      uncomplicated with the hypochondriacal element of introspective nosomania,\\n      there is only one unconditional rule to be followed, especially in\\n      acquired cases whose evident cause was incessant, conscientious work of\\n      mind and body, together with insufficient food and sleep. Such cases come\\n      on very insidiously, the loss of strength-that is, the actual waste of\\n      nerve-substance-being just a trifle grater than the quantity restored, the\\n      patient unconsciously using up a minute part of her capital every day.\\n      Here the rule should be to reverse matters to insuring a supply of\\n      nourishment and time for its assimilation greater than was the case\\n      heretofore. The case of young school-girls belong in this class. The time\\n      of food and rest should be carefully controlled at home, the duty of the\\n      physician being to educate indifferent and ignorant parents up to an\\n      appreciation of the nature of the case. It is generally not difficult to\\n      open their eyes through the medium of their anxiety concerning their\\n      children\\'s health. Having thus insured sufficient rest and food at home,\\n      the physician\\'s next object of attention should be the regulations of the\\n      school. Here is the point where teachers have an opportunity of exerting\\n      their most practical influence. It should be made obligatory on the part\\n      of teachers to institute inquiry as to whether pupils have had their meals\\n      before coming to school. This they could often ascertain without a\\n      question, by reading the pupil\\'s condition in her emaciated form, pale\\n      face and nervous manner. To guard against neglect at home, it would be an\\n      easy matter to insist that all pupils of public and private schools should\\n      bring with them some proper food. The few who do so generally bring\\n      sweets-an apple, orange or a few dry crackers-when a piece of good bread\\n      and slice of cold meat would be what they actually need. All pupils should\\n      pass inspection, and if remiss in this important particular, the\\n      delinquent should be dismissed with several marks against her. To expect\\n      this of teachers would be a great advance in the place of futile\\n      innovations of endeavoring to send forth from our common schools graduates\\n      in arts and sciences.\\n      \\n Sudden Effects.-A large number of cases\\n      of neurasthenia, especially those complicated with inveterate\\n      Hypochondriasis, are frequently traced to some sudden occurrence, having\\n      the effect of a mental or physical shock. In one patient, a vigorous girl,\\n      used to romping, climbing and running lie a boy, the cause was supposed to\\n      be a slight thump she received during a game of blindman\\'s-buff. She\\n      thought nothing of it at the time, but it was suggested long after the\\n      patient\\'s illness began. In another case some mental shock of joy or\\n      grief, not very severe and such as is often experienced in every person\\'s\\n      life, is the beginning of months of nervous prostration.\\n      \\n There is quite an array of evidence\\n      that neurasthenia which has entered upon a hypochondriacal stage or\\n      complication with or without a strong hysterical admixture, is curable by\\n      sudden impressions in the form of a shock, or more gradually by frequent\\n      repetitions of an impression. Such cases, as I have shown above, occur\\n      most commonly in the stage when what may be considered the essential\\n      pathological disturbances of function have run their course and have left\\n      the patient in a state of mental disturbance which indicated that the\\n      patient\\'s recovery depends entirely upon her volition. But there is none,\\n      and so far nothing has succeeded in arousing it. Persuasion is as useless\\n      and irritating, as argument would be in a case of insanity with a fixed\\n      illusion. The resemblance between this and the state of mind of a\\n      hypochondriacal neurasthenic is very close. She cannot move nor thick.\\n      Exhaustion overcomes her and keeps her its victim for years, when suddenly\\n      the scene changes, and a few days or weeks suffice to restore the patient\\n      to activity. In one instance it is attributed to medical, in another to\\n      \"mind cure,\" in a third to \"Christian science;\" in\\n      still other cases massage has done it, in others again \"magnetic\\n      influence,\" in others the very powerful factor necessity. It is\\n      certain that cases of this kind, produced by sudden effects on the mind of\\n      a predisposed person, are also cured by such effects. Whatever the visible\\n      form of these effects may be -whether that of \"Christian\\n      science,\" joy, grief or absolute inexorable necessity, there is\\n      always to be noticed a certain force and condition involving the modern\\n      idea of suggestion, which comes to the patient in an irresistible degree\\n      and now sets the function of the will in motion again.\\n      \\n Experience teaches that it is by no\\n      means a matter of indifference which of these forms of effect are brought\\n      into action. In one case it is the professional Christian scientist\\'s\\n      method, in another the almost brutal exertion of a person\\'s will combined\\n      with some physical force. In either case the patient is aroused from his\\n      inertia, and discovers his powers of mental and bodily ability to act.\\n      \\n A deplorable result is that recoveries\\n      after such effects are attributed in the popular mind to supernatural\\n      causes. That such is not the case may be gathered form instances occurring\\n      in very sensible and intelligent patients, whose reason is scarcely ever\\n      so far disturbed and weakened that they do not resent the proposition of\\n      trying, e.g., Christian science or mind cure.\\n      \\n Nevertheless, it is the mind cure which\\n      the intelligent patient needs quite as much as the ignorant and\\n      superstitious person; the difference is only the form in which the\\n      influencing force is applied. While in one case it is obedience to the\\n      candidly expressed instructions of the physician, in the other case the\\n      result is the to mystification. In either case it is the powerful stimulus\\n      of hope and aroused confidence that recovery will be realized.\\n      \\n The definition of suggestion does not\\n      fully cover the meaning, because the influence employed is greater than\\n      mere suggestion. The physician\\'s plan of action should be straightforward\\n      assurance of recovery, a direct appeal to hope, and an unceasing endeavor\\n      to arouse the self-reliance of the patient, not so much by verbal\\n      exhortations as by a manner and department from which the patient learns\\n      more readily than from words what is expected. If the attitude of the\\n      physician is appreciated, and seconded by the relatives and attendants, a\\n      favorable result is much more certain to follow.\\n      \\n Hypnotism is not advisable. There are\\n      now existing ancient neurasthenic invalids dating from the times of\\n      spiritualism when they were famous \"mediums.\" Hypnotism weakness\\n      the will and nervous endurance, and produces a predisposition to emotional\\n      nervousness with an intractable erotic admixture. The suggestions sought\\n      to be instilled into a hypnotized patient amount to nothing. The mental\\n      influence of mystical treatment administered while the patients is awake\\n      is much more powerful in awaking hope and confidence than the uncertain\\n      effects of an abnormal state like that of hypnotism. Mystification, again,\\n      though sometimes unavoidable with the best intention, is less powerful\\n      than direct and intelligible encouragement. While resort to mystification\\n      should be shunned by reputable physicians, the question arises as to what\\n      shall be done with the many who, from lack of intelligence or education,\\n      are entirely beyond the reach of honest common sense, and who will persist\\n      in mystifying themselves, who remain neurasthenic invalids in spite of the\\n      best regulations of the physician, and who do not recover unless their\\n      encouragement follows some mystical formalities which alone arouse their\\n      \"faith\" and finally their confidence and will-power. For the\\n      present there is no way out of the dilemma but to submit such patients to\\n      the suggestive methods of what is popularly known as mind cure and\\n      Christian science. In doing so, physicians should use their influence as\\n      far as possible in selecting the most honest persons of this class.\\n      \\n DISCUSSION.\\n      \\n JAMES C. WOOD, M.D.: I have nothing but\\n      words of praise for Dr. Wesselhoeft\\'s excellent paper. It is very evident\\n      that the author\\'s inspiration came not from books but from actual contact\\n      with neurasthenic subjects, for the impress of originality is most\\n      conspicuous. It is a production which could only come from one of\\n      experience and from a reasoner. I consider it a most valuable contribution\\n      to the literature of that now most interesting subject,\\n      \"neurasthenia\".\\n      \\n The doctor, in his paper, has sometimes\\n      used the term \"neurasthenia\" instead of\\n      \"neurasthenia.\" The first of these means, according to Thomas,\\n      great nervous power or excitement; the second, nervous debility. I taken\\n      it from the context that the subject dealt with is neurasthenia. To the\\n      average mind there exists what seems to me a needless confusion regarding\\n      the terms, nervous prostration, hysteria and hystero-neurosis. As I\\n      understand these terms they define distinct conditions, though there is a\\n      frequent blending the one with the other. The term nervous prostration,\\n      which is a synonym of neurasthenia, defines itself; the term hysteria\\n      should be restricted to those general neuroses characterized particularly\\n      by psychical manifestations, though not infrequently by motor, sensory,\\n      secretory, vasomotor and reflex derangements as well; while the term\\n      hysteroneurosis implies the uterine origin of symptoms manifesting\\n      themselves in organs remote from the uterus without structural changes in\\n      such organs, being the direct result of reflex nervous influence starting\\n      from the uterus. The last term does not occur in the paper under\\n      discussion. From the standpoint of a gynecologist I think that this is\\n      misleading.\\n      \\n Let us see why and how it is that these\\n      three conditions (I will not call them diseases) are so frequently\\n      associated. I think that all will admit the frequent occurrence in woman\\n      of reflex symptoms, the result of pelvic lesions. An irritation staring\\n      form the pelvis is conveyed to the genito-spinal centre, thence to any or\\n      all organs with which this centre communicates. The organ oftener involved\\n      than any other is the stomach. This is shown by the frequent occurrence of\\n      nausea and vomiting following conception. The nervous system may have been\\n      previously involved, but oftener it becomes so only after the nutrition is\\n      depraved, which, sooner or later, occurs if the pelvic lesion is not\\n      removed. The depraved blood fails to supply the nerve centres with that\\n      which they need to sustain them, and they become anaemic. Prostration is\\n      but a subjective manifestation of the anaemia, and it varies in degree\\n      from a slight indisposition to the most abject helplessness.\\n      \\n If, then, nervous prostration may have\\n      its beginning in a pelvic lesion, is it possible for a pelvic lesion to be\\n      inaugurated by systemic disturbances? Personally, I believe that it is,\\n      and offer this explanation as the modus operandi by which such a lesion is\\n      induced: Marked circulatory changes nearly always attend nervous\\n      prostration. The circulation is presided over by the vaso-motor system,\\n      and wear and repair depend upon the proper regulation of this system. If\\n      it becomes disturbed, the bloodvessels dilate or contract unduly, with\\n      resulting local hyperaemia or local anaemia, as the case maybe. The\\n      climacteric flushes are the result of such disturbance. The alternate\\n      coldness and heat of the extremities, so often associated with rectal and\\n      uterine lesions, is another familiar illustration. If the brain is\\n      involved, either insomnia or drowsiness occur, depending upon whether the\\n      brain is anaemic or hyperaemic. Flatulence, gastralgia, and nervous\\n      dyspepsia result when the stomach is similarly affected. The womb and the\\n      ovaries, because of the periodical congestion imposed upon them, are\\n      oftener implicated by these unnatural circulatory disturbances than any of\\n      the pelvic organs, and in time also become unduly hyperaemic or anaemic,\\n      as the case may be.\\n      \\n It will thus be seen that nervous\\n      prostration may exist independently of pelvic lesions, or, conversely,\\n      pelvic lesions may exist independently of nervous prostration.\\n      Nevertheless, the two are frequently associated, and this fact ought, I\\n      believe, to be kept in mind in dealing with the affection known as\\n      neurasthenia. Hysterical manifestations nearly always come to the surface\\n      in nervous prostration, and they also frequently attend pelvic lesions.\\n      Indeed, the term \"hystero-psychosis\" has been coined for the\\n      purpose of defining certain psychical disturbances of presumably pelvic\\n      origin, and in the broadest sense neurasthenia is not uncommonly an\\n      hysteroneurosis. It is the frequent association of these three conditions\\n      which, it seems to me, makes it more practicable to study them conjointly.\\n      \\n The special symptoms of nervous\\n      prostration are most variable. Introspection, as Dr. Wesselhoeft has\\n      pointed out, makes of the patient a nosomaniac. The anaemic nerve centres\\n      are unduly impressionable, and a mental shock which would not seriously\\n      affect a stronger and more rugged woman falls with crushing force upon one\\n      whose nutrition is already depraved. In this way are developed disorders\\n      of sensibility, alternations of mobility, circulatory disturbances,\\n      anomalies of secretion and exertion, disorders of the gastro-intestinal\\n      canal, dermatoses, and general and psychical disturbances of all kinds.\\n      Many of these affections start from pelvic lesions, and are nearly always\\n      associated with depravity of nutrition and more or less nervous\\n      prostration.\\n      \\n Some of the worst symptoms of\\n      neurasthenia with which I have had to contend have been hyperaesthesia of\\n      the articulations, giving rise to the so-called \"hysterical\\n      joint.\" Here the prostration is usually not profound, and it is\\n      possible to apply the somewhat energetic treatment recommended by Dr.\\n      Wesselhoeft. I remember one case very distinctly, the detailed history of\\n      which I shall give in another place, which brought me much reputation\\n      because of the \"remarkable\" cure I was fortunate enough to make.\\n      \\n The patient, a beautiful girl of\\n      eighteen, had been bed- ridden for three years with supposed hip-joint\\n      disease. She was in college before assuming the ride of an invalid, and\\n      worried much over her studies and work. She sustained a fall a short time\\n      previously to taking to her bed, and to this fall the injury to the hip\\n      was attributed. She had been from physician to physician and from\\n      sanitarium to sanitarium without receiving benefit. All of the numerous\\n      medical men under whose care she had been, directed their attention to the\\n      hip and applied the classical treatment for morbus coxarius without avail.\\n      The patient had finally reached a point where introspection was her chief\\n      occupation and her mind dwelt almost continually upon a \"diseased\\n      hip.\" She was finally brought to me, coming in an invalid\\'s chair and\\n      looking the very picture of dependency. There was a slight degree of\\n      anaemia, though this was not marked. Notwithstanding the expression\\n      expression of abjectness the girl did not look seriously ill. The hip was\\n      excessively tender upon pressure, but there was no local increase of\\n      temperature, no evidences of fever and suppuration, and forcible\\n      apposition by striking the heel was not very painful. More less spastic\\n      contraction of the flexor muscles of the affected side existed, which gave\\n      to the limb an appearance of actual shortening, which was very deceptive.\\n      Hysterical symptoms were common. On examination I found the left ovary\\n      exquisitely tender. Compression of the ovary increased the pain in the hip\\n      most decidedly and gave rise to much nervous agitation. I did not,\\n      therefore, deem it wise to recommend local treatment other than the daily\\n      use of the hot douche. She had long been a victim of ovarian\\n      dysmenorrhoea. I placed upon the ankle of the affected limb three pounds\\n      of bar-lead, prescribed a pair of crutches and insisted upon her walking.\\n      The lead was used to overcome the spastic contraction as well as for its\\n      moral effect. I did not deem the joint lesion of such a character as to\\n      used extension. In two months\\' time this patient discarded her crutches\\n      for a cane. Six weeks later she put up the cane and is now perfectly well.\\n      \\n This was a case in which somewhat harsh\\n      measures were eminently appropriate.\\n      \\n In marked contrast to the case just\\n      recorded is the following: Mrs.-, aet. 47, widow for twenty years. She is\\n      a devoted church-woman, and for years was a leader in all charitable work\\n      done in the community in which she resided. Through friends she was urged\\n      to consult me, and I think that the call to the neighboring town in which\\n      she lived was countermanded at least four or five times before the finally\\n      mustered up courage and strength enough to see me. Upon reaching the\\n      bedside I found my patient in a room made dark by closed blinds, over\\n      which were hung heavy blankets to shut out every ray of light. The mirror\\n      was turned toward the wall for fear a ray of light might strike it and\\n      flesh throughout the darkened room. Nor did the patient rest under these\\n      extreme precautions, for the eyes were protected with two pairs of colored\\n      glasses with side attachments. Hyperaesthesia of the sense of hearing was\\n      equally marked and the noise was excluded from the room by double doors\\n      whose keyholes were stuffed with cotton. She l so had her ears filled with\\n      cotton, over which she wore ear-mufflers. She was emaciated to an extreme\\n      degree, and had been reduced to her miserable condition by a series of\\n      events which frequently precede profound neurasthenia. Her husband was\\n      killed during the war, and she was left childless. Twelve months previous\\n      to taking to her bed she nursed her mother through a long and fatal\\n      illness. This greatly prostrated her, yet she kept up until a favorite\\n      brother-in-law was thrown from a carriage and killed. This was the last\\n      straw, and the shock compelled her to take to her bed. In due time loss of\\n      appetite with irritability of the stomach developed, which, of course, led\\n      to marked depravity of nutrition. With the anaemia came hyperaesthesia of\\n      the special senses, spinal irritation, headache, hysterical\\n      manifestations, etc. There was no series pelvic lesion, although she had\\n      been much treated for an alleged uterine displacement with congestion.\\n      Unfortunately, she was encouraged, instead of discouraged, in her\\n      invalidism, and she soon became a nosomaniac of the worst type. She had\\n      written down her symptoms one at a time, and the record is such a typical\\n      one that I should like to give it in full, but time forbids.\\n      \\n With great difficulty the patient was\\n      moved on a cough to a private hospital and placed under the Weir Mitchell\\n      treatment. I ignored the pelvic trouble entirely. It is unnecessary to\\n      give in detail the progress of the case from day to day after this\\n      treatment was inaugurated. Suffice it to say that the improvement was of\\n      the most marked character, and in six weeks from the time she entered the\\n      hospital she walked to her carriage with her eyes and ears unprotected.\\n      She soon resumed her church and charitable work, in which she again takes\\n      much delight.\\n      \\n This woman wanted to get well. She was\\n      a woman of pure motives and high ideals. She had, in the language of Dr.\\n      Wesselhoeft, the wish, but, unaided, not the will. She required the aid of\\n      an intelligent, strong-minded, nurse who could bring to her exercise\\n      applied in such a way as to enable her to assimilate food without the\\n      expenditure of nerve force. She co- operated with her physician and nurse\\n      in every possible way, and as soon as the anaemic nerve cells became\\n      flushed with new blood she began to improve. To have commanded this\\n      patient \"to take up her bed and walk\" before improving her\\n      nutrition would have been as unscientific as to have placed the first\\n      patient in bed with extension and counter-extension applied to the limb. I\\n      know of no class of cases requiring for their successful treatment more\\n      tact and discrimination than that under consideration.\\n      \\n I feel confident that I have many times\\n      cut the affection short in its prodromal stage by removing the girl from\\n      college work and insisting upon open-air exercise. Static electricity has,\\n      in my hands, proved exceedingly useful both during the prodromal stage and\\n      that of convalescence.\\n      \\n I will conclude by saying that I have\\n      been impressed with the frequency with which an hereditary history of\\n      epilepsy has been met with in the cases of neurasthenia passing under my\\n      observation.'\n",
      " 'Tresorie - SOME OF THE DISEASES PREVENTING AND COMPLICATION PREGNANCY\\n[Diseases Preventing & Complicating Pregnancy]\\n\\n STERILITY.-DeSinety, Treub, Furbinger,\\n      et al., attribute 50 per cent. of unproductive marriages to the husbands,\\n      saying that sterility in the male is more often the cause of barren\\n      marriages than is generally supposed.\\n      \\n This cause of sterility I pass by, as\\n      also sterility due to mechanical obstruction, incomplete ovulation and the\\n      numerous other causes of this condition, too manifold for mere\\n      enumeration, to consider obesity as a causative agent in this condition. I\\n      need not say that the advocates for surgical interference for the relief\\n      of this condition are legion. Sims makes the assertion that sterility can\\n      be cured by surgical means only. That, of course, is Allopathic arguing\\n      pure and simple. Cases requiring surgical interference do arise, but any\\n      treatment which raises the nutrition of the entire organism, improves the\\n      blood-formation, and favors the resorption of pathological products in the\\n      sexual organs, is to be regarded as the indicated remedy.\\n      \\n Published statements are my authority\\n      for saying that excellent results have followed the administration of\\n      drugs, nevertheless; and in complete defiance of all therapeutic measures,\\n      a certain percentage of women remain barren; for with the more occult\\n      causes of sterility we remain, as yet, unacquainted, consequently they\\n      cannot all be reached with say kind of treatment whatever.\\n      \\n The following case I report somewhat in\\n      detail. Whilst not an exceptional case at all, it bears directly upon the\\n      subject under consideration, and possesses, it seems to me, some decidedly\\n      interesting features. My object in selecting this particular one is to\\n      call attention, if possible, to a condition not sufficiently considered.\\n      Mrs. J., aet. 26, married about two years and a half, appealed to my\\n      knowledge for a reason as to why she remained childless. The lady was\\n      carrying an excess of flesh, being under the medium height, and weighing\\n      186 pounds, but appeared to be in good health; family and previous history\\n      all that could be desired. Examination showed none of the common causes of\\n      sterility; neither, so far as I could ascertain, was the husband\\n      responsible for this unproductive condition of affairs. Some previous\\n      experiences of my own, with the added testimony of other and able men, was\\n      my reason for charging this condition of things to the excess of flesh,\\n      this, by the husband, being laughingly charged to excess of laziness.\\n      \\n We all, undoubtedly, are familiar with\\n      that peculiar disease of the blood-corpuscles which, whilst producing\\n      flesh, relaxes at the same time the muscular force; acting also, I\\n      believe, upon the muscular fibres of the uterus and upon the ovaries,\\n      inducing not only serious menstrual disorders but sterility. McKee,\\n      Philbert, and others give several instances of sterility chargeable to\\n      obesity, the women in question having been married several years without\\n      bearing children, and all became mothers after losing a portion of their\\n      flesh. If any other argument were needed in support of this theory we\\n      might turn to the quadrupeds, where we find the poorest breeders among the\\n      fleshiest animals. Fournel has a very able treatise on \"The Effects\\n      of Obesity on the Menstrual Functions and Parturition.\" Without\\n      having had any actual case of this description to deal with, he inclines\\n      very strongly towards the belief that obesity favors sterility. In the\\n      treatment of the case before mentioned, the patient was subjected to a\\n      daily massage of the entire body, with a special pelvic massage three\\n      times a week. This, in the main, consists in elevating the uterus as high\\n      as possible with the finger in the vagina, ending with a quick and decided\\n      vibratory motion. The diet received particular attention, as at this time\\n      there was a slight gastric ailment. The indicated remedy, Thuja, was given\\n      in the minimum dose. At the end of three months almost thirty pounds of\\n      flesh was gone, a considerable reduction. As an experiment, I recommended\\n      coitus in the knee-elbow position, advising that the lady remain quiet as\\n      long as possible after coition, with thighs well flexed. She became\\n      enciente, but miscarried at eight weeks. There was, comparatively\\n      speaking, but little pain and not much subsequent haemorrhage. She made a\\n      rapid recovery. Since then a living child has been born to them.\\n      \\n I believe I am safe in saying that this\\n      result would hardly have obtained were it not for the prophylactic\\n      measures adopted.\\n      \\n At the end of the first two months the\\n      patient was attacked with haemorrhage. A similar occurrence took place at\\n      irregular intervals during the following five months, the quantity of\\n      blood lost being much greater than that at the normal menstrual period.\\n      \\n For the greater part of the last five\\n      months she kept her bed, at the end of which time the tendency of the\\n      uterus to empty itself could be resisted no longer. A seven months\\' child\\n      was born, and is to-day doing well.\\n      \\n Pseudocyesis cerebral pregnancy,\\n      phantom pregnancy (whatever name we may call it by) is a disease which\\n      must come under the head of those \"complicating pregnancy.\" Mrs.\\n      M., a lady, married two or three years, aet. 29. Previous history good,\\n      always enjoying perfect health. When I first saw the lady in question she\\n      was a perfect picture of health, and, according to appearance and her own\\n      statements, about seven months pregnant. I made no examination. This\\n      appeared to be a thoroughly intelligent woman, and, according to her own\\n      statement, there was cessation of the menses. There certainly was an\\n      enlargement of the abdomen and breasts, a milky secretion, and the lady\\n      was sure that she felt foetal movement. On February 28th of the present\\n      year I was called to attend her in labor. Examination showed that no\\n      pregnancy existed. So far as I could ascertain there was no assignable\\n      origin for this condition other than nervous influences, the phenomena\\n      being purely muscular distension of the abdomen.\\n      \\n Mayham reports a case of a woman 73\\n      years old, claiming to be pregnant; he also claims that subsequently she\\n      was delivered of a child; this is an Allopathic report, however, of which\\n      we will take a Homoeopathic dose. Haultain reports three cases of cerebral\\n      pregnancy. In the first, he says no cause whatever was to be found; in the\\n      second, there was a small fibroid growth in the anterior uterine wall.\\n      Hauck reports a case where the vomiting, peristalsis, and flatus, caused\\n      by alcoholism were supposed to be caused by the pregnant state. Such cases\\n      are uncommon, but they emphasize the importance of making a thorough\\n      examination, in all cases where positive information is desired of the\\n      existence or non-existence of pregnancy.\\n      \\n Hyperemesis Gravidarum.-An animated\\n      discussion, held recently between two celebrated Allopaths of Stuttgart\\n      and Leipsic, has served to awaken a renewed interest in this subject,\\n      without in the least adding anything new to our stock of knowledge\\n      regarding its aetiology. Notwithstanding the frequency of the vomiting of\\n      pregnancy, its very distressing character in many instances, and its\\n      imminent, its very distressing character in many instances, and its\\n      imminent danger, we find but very few contributions of any value, to\\n      either the aetiology of the disorder or its therapeutics. I do not expect\\n      to add anything specially new myself, but it does seem to me that our\\n      knowledge of the vomiting of pregnancy, is to say the least, in a most\\n      contradictory state. Some physicians look upon it as a trifling matter,\\n      others as a thing to be endured, and some-these are in the right too-view\\n      even the mildest cases with gravity. Even in the mildest cases of morning\\n      sickness there is a constant drain upon the nervous system, putting the\\n      sufferer into a condition, in which she is very much less able to endure\\n      parturition than she would otherwise have been.\\n      \\n Dr. Harrison Mettler says: \"After\\n      careful inquiry I find that women who suffer from much morning sickness\\n      have as a rule, tedious or otherwise troublesome labors. I have observed\\n      in multiparae that at one time they will have much nausea and vomiting\\n      followed by a difficult labor, while at another time they will be quite\\n      free from the vomiting, and will pass through the succeeding labor with\\n      comparative ease.\" I must say my observations make me agree with Dr.\\n      Mettler entirely; when one thinks how rapidly the mildest of cases assume\\n      pernicious forms, indifference is certainly no longer to be excused. There\\n      is a voluminous literature upon this subject, and many and varied are the\\n      aetiological reasons given for this very variable affection, a large\\n      majority of writers coinciding in the opinion that \"many causes\\n      operate together,\" to produce what we are pleased to designate the\\n      \"vomiting of pregnancy.\" I believe myself that in a large\\n      percentage of cases, this pernicious vomiting is simply the result of a\\n      reflex neurosis. Undoubtedly uterine displacements frequently cause\\n      vomiting; but when this is so, and the displaced organ is raised by\\n      packing the vagina with aseptic wool, the vomiting ceases.\\n      \\n Lillie reports a number of cases, where\\n      obstinate vomiting was caused by a retroflexed uterus, and restoration of\\n      the organ caused a cessation of the disorder. Bezugloff having a\\n      persistent case of morning sickness, introduced a bougie it no the uterus,\\n      the intention being to produce abortion; the immediate result was a\\n      stoppage of the vomiting, and the pregnancy went on to full term.\\n      \\n In the case just cited, I must say that\\n      I believe it was the fright, caused by the thought of abortion being\\n      performed, more than the effects of introducing the bougie, which operated\\n      so successfully; I say now, as I said before, I believe that the\\n      pre-eminent cause of this kind of sickness must be looked for i the\\n      nervous system. Flint speaks of this form of sickness as being decidedly\\n      neurotic in its origin, and cites a number of cases of a chronic variety\\n      of dyspepsia frequently occurring in young girls. I had one such case come\\n      under my personal care. There was a persistent morning sickness, with this\\n      young lady, and a disagreeable nausea whenever food was taken; this\\n      patient was at some distance from her home, in a boarding school, and she\\n      will probably never know that the lady principal entertained very grave\\n      thoughts at one time in regard to her virtue. It certainly was very\\n      difficult to differentiate between this and the vomiting of pregnancy; it\\n      was, however, simply due to a vitiated nervous system. My theory is\\n      supported by Alt, who records a number of such cases; I cite one only, the\\n      case being that of a highly hysterical woman, six months pregnant,\\n      suffering from the gravest vomiting, and anxious that miscarriage be\\n      induced. She was making preparation for entering the hospital for this\\n      purpose, when one of her children was seized with pneumonia. The anxiety\\n      felt over the child, forced all thought of self from the mother\\'s mind;\\n      from that moment the vomiting ceased and she remained well until the\\n      termination of pregnancy.-Minchener Medicinische Wochenschrift.\\n      \\n Whilst saying that I believe this\\n      disease to be in the majority of cases of purely nervous origin, I would\\n      not imply thereby that it is not to be feared, far from it; if neglected,\\n      we know how likely it is to pass quickly beyond treatment and our patient\\n      succumb from sheer exhaustion.\\n      \\n In the treatment cited such as\\n      insertion of bougies, dilation of the os, pelvic massage, etc., I believe\\n      it is merely the \"doing something,\" no matter much what it is,\\n      so long as you have gained the confidence of your patient, that does good.\\n      We have seen how suddenly Hyperemesis will cease if the patient be\\n      alarmed; it may be, has often been, and will to again, cured by a process\\n      skin to suggestion. Kattenback had a case where the patient, a primipara,\\n      was seized with an incorrigible vomiting. It was suggested to her that her\\n      stomach contained some lumps of unwholesome material and their removal\\n      would cure her. Some milk was given her, and the stomach ceremoniously\\n      washed out. its contents bore no indications of either over-acidity or\\n      abnormal ferment She was informed that she was all right and the vomiting\\n      would not return; neither did if, and she was safely delivered at term.\\n      \\n There is a familiar and now well-know\\n      phenomena, by which these neurotics can be influenced; I speak of\\n      hypnotism; it is due to purely subjective conditions.\\n      \\n There is an identity of the hypnotic\\n      susceptibility with the condition of hysteria, and it is along these lines\\n      that we can work.

It must recognize too, that\\n      the sick individual has to take an active part in his treatment and not be\\n      merely the passive recipient of this or that treatment. For just as it is\\n      rightly said that man does not live by alone, so should it be emphasized\\n      that man cannot be cured by medicine alone. He must see to it himself that\\n      he lives as far as possible a physically and psychically healthy life.\\n      Indeed, each individual has a power within himself to help in his own\\n      cure.\\n      \\n Do the official schools of medicine\\n      teach such an art today? I am afraid not: they are so intent on seeking\\n      the specific treatment for this or that named disease or the antibiotic\\n      that will most effectively put out of action the organism regarded as the\\n      cause of the disease, that they are losing sight of the individual\\n      himself.\\n      \\n But Homoeopathy in its persistent\\n      search for the reactions of the individual to his environment in the\\n      broadest sense, no matter of what the patient is complaining surely\\n      fulfills these requirements, especially when it is recognized that the\\n      homoeopathic potencies do not anything to the patient as do the drugs of\\n      the dominant school, but rather stimulate the patients own recuperative\\n      powers to overcome the infection or re - establish the normal metabolism\\n      which has become deranged by the illness.\\n      \\n When you consider how the homoeopathic\\n      physician diagnoses the individuality of his patient over and above the\\n      name of the disease from which he is suffering, and uses for the purpose\\n      of his prescription rather than the name of the disease this personal\\n      diagnosis of the patients mental and emotional reactions, his responses to\\n      changes in weather conditions, the alternations in his environment which\\n      influence his symptoms, etc., one realize how very individualistic is the\\n      Homoeopathic prescription fitted to that particular patient.\\n      \\n The homoeopathic physician does not\\n      seek for a remedy specific to any named disease and which he can thus\\n      apply almost automatically once he has made his organic diagnosis, which\\n      in quite an appreciable number of instances may ultimately be found to be\\n      wrong and so the treatment based upon it must therefore have been wrong.\\n      He does not, as is so often done, merely suppress the most outstanding\\n      symptom by an appropriate drug; for example giving an anodyne to mask the\\n      pain or removing the skin eruption by some strong local application, in\\n      other words putting the dust under the mat and pretending the room is\\n      clean.\\n      \\n Strangely enough the homoeopathic\\n      physician is often accused by his allopathic critic in his ignorance of\\n      Homoeopathy, of merely treating symptoms, whereas it is the critic himself\\n      who practices this superficial medicine. The homoeopathic physician, on\\n      the other hand, treats his patient as a whole through his symptoms and\\n      their modifications through changes in the environment, which is quite a\\n      different matter.\\n      \\n Homoeopathic therapy, unlike methods of\\n      treatment, is based on a natural law \"Similia Similibus\\n      Curentur\" \"Likes may be cured by likes\" which has been\\n      proved time and time again by experiment and which anyone with the will to\\n      do may prove for himself. It is not subject to constant change brought\\n      about by this or that latest discovery, and which itself will soon have to\\n      give way to the still later idea.\\n      \\n Having now introduced to you our actor,\\n      what of the scene in which he is to play his role?\\n      \\n This is the nineteen hundred and fifty\\n      - fourth year of the Christian era and the second year of the reign of our\\n      much loved and admired young Queen Elizabeth II, who will remember while\\n      in south Africa on her twenty - first birthday, before she had any idea\\n      that she would so soon be called to such an exalted position as she holds\\n      today, broadcast to the commonwealth and Empire her resolve to dedicate\\n      her life to the service of this grand community which dedication she\\n      recently repeated at her Coronation.\\n      \\n Here in Great Britain we have a more or\\n      less complete welfare state, with which idea some of us may very strongly\\n      disagree, whilst others believe such a development is the result of a\\n      natural very desirable social evolution.\\n      \\n As one necessary ingredient of this\\n      welfare state came, in 1948, the initiation of the National Health\\n      Service, through which the great majority of the population receives its\\n      medical attention, although it is rightly available to all.\\n      \\n When we come to consider the role that\\n      homoeo - therapeutics should play in this scheme, I would suggest that we\\n      should regard the problem from the purely medical aspect, forgetting any\\n      political party allegiances or sympathies we may have; or if we cannot\\n      forget them we should remember that the organization of the National\\n      Insurance Scheme of which the National Health Service is but a part, was\\n      first blue printed by the well - known Liberal supporter, Lord Beveridge,\\n      and the Health Service plans developed by the Coalition Government of all\\n      three major political parties.\\n      \\n We are living at present in an age\\n      which may very justifiably be regarded as a violent age in which have been\\n      developed so many appalling instruments of destruction, the use of some of\\n      which we are quite complacently accepting and from the use of others we\\n      are refraining, not because we consider them immoral, but simply through\\n      the fear of the wholesale destruction which would be caused by their use.\\n      We are seeing X-rays used in very high voltages in the treatment of\\n      cancer, we are being constantly remained of the use of dangerous drugs in\\n      medicine, without justification, in my opinion, bearing in mind the\\n      doubtful and evanescent ameliorations they produce and the violent\\n      surgical treatment of mental patients.\\n      \\n One further violence we should not\\n      forget is the way some of our foods are devitalized by the extraction of\\n      this or that portion of the natural product for purposes quite foreign to\\n      the well - being of the people who are to feed on them; or they are\\n      contaminated by the addition of this or that dangerous chemical, either\\n      during the growing of the plant, in the form of sprays, or as so called\\n      improvers in, for instance, the manufacture of white bread. It is very\\n      significant in this regard that quite a lot of attention is paid to the\\n      protection of the man who sprays the crops, but the right of the consumer\\n      to have uncontaminated food is slurred over by the unjustifiable statement\\n      that the amount of these chemicals so consumed is so small that it cannot\\n      have any bad effect on the consumer. We who practice Homoeopathy know how\\n      unwarranted is such a statement.\\n      \\n Can we homoeopathic physicians and\\n      patient hope to be able to do anything to make the still small voice of\\n      Homoeopathy heard in all this tumult, so that we may return to a saner and\\n      more healthful way of life and help our young Queen in her lifes work for\\n      the communitys sake?\\n      \\n Can we expect any help from the leaders\\n      of the medical profession? I am afraid not, because although I believe it\\n      accurate to state that there is a very slowly growing interest in, and\\n      tolerance of our work by individual doctors, the medical authorities are\\n      still, in their prejudice, strongly opposed to us. The London University\\n      still refuses to recognize our Hospital as a post - graduate teaching\\n      Hospital: the British Medical Association prohibits the formation of a\\n      homoeopathic section of its organization, and the Royal College of\\n      Physicians still refuses its membership to any one known as a homoeopathic\\n      physician. Yet in spite of this unfavourable environment, I firmly believe\\n      that there is a future for our method of therapeutics: but it will have to\\n      be pursued with courage, determination, foresight and energy. Surely if we\\n      believe as I do, that we are the guardians of a system of treatment\\n      destined to make our people healthier and therefore more efficient and\\n      happier, we would be failing in our duty to our country if we did not take\\n      every means in our power to acquaint the community at large with the\\n      advantages of this system and the dangers of ignoring it. This is a duty,\\n      not only of the profession, but also of the laity interested in\\n      Homoeopathy and who have experienced its benefits.\\n      \\n Every physician has two professional\\n      obligation to the community, that of preserving its health and that of\\n      endeavouring to restore it to being when it has fallen by the way.\\n      \\n The homoeopathic physician, thorough\\n      his knowledge acquired through the provings of drugs, even in\\n      infinitesimal doses, has, I believe, a very special responsibility as\\n      regards the prophylaxis of disease. It seems to me that a great deal of\\n      chronic ill health may quite conceivably be due to the manipulations of\\n      our foods and to the artificial manuring of the ground in which many of\\n      them are grown. Experiments have been carried our proving that plants\\n      grown in soil enriched by natural manuring, are much less prone to\\n      diseases than those grown with the help of artificial chemical manures. It\\n      seems a fairly justified conclusion that vegetables grown under these\\n      artificial conditions may quite well be deficient in something necessary\\n      for our perfect health. It is therefore incumbent upon the physician to\\n      advocate whenever possible the ingestion of healthily grown foods in the\\n      widest sense of that term.\\n      \\n The same duty applies when we consider\\n      the great amount of drugging in which the community at large indulges by\\n      its excessive smoking, particularly when aggravated by the practice of\\n      inhaling, and by the continued and prolonged use of drugs for this or that\\n      symptom, too often, unfortunately, though not always, on the prescription\\n      of their medical advisors.\\n      \\n There is a great lack throughout the\\n      community of any real enthusiasm for perfect health: we are only too prone\\n      to be content to follow like sheep, the unintelligent and harmful\\n      practices of the majority of our fellows.\\n      \\n Similarly in the curative realm, we\\n      homoeopathic physicians have special obligations.\\n      \\n When considering our position vis-a-vis\\n      the rest of the profession, we must never lose sight of the fact that our\\n      approach to the sick individual is a much broader and more comprehensive\\n      one than that of the dominant school. This latter prides itself on its\\n      scientific approach to its problems. One must, however, always be on ones\\n      guard against being hypnotized by that word scientific. The scientific\\n      aspect of any phenomenon or problem dealing with humanity is only one\\n      limited aspect of that problem. To get a complete picture one must\\n      consider other aspect, such as the aesthetic, emotional, maybe religious,\\n      and above all, perhaps one might say embracing all, the philosophical\\n      approach. This complex approach to his patients problem is the one that\\n      the homoeopathic physician always strives to adopt, and so never loses\\n      sight of the ego of the patient, while at the same time not forgetting his\\n      physical make - up.\\n      \\n Because this approach of ours to our\\n      patients is a much broader and more comprehensive one than the much\\n      vaunted scientific aspect, which the dominant school has come to regard as\\n      the Ultima Thule of medicine, I deplore the oft - repeated request of some\\n      of my colleagues that we should forsake our philosophy and make our work\\n      as scientific as theirs. I do not mean to imply by this that we should\\n      neglect the scientific angle of our patients illness but we should always\\n      remember that is only one facet of our problem. That is why we take such\\n      pains to diagnose our patients personality with his reaction to his\\n      environment in addition to the physical diagnosis of the case in order to\\n      arrive at our prescription for his malady. In other words, we should\\n      endeavour to lead our dominant school colleagues to our way of thinking,\\n      rather than that we should adopt theirs.\\n      \\n At the same time must always remember\\n      that if our philosophy should seem at any time to contradict so - called\\n      scientific laws, we must re - examine our philosophy, and if necessary\\n      modify it, while at the same time remembering that many times in the past\\n      what have been regarded as laws have ultimately been proved not to be so.\\n      Thus it is evident that we must never relax our self - examination.\\n      \\n What shall be the role of the\\n      homoeopathic laity?\\n      \\n The first thing for them to remember is\\n      that we are living in a democratic country whose government is dependent\\n      on the goodwill of the governed, and that, if a sufficient number of\\n      voters desire a certain line of action, that line will be adopted by the\\n      government.\\n      \\n The second thought is that there are\\n      not nearly sufficient doctors practising Homoeopathy in Great Britain to\\n      satisfy the present demand, let alone any further increased demand in the\\n      future, for this line of treatment.\\n      \\n Does not this seem strange, having\\n      regard to the great advantage to humanity that Homoeopathy provides? Not\\n      if one looks below the surface and so finds the reason for this shortage.\\n      \\n Surely the most potent reason is that\\n      Homoeopathy is not taught in the official Medical Schools, either as a pre\\n      - or post - graduate study. The London University when asked to recognize\\n      the Royal London Homoeopathic Hospital as a post - graduate Medical\\n      School, refused on the plea that as Homoeopathy was not taught in the\\n      undergraduate Medical Schools, it could not find a place for it in its\\n      post - graduate curriculum.\\n      \\n It is, of course, nonsense to suggest\\n      that a graduate should pursue his studies only in those subject of which\\n      he had already obtained some knowledge in his undergraduate days and\\n      should not wish to obtain information on any new or extra subject.\\n      \\n The University Medical Shools are\\n      enabled to a great extent through Government grants. We must therefore\\n      find some way of influencing whatever Government be in power to bring\\n      pressure to bear upon the London University to remove this obstacle to the\\n      better health of the community at large. I am quite satisfied that once\\n      this academic recognition is obtained we shave many more post - graduate\\n      students of Homoeopathy.\\n      \\n I believe than in a democratic\\n      community, having a universal State Medical Service, it is the bounden\\n      duty of the Government to remove all obstacles to the peoples obtaining\\n      that form of medical treatment in which they have confidence. So long as\\n      Homoeopathy is denied its legitimate status, so long must be Government be\\n      deemed to b failing in its duty to the country.\\n      \\n If, however, we are to achieve this\\n      desirable object of full recognition, we must all, professional and laity,\\n      be fired with enthusiasm, not only for the abstract cause of Homoeopathy,\\n      but for being partners with our young Queen in delicating our lives to the\\n      community.\\n      \\n When we do this we shall help to make\\n      this second Elizabethan era one to be remembered throughout the ages to\\n      come as surpassing the first Elizabethan era in that it gained not so much\\n      the economic and political leadership of the world - though that is not to\\n      be despised - but showed the way to the most healthful and spiritual way\\n      of life that all the world look notice and followed suit.\\n      \\n To sum up, the Role of Homoeopathy, as\\n      I see it, is to humanize the practice of medicine. By that I mean it must\\n      bring the practice of medicine into line with a reasoned philosophy of\\n      life, restore to it its artistry and rid it of all unnecessary hazards. It\\n      is to do this, not from any abstract academic sense of superiority, but in\\n      order the years to come are not those of merely another reign, but to\\n      ensure a veritable Renaissance, starting with the second Elizabethan era\\n      in which Great Britain will take its rightful place in the comity of\\n      nations as the pathfinder to a way of life for which posterity will be\\n      able to say \"Thank God for Queen Elizabeth the Second and her\\n      peoples.'\n",
      " 'Tresorie - Roentgenometric Pelvimetry [Roentgenometric Pelvimetry]\\n CHARLES W.PERKINS, M.D.\\n      \\n Norwalk, Conn\\n      \\n FOR some time the x-ray has been used\\n      to advantage in diagnosis of multiple pregnancy, position of fetus and\\n      fetal abnormalities. However, it has been only the past four or five years\\n      that any definite information has been obtained by roentgenographic\\n      methods of diagnoses in pelvimetry.\\n      \\n At the present time we are convinced\\n      that only by means of roentgenographs can be true proportions of the\\n      superior strait be determined, and that the ordinary external methods of\\n      Pelvimetry are not only occasionally misleading but proportionately\\n      inaccurate.\\n      \\n The present communication deals with\\n      the method of Herbert Thomas of Yale University. This method was developed\\n      in cooperation with the late Dr. W.A. Lafield, who was Professor of\\n      Roentgenology at the Yale Medical School.\\n      \\n Some of the reasons why roentgen\\n      pelvimetry has not been more universally adopted are probably due to the\\n      following factors.\\n      \\n (1) The majority of women will be\\n      delivered normally, whether or not pelvic measurements are made.\\n      \\n (2) The medical profession does not\\n      readily accept a new method after an established satisfactory routine has\\n      been in use.\\n      \\n (3) A new method of diagnosis incurs\\n      added expense.\\n      \\n (4) The present methods, although\\n      entirely speculative, are satisfactory in most cases.\\n      \\n (5) Roentgen pelvimetry cannot be\\n      performed by the obstetrician himself but requires the aid of a\\n      roentgenologist.\\n      \\n (6) The value of roentgenometric\\n      diagnosis is recent in origin and as yet not universally accepted.\\n      \\n If the knowledge of the size and shape\\n      of the pelvis is necessary to the practice of obstetrics, roentgen\\n      pelvimetry is a sound procedure, particularly in pre-emptors patients, and\\n      should and should be considered as an indispensable aid in these cases.\\n      \\n The method of Herbert Thoms as\\n      developed at Yale Medical School is not the only method. However, it can\\n      be classified as simple, accurate and rapid; being adaptable for use by\\n      other than experts in x-ray and obstetric diagnosis. As a technical\\n      procedure a well trained hospital technician can master its technic alter\\n      sufficient instruction.\\n      \\n Studies of recent years reveal the fact\\n      that external Pelvimetry fails to give uniform and accurate information in\\n      regard to the shape and size of the superior strait. This is often true of\\n      thin undersized individuals. In many patients of this type external\\n      measurements may suggest a contracted pelvis while the x-ray will show a\\n      relatively large pelvis with a subsequent natural labor and normal-sized\\n      child. On the other hand a stocky short person with similar external\\n      measurements will disclose a contracted pelvis which is an obstetric\\n      problem. Because of the apparent relationship between shortening of the\\n      transverse diameter and a secondary persistent occipito-posterior\\n      presentation, accurate information regarding this diameter is of clinical\\n      significance.\\n      \\n The observations of Thomas were made on\\n      twenty consecutive patients whose pelvis showed a relative or real\\n      shortening of the transverse diameter of the superior strait. In every\\n      instance a primary or secondary occipito posterior position was found\\n      after the patient was in labor. (Herbert Thoms, Surgery, Gynecology and\\n      Obstetrics, January, 1933). It therefore has been proved that an actual or\\n      relative shortening of a transverse diameter of the superior strait\\n      results in a limitation of space that is greater in the anterior than in\\n      the posterior half of the superior strait. Under these circumstances, when\\n      the head descends early in labor, the occiput is forced to rotate\\n      posteriorly.\\n      \\n The x-ray offers additional information\\n      in determining the size of the fetal head. It has been noted in x-ray\\n      examination of the unengaged fetal head that it lay with the transverse\\n      diameter of the superior strait, the occiput being either to the right or\\n      left; therefore, if roentgenogram of the patient is taken in the supine\\n      position with the fetus in the uterus, it will cast a shadow which is an\\n      enlarged profile of the head. The measurements of the occipital frontal\\n      diameter of the head can then be made. On numerous occasions this method\\n      of cephalometry, determining the diameter of the unmoulded head before and\\n      after cesarean section, has yielded accurate results. (Thomas, A.M.A.,\\n      February 24, 1934).\\n      \\n As experience increases in roentgen\\n      pelvimetry, the so-called labor test will be employed less. This, however,\\n      does not mean that the physician should not under estimate the importance\\n      of uterine contraction and the ability of the fetal head to mold. It has\\n      always followed that when something could be proved desirable in medicine\\n      for the better protection of the patient, such an advance would be\\n      demanded and eventually become routine. We may concede, therefore, that\\n      roentgen pelvimetry has a distinct place in the examination of every\\n      primiparous woman. In many instances, according to Thomas and others,\\n      external; measurements were normal but the x-ray examination revealed a\\n      contracted pelvis. On the other had, in certain patients whose external\\n      measurements suggested a cesarean section roentgen pelvimetry proved\\n      otherwise and they were subsequently delivered in a normal manner.\\n      \\n CENTIMETER GRID METHOD.\\n      \\n The procedure in this method may be\\n      summarized by stating the following:.\\n      \\n (1) The patient is placed on the\\n      roentgenographic table in the semi- recumbent position.\\n      \\n (2) The level of the superior strait\\n      above the sensitized film is established.\\n      \\n (3) The tube target is centered about\\n      five centimeters posterior to the symphysis, at thirty-two inches from the\\n      sensitized film, The exposure is made.\\n      \\n (4) The patient is removed from the\\n      table, the tube target and sensitized film remaining in situ.\\n      \\n (5) A lead plate, or centimeter grid,\\n      with perforations exactly one centimeter apart, is introduced into the\\n      same plane as that previously occupied by the superior strait and a second\\n      (flash) exposure is made on the same sensitized film as was used used in\\n      the previous exposure.\\n      \\n (6) Development of the film shows the\\n      outline of the superior strait and the shadows of the perforations, the\\n      assistance between which represents centimeters in the plane of the\\n      superior strait. The anteroposterior and transverse diameters of the\\n      superior strait in its use proportions may be drawn on centimeter-square\\n      paper by following the course of the shadow of the superior strait and\\n      transcribing it.\\n      \\n As this time I wish to express my\\n      thanks to Dr. Thoms for his personal advice and instruction which helped\\n      me to master the technic of his method.'\n",
      " 'Tresorie - NOTATU DIGNUM [Test Of A Homoeopath]\\n\\n Complaints are not unfrequently made\\n      that the homoeopathic materia medica is too vast for practical utility;\\n      that the schematised list of symptoms are unprofitable, if not impossible\\n      reading.

Indeed, I think that the test of a genuine\\n      homoeopath might not unfairly be said to life in his capacity to read\\n      through a Schema with both profit and enjoyment because of the\\n      possibilities it reveals of dealing with cases occurring every day in\\n      practice.

Behind the diaphragm is a shallow air-tight compartment,\\n      leading from which are rubber tubes that are inserted in the external\\n      auditory canal during treatment, consequently any vibratory motion of the\\n      diaphragm, which must necessarily be an inward and a corresponding outward\\n      movement, would be exactly reproduced upon the membrana tympani, as the\\n      confined air, not being able to escape, will undergo an alternate\\n      condensation and rarefication in the external auditory canal.\\n      \\n Every vibratory movement of the strings\\n      of the instrument is communicated to the diaphragm by means of the bridge\\n      upon which it rests. These strings by varying their tension and length can\\n      be regulated to give a high or low rate of vibration as desired, for\\n      instance, the heaviest string left at its original length adjusted to a\\n      slight tension may make about fifty vibratory motions to the second, while\\n      the highest string on the instrument adjusted to a high tension and\\n      clamped down to one-fourth its original length would probably make three\\n      thousand vibratory motions to the second.\\n      \\n In the centre of the diaphragm is an\\n      attachment which works on a lever, and when hit by the cam on the\\n      revolving shaft lifts the diaphragm to a considerable extent, causing a\\n      powerful effect on the membrana tympani. This attachment can be adjusted\\n      at four different leverages, which causes a modification or increase of\\n      its intensity and can be regulated at from one to twenty-five vibratory\\n      movements to the second. This is only used in very bad cases and for not\\n      more than five minutes continuously.\\n      \\n The instrument which I have been\\n      describing in an improvement on the first manufactured, and as far as I\\n      know, is the only one which offers the same facilities for applying this\\n      method of massage. The class of patients in my experience who are\\n      generally benefited from the first, are those in which the mucous membrane\\n      lining the tympanic cavity and Eustachian tubes is in a hypertrophic\\n      condition. The membrana tympani are depressed, opaque, and thickened. They\\n      usually complain of a stiffed sensation in the ears, with a great deal of\\n      tinnitus aurium, and that their hearing is worse during a cold. In cases\\n      where the mucous membranes are atrophied with a large external auditory\\n      canal perfectly dry and Eustachian tubes patulous, and generally very\\n      little tinnitus, this or no other treatment has done very much good in the\\n      majority of cases, and in looking ever my records I find that only about\\n      five per cent. have been relieved, while in the before-mentioned cases the\\n      good results reach at least seventy-five per cent. In treating persons, I\\n      always select the rate of vibration which corresponds in pitch, if\\n      possible, to that caused by the diseased condition of the ears. If there\\n      is no tinnitus to guide me, I find whether the patient can hear a high or\\n      low sound better; if it is a low sound, a high rate of vibration is used\\n      in treatment, and vice versa, A point which I would like to explain here\\n      is this: It is not necessary that the sound from the instrument should be\\n      of the same quality of the tinnitus experienced by the patient, but merely\\n      the same pitch. for instance, if a banjo, where one of the strings was\\n      adjusted when sounded to produce a certain note, and a musical instrument\\n      of any other kind, whose quality of tone was entirely different, was made\\n      to sound the same note in a room, the string on the banjo would vibrate in\\n      sympathy, which has been proven by experiment, any other note, no matter\\n      how loud, would have no effect. Another point is in the way the strings of\\n      the vibrometer are set in motion. On the revolving shaft is a wheel\\n      projecting from which are metallic picks which hit the string it is\\n      adjusted over. It does not make any difference in the number of vibratory\\n      motions per second, whether the string is hit fast or slow, but at the\\n      time the string is first hit the intensity is greater than it is just\\n      before being hit again, and as the motion of the wheel is perfectly\\n      rhythmic, revolving so many times to the second, it has just as good an\\n      effect as if the intensity during the fraction of a second did not vary at\\n      all. The idea of using vibratory motion, as I have said before, originated\\n      within my mind some years ago, and later put into practical operation, and\\n      as far as I know, was the first to lay before the profession in a\\n      scientific manner, this method of massage.\\n      \\n I have found that when two of the\\n      strings upon the vibrometer were regulated in such a way that when both\\n      were set in vibration at the same time, producing the sensation of a\\n      harmonious sound, the effect in some cases on the tinnitus was especially\\n      beneficial, relieving, where the various kinds of vibrations produced by a\\n      single string failed. Sub-acute cases of deafness, accompanied by tinnitus\\n      aurium, are quickly relieved, as the following case will illustrate:.\\n      \\n Mrs. M. Young, married lady, aet. 26,\\n      called at my office, April 1, 1893, complaining of partial deafness and\\n      tinnitus aurium. She had a stuffed sensation, or as if cotton had been\\n      packed in the external auditory canal. She says the tinnitus was so\\n      annoying as to prevent sleep. On examination, found considerable\\n      retraction of the membrana tympani, and hearing for the watch, on the\\n      right side five inches, on the left, seven inches. The Eustachian tube\\n      were partially closed, which made inflation somewhat difficult, giving\\n      slight relief. I used several of the vibrations on the different strings\\n      without immediate benefit.\\n      \\n April 4th.-She came again, and reported\\n      that no improvement had taken place. I again inflated her ears, after\\n      which she sat down to the vibrometer. The central attachment was used with\\n      considerable force continuously for four minutes, after which she declared\\n      that the tinnitus had entirely ceased in the right ear, and greatly\\n      modified in the left; the hearing for the watch had increased for both\\n      ears to fourteen inches, and the stuffed sensation had almost entirely\\n      disappeared. On inspection of the membrana tympani, found them\\n      comparatively very slightly retracted. On April 8th, found improvement had\\n      continued, when the same treatment was used for three minutes; after which\\n      she declared herself completely relieved of the tinnitus and stuffed\\n      sensation, with hearing powerfully restored. Saw her again on April 13th,\\n      when she declared the good results from last treatment to have still\\n      continued.\\n      \\n I find that in the majority of cases,\\n      when the strings of the instrument are used it is only necessary to strike\\n      them lightly with the friction wheel. In vibrating the heavy string, I\\n      generally set the bridge back behind the central attachment, and adjusting\\n      the motor in such way that the belt is at a considerable tension, so that\\n      the pulley-wheel revolves slowly. I also generally use this adjustment\\n      when setting in motion two strings at one time. The principle of this\\n      method of treatment embraces two essential features which to my mind makes\\n      this system of massage the only scientific one applicable to the membrana\\n      tympani and its associate sound-conducting parts. Message is the\\n      application of motion to disease, and its scientific administration\\n      consists of its application in a systematic manner. In applying massage in\\n      aural diseases, it is necessary to produce a to-and-fro movement of the\\n      membrana tympani, and, if possible, by a force which is harmless and at\\n      the same time effective. The vibrometer fulfils these conditions. Any of\\n      the strings on the instrument that may be set in motion by the\\n      friction-wheel, will produce a certain number of vibratory movements to\\n      the second of time, and the movements of the central attachment are also\\n      measured. What could be more systematic than this? The motions of the\\n      membrana tympani were intended by nature to its vibratory, and as the\\n      vibrometer generates measured motion, and these motions are vibratory,\\n      theoretically we have a scientific and effective method of massage in\\n      aural diseases; and, as demonstrated practically by the use of the\\n      vibrometer, we have in fact a great scientific advance over all previous\\n      methods. Since the introduction of this treatment in aural diseases, it\\n      makes possible a more or less benefit in cases of deafness heretofore\\n      considered hopeless, and has opened up the field for the treatment of\\n      aural diseases to such an extent that the number of deaf patients seeking\\n      relief at the aurist\\'s hands will at least double itself.\\n      \\n DISCUSSION.\\n      \\n H.C. HOUGHTON, M.D.: Dr. Garey\\'s\\n      admirable paper gives us the description of the vibrometer, an instrument\\n      devised under his personal direction and inspection, for the purpose of\\n      applying massage to the ear. It is the only instrument of the kind on the\\n      market, so far as I am aware, and after a somewhat prolonged use of it, I\\n      am prepared to recommend the latest production of the vibrometer company.\\n      \\n This instrument is a decided\\n      improvement over the instrument first sent out, and is capable of\\n      producing a most profound effect upon the drum-head and ossicula; indeed,\\n      upon the entire auditory apparatus. I am able to confirm Dr. Garey\\'s\\n      statement of the effect of high and low vibrations us regards treatment.\\n      \\n I have also been very much interested\\n      in the use of stringed or reed instruments for diagnosis, and find that we\\n      can detect any abnormal sensitiveness of the auditory nerve to high or low\\n      tones. Some patients are extremely sensitive to all tones, high or low;\\n      others to high tones and not to low tones; others, conversely. Again, in\\n      some instances, there is a peculiar sensitiveness to single tones or to\\n      discords produced by sounding the note and half-note at the same time.\\n      Under the action of the central attachment of the vibrometer this\\n      sensitiveness is modified, the sensitiveness to high tones disappearing\\n      and being replaced by a low tone or, conversely, under treatment, a low\\n      tone disappears and a high tone is established, temporarily, at least.\\n      Again, in cases of recent origin, treatment will substitute an undefined\\n      rushing sound for a definite musical tone, either high or low, and later,\\n      the treatment will abolish this, the patient being relieved of this\\n      intensely annoying symptom. In some cases, with this relief, there is an\\n      improvement in the audition; in other cases, no improvement follows.\\n      \\n I confess to the domination of the\\n      material over my mind in my earlier experience with massage, and I think\\n      the inclination of operators will be to use a far greater degree of power\\n      than is necessary. I therefore notice with great satisfaction Professor\\n      Garey\\'s remark that \"the object should be to produce a to-and-fro\\n      motion to the membrana tympani, and, if possible, by a force which is\\n      harmless and at the same time effective.\" I would hardly say\\n      \"to-and-fro motion of the drum-head,\" because I think that the\\n      expression is liable to perpetuate the motion which is fixed in the minds\\n      of most physiologists, that the drum-head moves as a whole, with a\\n      to-and-fro motion.\" That is true under the influence of the Politzer,\\n      Siegle\\'s otoscope and similar instruments; but it certainly does not so\\n      move in the ordinary function of audition, but stands as the iris does in\\n      the eye, as an adjustor, a regulator of sound-force; in some sense as the\\n      iris does in its relation with the lens, to adjust, regulate and direct\\n      the essential force, and the vibration of the drum-head is at every node;\\n      every portion receives impressions that are converted into molecular\\n      disturbances of varying lengths, according as they are produced upon the\\n      stiff and unyielding portions of the drum-head at the periphery, along the\\n      manubrium, or in the more attenuated and easily-yielding portions which\\n      the between these two areas. Not only so, but these impulses are\\n      communicated to the contained air of the tympanum, and make their\\n      impression upon the acoustic nerve through the round window synchronously\\n      with the impression made through the ossicula.\\n      \\n This whole subject widens before my\\n      mind in such a way that one might wish himself twenty years and at liberty\\n      to devote himself to a term of research in acoustics, such as is offered\\n      only in the technical schools of the continent of Europe.\\n      \\n WM. R. KING, M.D.: In discussing Dr.\\n      Garey\\'s paper I shall begin by saying that his methods have been closely\\n      followed by me since the beginning of his experiments, owing to the fact\\n      that I have been greatly interested in the treatment of deafness and\\n      tinnitus by means of sound waves or by aural massage since 1887, and have\\n      experimented and treated many cases by this method since then, though with\\n      crude and unsatisfactory instruments. Since using the vibrometer-which,\\n      after much study and experimentation, is now presented to the profession\\n      in practical shape-I have undoubtedly increased my percentage of good\\n      results.\\n      \\n I don\\'t believe I am over-sanguine or\\n      carried away by interest in this method, and believe I can rightly\\n      appreciate that this does not offer us a panacea or cure-all for auditory\\n      ailments, and hope I may always be ready to see the failures and to strive\\n      to find methods or remedies to reach some of them.\\n      \\n In speaking of the application of the\\n      instrument, I wish to call attention to the central attachment or post foe\\n      vibrations. Dr. Garey has not given it as much attention in the paper as\\n      it deserves. It is very useful as a general means of aural massage,\\n      rougher in nature and more general in application than the strings which\\n      help to make up the instrument. I often use it before applying the\\n      \"similar found\" to a given case, as a species of gymnastics, to\\n      stimulate secretion and motion in the conducting apparatus of the ear,\\n      viz., membrana tympani and ossicles. In most cases-in fact, in all-where\\n      tinnitus is present, I follow this up immediately by the nearest approach\\n      to the similar pitch obtainable.\\n      \\n I agree thoroughly with Dr. Garey, that\\n      the best results are achieved in cases accompanying hypertrophic catarrh,\\n      and that the least benefit is apparent in cases of atrophic nature.\\n      \\n Regarding the method of treatment in\\n      the absence of tinnitus, my experience the does not coincide with that of\\n      the author of the paper entirely; I do not feel that as yet we have any\\n      safe rule to guide us. My method has been to try the numerous sounds and\\n      variations the of until I find the one that seems to give the best\\n      immediate results, or that the patient himself will speak of as very\\n      penetrating and powerful )though not necessarily loud and heavy).\\n      \\n It seems almost impossible at present\\n      to simulate all the qualities of tone as they occur in the ears of those\\n      suffering with tinnitus; in fact, it would appear to be unnecessary.\\n      However, it seems advantageous and quite necessary to secure the closest\\n      simulation of pitch, thus in many cases soon obliterating annoying\\n      tinnitus and improving hearing powers.\\n      \\n The arrangement permitting of the\\n      picking of two strings simultaneously adds decidedly the usefulness of the\\n      instrument, as it increases the range of pitch as well as varying the\\n      quality of tones procurable, thereby decidedly enlarging our field of\\n      application.\\n      \\n The force used for creating the message\\n      or gymnastics of the membrana tympani and the ossicles-viz, vibratory\\n      force or sound- carefully and scientifically applied, is nature\\'s remedy,\\n      because it is adapted by nature, and is the only force which can rightly\\n      or safely be applied to these delicate portions of this complex organ of\\n      hearing.\\n      \\n A startling commentary on this subject\\n      is the array of cases benefited who have been relegated to the shelf by\\n      ancient and modern otology; cases declared unhelpable have been vastly\\n      improved. Pray, make no mistake; I did not say all cases.\\n      \\n It may be interesting to hear the\\n      latest regarding the instrument which was first invented for the\\n      application of this method of aural massage Mr. E.J. Godman, the inventor\\n      and patentee, is constantly on the lookout, and always striving for\\n      improvements to his machine. He has made many that you all know of. Permit\\n      me to report a few so recent they have not yet left the factory.\\n      \\n First.-The machine has been taken from\\n      its case, and is now mounted on a solid stand or table of oak, being set\\n      below the level, or so that the face of the instrument is just level with\\n      the face of the table. This is all supported by rigid, solid metal legs,\\n      which absolutely prevent foreign vibrations.\\n      \\n Second.-The motor has been removed from\\n      its little shelf and relegated below the table. I t can be placed upon a\\n      box on the floor, a shelf against the wall, or, better yet, a shelf\\n      solidly attached to the metal supports of the table. A belt goes up\\n      through an aperture to a wheel on a shaft, the other extremity of which\\n      carries a wheel with a rubber tire (a friction wheel), which in its\\n      revolution, being in contact with a larger flat- surfaced wheel on the\\n      main shaft of the instrument, turns this in harmony with itself. This\\n      arrangement does away with the necessity of shifting the motor each time\\n      you wish to shift the carriage from one string to another- a consummation\\n      to be devoutly thankful for. The removal of the motor from the instrument\\n      as at present attached will recommend itself to all who have used the\\n      vibrometer, a great amount of undesirable jar being thus avoided.\\n      \\n Third.-Ratchet keys capable of very\\n      fine adjustment of tension of strings are now provided for the instrument.\\n      \\n Fourth.-A rheostadt or resistance-coil\\n      is now to be placed beneath the table between the storage battery and the\\n      switch, by this means enabling us to control the speed and number of\\n      revolutions to a nicety.\\n      \\n Other, though comparatively minor,\\n      improvements are being made, and others are contemplated, as, for\\n      instance, the substitution of a roughly corrugated rubber band for the\\n      picker on the wheel, thereby getting rid of the metallic sound of the\\n      picker on the wire strings.\\n      \\n I have experimented with a number of\\n      appliance for the production of the sounds and pitches that I have\\n      required, but I always fall back on the vibrometer, especially as at\\n      present constructed, for satisfactory work and results.\\n      \\n This instrument may be, and probably\\n      is, as yet, in its infancy. It, and the method it applies, can only be\\n      perfected by constant work and experimentation both on the part of the\\n      profession and of the manufacturers. Each improvement we can suggest, if\\n      it only should serve as a means of helping one solitary case, would be\\n      well worth our while.\\n      \\n The experiments being made by different\\n      methods for treating deafness by sound waves is indicative of the interest\\n      the profession has taken in the matter. It is indicative of a lack of\\n      something in our usual armamentarium which is greatly longed for by\\n      patient and doctor; that is, the means for making the deaf hear and for\\n      relieving distressing tinnitus. There has been a dearth in this direction,\\n      and perhaps there still is, but I believe fully that we have in aural\\n      massage by vibratory force a decided acquisition at our hands.\\n      \\n E. H. LINNELL., M.D.: I would simply\\n      like to ask Dr. King how long he uses the instrument, and whether he uses\\n      it according to the deafness.\\n      \\n DR. KING: Yes, decidedly. In an intense\\n      case of deafness I would have to use it a great deal longer. The central\\n      attachment I never carry over three or five minutes, and the whole\\n      treatment I don\\'t think is over carried over twenty or twenty-five minutes\\n      in one case, and usually averages from ten to fifteen.\\n      \\n HAROLD WILSON, M.D.: I have only to\\n      suggest, what I have elsewhere called attention to, the possibility of\\n      another mechanical device for securing vibratory motion. It is well known\\n      that in the make and break of a current of electricity, in the circuit of\\n      which there is a telephone, we get an influence upon the make and break of\\n      the current in the telephone. Now, it is a simple matter with which these\\n      makes and breaks are made as to obtaining any number of vibration that you\\n      wish. You may, by a mechanical device of some rotary motion, if you\\n      choose, make and break the current as rapidly as you please until you have\\n      reached several thousand vibrations a second, or you may even make the\\n      vibrations so slow us to be easily counted. The application of this\\n      suggestion has been put in force in my own practice, more or less, in the\\n      use of the telephone as connected with the induction-coil ordinary\\n      battery. The more intense the current, the more intense the sound. You can\\n      easily see that it is mere question of mechanics to secure these two\\n      sounds-intensity of vibration and rapidity of vibration. I will say,\\n      furthermore, that it has this advantage. There is no noise in the office,\\n      which I think is not altogether true of the vibrometer. I would suggest\\n      that so far as the vibrometer is concerned, if it could be made to be\\n      noiseless to anybody but the patient, it would be a decided improvement.\\n      In that respect the telephone is a decided improvement, because there is\\n      no noise except to the patient, because the noise is right at the ear of\\n      the patient. If I were seeking for a perfected instrument in this line, I\\n      would go outside of the banjo idea. As we have the most perfect writing\\n      machines, which have no connection with the ordinary method of writing,\\n      and sewing machines, which have no connection with sewing by hand, so it\\n      occurs to me that possibly the securing of he vibratory motion upon the\\n      ears might be obtained in a totally different way from that which you get\\n      when you listen to the drum of the guitar or an ordinary musical\\n      instrument, and I would suggest that the make and break of a telephone\\n      open a very fruitful field for mechanical experimentation.\\n      \\n H.C. HOUGHTON, M.D.: In my study of\\n      this subject I made the acquaintance of Mr. Bernhardt, of New York City,\\n      who is a personal friend of Mr. Emil Berliner, the inventor of the Emil\\n      Berliner Telephone, which is the instrument by which the Bell Telephone\\n      Company maintain their monopoly at present. Mr. Berliner is the inventor\\n      of the graphophone, and has, I think, covered this whole matter which Dr.\\n      Wilson has mentioned. As ordinary Bell telephone receiver is put into the\\n      circuit of an ordinary induction machine, and you can use it just as the\\n      English people use the audiometer, and as you remove the coil you modify\\n      the vibrations, which is covered with another disk and a tube, and that\\n      tube covered with a stethoscope tube, which is the same as we use for the\\n      phonograph or vibrometer, and, as Dr. Wilson has suggested, you can modify\\n      the intensity, and of course the whole matter is adjusted by the\\n      attachment of the cord, so that you can have fine vibrations. The\\n      intensity of the vibrations is regulated by the distance to which you\\n      uncover the cord. The only difficulty in the adjustment is that it has\\n      been so severe that it is really uncomfortable, and the noise of the\\n      instrument is reduced to the minimum for office use.\\n      \\n A.B. NORTON, M.D.: I will also add that\\n      in regard to the objection Dr. Wilson makes to the noise, there is no\\n      doubt it is an annoying thing in the office, and in that line I have some\\n      men at work on my suggestion. We are devising another machine, or\\n      instrument, which is to be entirely enclosed in a cabinet, so there will\\n      be no noise whatever in the room if it is made a success. The idea is a\\n      little crude, and I am quite uncertain whether it will amount to anything\\n      or not. Then, in the line of what Dr. King was speaking in regard to Mr.\\n      Goodwin-he called, at New York, to see me last week. I made two little\\n      suggestion to him, which I think would be in line with his advancement.\\n      One is the number of the picks. The present vibrometer has four picks I\\n      suggest the experiment of trying twelve or sixteen picks, which will make\\n      a more continuous sound; it may be of some value. Then, in regard to\\n      regulating the speed of the machine: you regulate that now by a series of\\n      buttons, so as to get three different speeds. We will have a very slight,\\n      intermediate speed, and a very rapid speed. My experience with the\\n      vibrometer is especially favorable. I think the idea is in the right\\n      direction, and it is simply a matter of instrumentation.']\n",
      "Test 14 of 18 completed.[ 'Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is a water-soluble vitamin, which is needed by the body to form collagen in bones, cartilage, muscle, and blood vessels. Dietary sources of vitamin C include fruits and vegetables, particularly citrus fruits such as oranges.Severe deficiency of vitamin C causes scurvy. Although rare, scurvy results in severe symptoms and can cause death. People with scurvy are treated with vitamin C and should be under medical supervision.Many uses for vitamin C have been proposed, but evidence of benefit in scientific studies is lacking. In particular, research on asthma, cancer, and diabetes remains inconclusive, and a lack of benefit has been found for the prevention of cataracts or heart disease.The use of vitamin C in the prevention or treatment of colds remains controversial. Extensive research has been conducted. Overall, vitamin C lacked an effect on the development of colds and on cold symptoms. However, the duration of the cold shortened slightly. Notably, people living in extreme circumstances, including soldiers in the subarctic, skiers, and marathon runners, had a 50% decrease in the risk of developing a cold. This area merits additional research and may be of particular interest to athletes or people in the military.'\n",
      " \"Honey is a sweet fluid made by honeybees from the nectar of flowers. It is generally safe, but there have been reports of certain toxic types of honey made from plants from the Rhododendron genus and others.Honey is easy for the body to absorb and use. It contains about 70-80 percent sugar. The rest is water, minerals, and some protein, acids, and other substances. Honey has been used for wounds, skin problems, and various diseases of the stomach and intestines.The antibacterial effects of honey are well-known. Research has been done on the role of honey in long-term wound management, as well as the treatment of ulcers, burns, Fournier's gangrene (a life-threatening bacterial infection), and diabetes. However, more high-quality studies are needed to make firm conclusions on the use of honey.\"\n",
      " 'Vitamin B12 is an essential water-soluble vitamin that is commonly found in a variety of foods, such as fish, shellfish, meat, eggs, and dairy products. Vitamin B12 is frequently used in combination with other B vitamins in a vitamin B complex formulation. Vitamin B12 is important in DNA synthesis. Vitamin B12 is bound to the protein in food. Acid in the stomach releases B12 from protein during digestion. Once released, B12 combines with a substance called intrinsic factor (IF) before it is absorbed into the bloodstream.The human body stores several years\\' worth of vitamin B12 in the liver, so low levels in the body are rare. Decreases in vitamin B12 levels are more common in the elderly, HIV-infected persons, and vegetarians. Inability to absorb vitamin B12 from the intestinal tract can cause a type of anemia called pernicious anemia. Fever and symptoms of \"excessive sweating\" have been reported with anemia due to low levels of vitamin B12; however, these are fixed with vitamin B12 treatment.'\n",

Tea tree oil is thought to have antiseptic properties and has been used to prevent and treat infections.Other traditional uses of tea tree oil include treatment of fungal infections (including fungal infections of the nails and athlete's foot), dental health, parasites, skin allergic reactions, and vaginal infections. In addition, there is evidence supporting tea tree oil use for acne; however, further research is needed.Tea tree oil should not be taken by mouth; there are reports of toxicity after consuming tea tree oil by mouth. When applied to the skin, tea tree oil is reported to be mildly irritating and has been associated with the development of an allergic skin reaction, which may limit its potential as an agent for the skin in some people.\"\n",
      " 'Melatonin is a hormone produced in the brain by the pineal gland from the amino acid tryptophan. The production and release of melatonin are stimulated by darkness and decreased by light, suggesting that melatonin is involved in circadian rhythm (the internal body clock) and regulation of diverse body functions. Levels of melatonin in the blood are highest prior to bedtime.The most common use of melatonin is to aid in sleep. The strongest evidence supporting the use of melatonin is for delayed sleep phase syndrome, insomnia in children and the elderly, jet lag, and sleep problems in people with behavioral, developmental, or mental disorders. The weakest evidence in support of melatonin is for work shift sleep disorder. Good evidence in support of melatonin for other uses is lacking.New drugs that block the effects of melatonin are being developed. These include BMS-214778 and luzindole, and they may have uses in various disorders.'\n",
      " 'Black cohosh is popular as an alternative to hormonal therapy in the treatment of menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes, mood disturbances, excessive sweating, palpitations, and vaginal dryness. Several studies have reported black cohosh may improve menopausal symptoms for up to one year, although the evidence is mixed.The mechanism of action of black cohosh remains unclear. Research suggests that there may be no direct effects on estrogen receptors, although this is an area of active controversy.Safety and efficacy beyond one year have not been proven. Reports suggest the safety of short-term use, including in women with menopausal symptoms for whom estrogen replacement therapy is not suggested. Nonetheless, caution is advised until better-quality safety data are available. There have been reports of liver damage and higher lead levels in the blood from black cohosh. Use of black cohosh in high-risk populations (such as in women with a history of breast cancer) should be under the supervision of a licensed healthcare professional.'\n",
      " 'Beta-carotene is a carotenoid. Carotenoids are red, orange, or yellow, fat-soluble compounds. These compounds are naturally present in many fruits, grains, oils, and vegetables. Alpha, beta, and gamma carotene are considered provitamins because they can be converted to active vitamin A.Commercially available beta-carotene is man-made or taken from palm oil, algae, or fungi. Beta-carotene is converted to retinol, which is essential for vision and growth.Studies in humans show that beta-carotene has promising use for oral leukoplakia (pre-cancerous mouth lesions) and for sunburn. However there was a lack of benefit for sun damaged skin, mole prevention, heart disease risk, infection with H. Pylori, cataract prevention, diabetes, and stroke.Research shows that beta-carotene increased the risk of bladder, lung, stomach, and prostate cancer. Also the general incidence of cancer in asbestos workers, smokers, or high risk individuals increased. Additionally, some research suggested increased risk of heart disease and death with beta-carotene supplementation.'\n",
      " 'L-arginine was first isolated in 1886, reportedly from the extract of a lupine (Lupinus spp.) seedling. Lupinus is a genus in the legume (Fabaceae) plant family.Arginine is an amino acid normally made by the body. Arginine is also found in many foods that have protein.Arginine becomes nitric oxide (a blood vessel-widening agent called a vasodilator) in the body. Early evidence suggests that arginine may help treat medical conditions that improve with increased vasodilation. These conditions include chest pain, atherosclerosis (clogged arteries), heart disease, heart failure, erectile dysfunction, peripheral vascular disease, and headaches from blood vessel swelling).Arginine also triggers the body to make protein and has been studied for healing wounds, bodybuilding, enhancing sperm production, and preventing tissue wasting in people with critical illnesses. However, caution is warranted. Arginine use was associated with death in some people with heart conditions. Caution is also needed when using arginine to treat pre-eclampsia (high blood pressure in pregnancy).Arginine hydrochloride has been used to treat metabolic alkalosis. This use should be under the supervision of a qualified healthcare professional.'\n",

The lignan components of flaxseed (not flaxseed oil) may possess antioxidant properties and alter estrogen activity.As a source of fiber, flaxseed (not flaxseed oil) has laxative properties. In large doses, or when taken without enough water, flaxseed may cause bowel obstruction. The effects of flaxseed on blood sugar levels are unclear.Flaxseed oil contains only the ALA component of flaxseed and not the fiber or lignan components.

      " 'Tresorie - The Present Status of Radiation in the Treatment of Malignant\\nConditions [Present Status Of Radiation in the Treatment Of Malignant\\nConditions]\\n ISIDORE ARONS, M.D.\\n      \\n New York, N.Y.\\n      \\n AT A meeting of the American Medical\\n      Association recently held in Cleveland, Dr. Joseph C.Bloodgood, in\\n      discussing a paper on radiation therapy, said that \"report at my\\n      clinic told me that 49 per cent of the patients previously operated on in\\n      the clinic now to for radiotherapy. This is based on results. They are not\\n      hopeless cases; they are still hopeful and they get well under\\n      radiotherapy. This has happened during the last three years, not because I\\n      have changed any but because the method of radiotherapy has changed. A\\n      great change has taken place. First of all, radium and x-rays are no\\n      longer looked on a last resort.\".\\n      \\n The foregoing bears witness to the\\n      progress made in the field radiation therapy. The manufacture of more\\n      adequate apparatus and the improved technic in its use reflect this\\n      improvement. Machines are used generally delivering twenty to thirty\\n      milliamperes of current at 200 K.V., while machines operating at 750 to\\n      1,000 200 K.V., using lower milliamperes, have been installed in several\\n      places in this country. Since the question of increased voltages began to\\n      dominate the field, machines operating at 400 to 600 K.V., using sealed\\n      tubes, have been manufactured in this country as well as on the been\\n      manufactured in this country as well as on the continent. This higher\\n      powered machines occupy little more space than the usual 200 K.V. machine.\\n      \\n The effectiveness of these stronger\\n      radiations is thought to be due to (1) the increased penetration and its\\n      consequently larger percentage depth doses, (2) the supposed higher\\n      selective action of short have length radiation on malignant cells, and\\n      (3) greatly increased x-ray output. Clinics using super-voltages report\\n      that clinical results are somewhat better than those secured through the\\n      use of the lesser voltage machine.\\n      \\n Experimental effort, from the physical\\n      and biologic point of view, has been exerted to establish to standard\\n      basis for radiotherapy since Roentgens discovery thirtyfive years ago, and\\n      its application five years later. Radiotherapists have only recently begun\\n      to understand the principles of clinical application or radiotherapy in\\n      the treatment of malignant conditions.\\n      \\n Regaud selected the rabbits testicle\\n      for his experiments because its histologic cellular structure was highly\\n      sensitive to radiation, containing cells which are in a state of active\\n      mitosis resembling that of malignant tissue. In 1922, Regaud reported that\\n      of malignant, tissue. In 1922, Regaud reported that it was impossible to\\n      sterilize the testicle by a single dose of radiation without causing\\n      serious damage to the overlying skin. The dose required to produced such\\n      radio necrosis was equivalent to about three radionecrosis was equivalent\\n      to about three erythemas when administered in one dose. However, by\\n      dividing the dose in such a manner as to prolong the treatment over a\\n      period of fourteen days, a total dose of about five erythemas could be\\n      given causing complete sterilizations without damage to the skin. Thus it\\n      is seen that by prolonging the time of treatment the cutaneous dose could\\n      be increased nearly 50 per cent without causing necrosis.\\n      \\n The above experiments were reported,\\n      and the same results determined, by Schinz and Slotopolsky in 1926, and\\n      again by Regaud and Ferroux in 1927. These experiments formed the\\n      foundation for the clinical studies of Pfahler (America), Hohlfelder\\n      (Germany) and Coutard (France), who have swung the pendulum from massive\\n      radiation, as advocated by the German school, to that of the protected\\n      fractional dose method. Results have been achieved by this method which\\n      are superior to previously reported; these are obtained by the improved\\n      method of administering a large dose to the (3 days) without causing\\n      destructive effects to the surroundings normal structure (or cancer bed);\\n      its effect are rather biologic than physical. The clinical application of\\n      the method of radiation by Pfahler, Countard, and Berven (Sweden) in the\\n      treatment of cancer of the tonsil, pharynx and larynx and have proved the\\n      radio-sensitive properties of squamous carcinoma, previously considered\\n      incapable of of responding to radiation.\\n      \\n According to Coutard, the neoplasm is\\n      exposed to x-rays twice daily, giving a total dose of 350 r to400 r to two\\n      areas, using 190 to 200 k.v., four milliamperes, two millimeters of copper\\n      and three millimeters of aluminum filtration at a distance of fifty of\\n      sixty centimeters, for lesion of the head and neck. For deeply situated\\n      lesions, such as cancer of the uterus, the focal distance varies from 80\\n      to 100 centimeters, the area of the field for the head and neck conditions\\n      being only 50 to 100 square centimeters, while those of the lower abdomen\\n      require on an average of 250 to 300 square centimeters. For the\\n      sterilization of the radio-sensitive squamous carcinomatous growth, a\\n      depth dose of 3,000 r to 4,000 r is given, while stronger dose is\\n      necessary for the radio-resistant tumors.\\n      \\n In the course of treatment of principle\\n      guides a radio reaction of the covering epithelium and the radio reaction\\n      of the cancer cells. The radio reaction of the cutaneous epithelium is\\n      called \"radio epidermitis.\"characterized by loss of epithelial\\n      layers and denudation of the dermis. The reaction of the mucous membrane ,\\n      called \"radio epithelitis,\" manifests itself by loss of the\\n      epithelial layer sand denudation of the mucous membrane, epithelial layers\\n      and denudation of the corium which becomes covered by a fibrinous and\\n      false membrane; of clear. The duration of both describe radio reactions is\\n      six weeks. Each appears at the beginning of three weeks and disappears at\\n      the beginning of the ninth week.\\n      \\n Should the total or daily dose or the\\n      intensity per minute be too high, or the filtration or the tension too\\n      low, the cancer bed would be modified. the nutrition of the malignant\\n      cells becomes impaired The cellular radio- sensitivity, which seems to be\\n      linked up not only with the mitosis of the cell but above all with the\\n      activity of their interchange with the cell but above all with the\\n      activity of their interchange with the surrounding normal structures,\\n      becomes diminished and at times suppressed. The cancer cells become\\n      incentive to radiation. This phenomenon is called \"radio-\\n      vaccination\" by Regaud.\\n      \\n Observation of clinical facts shows\\n      that changes in the surrounding normal tissue result from excessive daily\\n      doses and intensity per minute per minute causing radio resistance of the\\n      tissue. Conversely, radio- sensitivity would be prolonged with a smaller\\n      daily dosage and the resultant extended period.\\n      \\n Realizing that better results may be\\n      obtained by prolonged treatment, Coutard and his collaborators in the last\\n      few years have begun to extend the duration of treatment of certain\\n      so-called radio-resistant cancers from thirty to ninety days, giving weak\\n      daily doses in order of about 175, 220, 225 and 250 r per day, dividing\\n      the dose in two treatments. By this method he was able to cure a certain\\n      number of lesions on which he had not been able previously to obtain the\\n      same results, such as very differentiated epidermoid epithelioma invading\\n      the muscles and cartilages, glandular epithelioma of the breast ad the\\n      thyroid body, and special round celled epitheliomas of the upper part of\\n      the ethmoid and the adjacent sinuses. This mode of prolonged treatment not\\n      only controlled the condition locally but it lessened the frequency of\\n      metastasis.\\n      \\n When radiating a cancer of very\\n      embryonic, very radio-sensitive growths, the energy factor is predominant.\\n      The action of the x-rays seems to be direct and rapid; the treatment can\\n      be accomplished within fifteen to twenty days. The cells are destroyed and\\n      generally normal structures are affected very little. When radiating the\\n      less embryonic type of growths, the time of treatment should be longer.\\n      \\n Pursuing these general principles, I\\n      have adopted the Countard method with some slight modifications. The cures\\n      which I shall illustrate will show that the percentage of cures in a\\n      number of most dangerous epidermoid carcinomas has markedly increased and\\n      that some conditions formerly considered hopeless have been temporarily\\n      cured. In conclusion I wish to emphasize the following facts:.\\n      \\n (1) Cure of cancer by x-rays is still\\n      difficult and must not be entered into lightly and causally.\\n      \\n (2) Radiotherapy is just as radical in\\n      method as surgery, and requires great skill, judgment and experience.\\n      \\n (3) The cooperation of the pathologist\\n      and the radiotherapist is imperative for a proper estimate of the\\n      radio-sensitivity in relation to treatment of the lesion.\\n      \\n (4) Daily examination of the patient is\\n      necessary; modification of the normal structure and general reaction by\\n      the x-ray treatment sometimes appears to quickly that it is often\\n      necessary to diminish the daily dose or the size of the field in the\\n      course of treatment.\\n      \\n (5) There exists no fixed method of\\n      treatment, only a simple clinical treatment for each individual patient\\n      and for the special type of tumor..\\n      \\n (6) Improvement in roentgen apparatus\\n      of higher voltages, producing more penetrating rays, will permit a better\\n      relation between destruction of malignant cells and preservation of the\\n      supporting, and the radio sensitivity of the tumor may be prolonged.'\n",

This is the city where\\n      Homoeopathy was first introduced by Rajendra Lal Dutta of hallowed memory,\\n      who spent a princely fortune for dissemination of its principles and\\n      practice among his countrymen. This is the city where took place the\\n      dramatic conversion of one of the then medical luminaries of the first\\n      magnitude, to the practice of Homoeopathy under the influence of Rajendra\\n      Lal. I mean Dr. Mahendra Lal Sircar who became the high priest of\\n      Homoeopathy, spread its glory far and wide and gained thereby an\\n      international reputation for himself. This is the city where the\\n      celebrities of Homoeopathy like Dr. Berigny, Dr. Salzar, Dr. P.C.\\n      Majumdar, Dr. D. N. Roy. Dr. Younan, Dr. J.N. Majumdar, Dr. Baridbaran\\n      Mukherji, Dr. S.K. Nag, Dr. A.N. Mukherji, Dr. T.N. Palit, Dr. G.\\n      Dirghangi and a host of other talented physicians practised their\\n      profession with credit and success and held aloft the banner of\\n      Homoeopathy. This is the city where exist pioneer institutions for the\\n      teaching of Homoeopathy. This is the city wherefrom Homoeopathy has spread\\n      to all parts of India and its votaries are doing yeomans service for the\\n      good of the suffering humanity.\\n      \\n We are meeting this evening on a\\n      historic occasion and we have to arrive at decisions which might make or\\n      mar the future history of Homoeopathy in India. It may be that forces of\\n      disruption, destruction and obstruction are at work; it may be that self\\n      and vested interests seem to thwart the smooth progress of Homoeopathy; it\\n      may be that some may seem to play in the hands of the Powers that are not\\n      too sympathetic to the cause of Homoeopathy; it may be that the present\\n      seems to be chaotic and future of Homoeopathy dubious but great is truth\\n      indeed and will prevail. We should not lose heart or throw up the sponge.\\n      Tradition, authority, sectarianism, dogmatism are great obstacles on the\\n      way. But obstacles and difficulties are meant to be fought out and\\n      overcome. Strifes and dissensions, discords and disunities may hamper our\\n      progress but they are nonetheless signs of lifes activities. It is a good\\n      augury that the Homoeopathic profession is shaking off its age - long\\n      slumber and getting more and more conscious of its duties and obligation,\\n      its rights and privileges and of its short - comings and practical\\n      difficulties. The life of Hahnemann is there to encourage us; the\\n      masterful will of his dynamic spirit is there to inspire us to intensify\\n      our activities; his achievements are there to goad us to realise greater\\n      success; and his personality is always before us to take lessons from, in\\n      our life which as Swami Vivekananda puts it, is \"a process of\\n      unfolding and development of a being under circumstances tending to press\\n      it down.\"\\n      \\n That Homoeopathy is a scientific system\\n      of treatment, philosophically sound, logically unimpeachable, practically\\n      highly efficacious in curing the sick and cheap enough to suit the poor\\n      economic condition of the Indian masses - has become a much talked - of\\n      subject in the country. But why is it not spreading sufficiently and\\n      adequately in our motherland or in fact anywhere in the world? Why is our\\n      National Government not still keen on according official recognition to\\n      this superb system of healing art or providing ways and means for its\\n      development and diffusion? Why the public opinion is not gaining strength\\n      enough to put sufficient pressure on our Government to take interest in\\n      it? Why sufficient number of fully equipped Homoeopathic teaching\\n      institutions and hospitals are not growing to turn out adequate number of\\n      fully qualified Homoeopathic physicians in the country?\\n      \\n It is high time that we should draw the\\n      attention of the profession and the laity to provide answers to so many\\n      \"whys\" and to solve the pressing problems in the matter\\n      concerned. On a cursory view it becomes evident that the Homoeopathic\\n      profession, the people and the Government are each individually and\\n      collectively responsible for this impasse.\\n      \\n The so - called Allopathy still\\n      occupies the dominant place in any country, even in the land of birth of\\n      Homoeopathy. It is no wonder that Homoeopathy, being a discovery of merely\\n      a century and a half still lags behind its rival shool. But it is a wonder\\n      of wonders that Homoeopathy has already encompassed the whole world within\\n      such a short period since it was ushered into existence by Hahnemann.\\n      History of man reveals that nowhere a new truth was accepted by him easily\\n      and readily, obsessed as he is with conservatism, tradition, authority and\\n      vested interests. Nonetheless the triumphant march of Homoeopathy with a\\n      such a meteoric speed throughout the length and breadth of the world is a\\n      proof positive of the truth inherent in the system and phenomenal\\n      therapeutic efficacy of this healing art. It is one more glaring instance\\n      of mans love of truth against heavy odds that impede his progress at every\\n      step.\\n      \\n For the propagation of any new truth\\n      and its acceptance by man, in general, the first and foremost condition is\\n      the turning out of sufficient number of persons who have realised the\\n      truth and are adept in the practice of it. This involves establishment of\\n      a sufficient number of teaching institutions which will turn out experts\\n      in the science and art of Homoeopathy; and a sufficient number of\\n      Homoeopathic Hospital where, the efficacy of this system of treatment will\\n      be put to test.\\n      \\n Human knowledge is becoming\\n      unmanageably vast. The appearance of specialists has become indispensable.\\n      So special Hospitals for the treatment of specific types of diseases have\\n      sprung forth elsewhere, e.g. Tuberculosis Hospitals, Cancer Hospitals,\\n      Hospital for Tropical Diseases etc. Because of organisation of these\\n      hospitals people generally think of getting themselves treated in these\\n      institutions. As there are no fully - equipped general Homoeopathic\\n      Hospitals and not to speak of special Homoeopathic Hospitals and not to\\n      speak of special Homoeopathic Hospitals the result is Homoeopathy is not\\n      getting a fair chance of treating those diseases like tuberculosis,\\n      cancer, acute infectious diseases of epidemic type e.g., Small-pox,\\n      Cholera etc. on a large and organised scale. Consequently the general\\n      public cannot keep much faith in this treatment and mostly take recourse\\n      to homoeopathic treatment when the case is \"past all hope and past\\n      all surgery\". Hence the establishment of fully - equipped\\n      Homoeopathic institutions (College - cum - Hospitals) is an imperative\\n      necessity for enhancing the prestige of the Homoeopathic profession and\\n      for convincing the people about the therapeutic efficacy of this system of\\n      treatment. Is it not a pity that Homoeopathy once established its\\n      reputation by treating Cholera cases in this city and now nobody thinks of\\n      this treatment in Cholera cases and rushes the patient to the Allopathic\\n      Hospitals which are especially meant for these types of patients? How can\\n      we hope to gain ground under these circumstances?\\n      \\n The next great obstacle is the apathy\\n      and in many cases active antagonism of our Government, both at the Centre\\n      and at least in some of the State, towards Homoeopathy. The Government is\\n      under the thumb of its medical directorates which are solely manned by\\n      Allopathic doctors. The main reasons for the non - acceptance of the\\n      Homoeopathic system of treatment may be summed up in three words:\\n      tradition, authority and professionalism. Their psychology is easily\\n      understood if it is borne in mind that the conservative inertia of human\\n      mind attempts to reject any new thought will all the means at its\\n      disposal. Another reason is due to vested interests. Even a cursory glance\\n      at the history of origin and spread of Homoeopathy, enables one to find\\n      out that the opposition to this system from the start, was not scientific\\n      but rather of commercial nature on the part of the apothecaries who were\\n      afraid of losing their trade - profits. We regret to note that the Central\\n      Government have not yet implemented a single recommendation put forward by\\n      the Homoeopathic Enquiry Committee, Planning Commission. Third Health\\n      Ministers Conference, Ad Hoc Committee etc. though Homoeopathic Acts have\\n      been passed in the States of Bombay, U.P., Madhya Pradesh, Travancore -\\n      Cochin, Bihar etc. I is curious to note that W. Bengal is the only State\\n      where a Homoeopathic Bill has recently been thrown out by the State\\n      Government.\\n      \\n Another great obstacle is the\\n      psychology of the general mass of population who fail to adopt a proper\\n      philosophical attitude towards Homoeopathy and takes the Homoeopathic\\n      Therapeutic Law as great paradox contrary to common sense. Unless we can\\n      educate the public in the matter, we cannot hope to secure their whole -\\n      hearted support for this system of treatment.\\n      \\n Lack of enthusiasm for constructive\\n      works on the part of the Homoeopathic profession, the apathy of our\\n      Government and hesitancy on the part of the public to accept Homoeopathy\\n      are great obstacles to the spread of this system of treatment in the\\n      country. Unless this vicious circles is broken the progress of Homoeopathy\\n      is bound to be impeded. We have to fight on all fronts if we aspire to\\n      achieve victory in our battle for the cause of Homoeopathy and the\\n      suffering humanity.\\n      \\n But our first necessity as pointed out\\n      by the Soul of India expressing itself through Sri Aurobindo, is: If India\\n      is to survive and do her appointed work in the world, the youth of India\\n      should learn to think, to think on all subjects, to think independently,\\n      fruitfully, going to the heart of things, not stopped by their surface,\\n      free of pre - judgements, shearing sophism and prejudice asunder as with a\\n      sharp sword smiting down obscurantism of all kinds as with a mace of\\n      Bhima.\\n      \\n \"Let our brains no longer, like\\n      European infants, be swathed with swaddling clothes; let it have recover\\n      the free and unbound motion of the Gods, let it have not only the\\n      minuteness but the wide mastery and sovereignty natural to the intellect\\n      of Bharata and easily recoverable by it if it once accustomes itself to\\n      feel its own power and be convinced of its own worth.\\n      \\n \"The old fixed foundations have\\n      been broken up, we are tossing in the waters of a great upheaval and\\n      change. It is no use clinging to the old ice - floes of the past, they\\n      will soon melt and leave their refugees struggling in perilous waters. It\\n      is no use landing ourselves in the infirm bog, neither sea nor good, dry\\n      land of a second - hand Europeanism. We shall only die there a miserable\\n      and unclean death.\\n      \\n \"No we must learn to swim and use\\n      that power to reach the good vessel of unchanging truth; we must land\\n      again on the eternal rock of ages.\"\\n      \\n Yes, we must expand, we must assimilate\\n      whatever is assimilable for our growth. Stagnation and contraction are the\\n      signs of Death. Our knowledge must be aggressive, must diffuse through the\\n      rank and file of the whole Homoeopathic profession if we wish to survive\\n      and perpetuate ourselves; to leave an extensive ignorance either below or\\n      around us is to expose ourselves to the perpetual danger of being\\n      exterminated as a professional entity.\\n      \\n In fine, I welcome you, once again, on\\n      this historic occasion to this historic city to deliberate, to exchange\\n      view points and to come to agreed decisions with regard to our future line\\n      of action in respect of Homoeopathy in all its aspects.'\n",
      " 'Tresorie - SOME OBSERVATIONS ON NEURASTHENIA AND ITS TREATMENT\\n[Neurasthenia & Treatment]\\n\\n WHEN, thirty-five years ago, the writer\\n      first made the acquaintance of what is now called neurasthenia, it was\\n      known as spinal irritation, and the best of modern researches have been\\n      unable to give a better definition beyond a functional disturbance of the\\n      spinal and cerebral nerves, dependent on a morbid process, for which\\n      \"irritation\" is as proper a term as any. As deaths do not occur,\\n      autopsies throw no light on the subject. Briefly stated, neurasthenia,\\n      when observed from the beginning through its chronic course, has a period\\n      of prodromal symptoms followed by a protracted acute, and succeeded by a\\n      still more protracted chronic, state, between the end of which and the\\n      beginning of convalescence there is a very vague, often indiscernible,\\n      boundary line.\\n      \\n The prodromal symptoms are quite\\n      indefinite and very variable, pointing to nothing in particular. Loss of\\n      appetite, irregular sleep, excitability alternating with lassitude, etc.,\\n      are often overlooked, especially when the second stage-display of unusual\\n      mental and physical energy without subsequent fatigue- becomes apparent.\\n      This is often mistaken for a sign of unusually good health. When a young\\n      girl or mature woman, married or unmarried, feels that she can study ten\\n      hours a day and devote half of her night to pleasure or business; when\\n      besides much mental occupation she begins to rejoice in long walks without\\n      fatigue, that is the time when the mischief is going on without exciting\\n      timely suspicion. Relief is at last sought when the functional disorder of\\n      the nerves has gone to the opposite extreme, and becomes manifest in what\\n      is properly and popularly termed \"nervous prostration,\" when\\n      instead of having no sense of fatigue, the best bodily or mental effort\\n      seems intolerable, in grave cases rendering the patient a helpless being,\\n      completely dependent on the unremitting assistance of others whom she )it\\n      is usually a woman) rules with the inexorable power of the vis inertiae.\\n      \\n During this usually very protracted\\n      period of the disease convalescence usually sets in, but so imperceptibly\\n      that the physician alone can sometimes estimate its progress, which is\\n      unnoticeable to others towards whom the patient acts as she has for months\\n      or years. This is the time for action, too often delayed from motives of\\n      misplaced sympathy on the part of relatives and friends.\\n      \\n The affections is in many instances\\n      limited to the spine, the mind becoming only secondarily tired. In other\\n      cases it is spinal and cerebral; in others again chiefly cerebral. The\\n      line between this and insanity is always clearly definable. Though a\\n      neurasthenic patient may become insane, and probably the reverse, yet both\\n      are distinct conditions.\\n      \\n Books speak of this disease at common\\n      to men and women. Yet in this region in small towns as well as in large\\n      cities the cases of neurasthenia in women are preponderatingly great.\\n      \\n Hypochondriacs and hysteria stand in\\n      peculiar relation to neurasthenia. They maybe regarded as different\\n      species of the same genus; that is, more or less deeply seated\\n      disturbances of the cerebro-spinal system in which the sympathetic system\\n      is probably indirectly involved, as many functional disturbances presided\\n      over by the great sympathetic system often testify. Hypochondriasis, pure\\n      and simple as occurring in men, is easily distinguishable by its striking\\n      characteristic of introspection and despondency, occasioned by abnormal\\n      sensations, without marked physical weakness and tiredness. Pure\\n      hypochondriacs are often energetic, conscientious workers. In hysteria\\n      there is neither great tiredness nor tendency to introspection, but a\\n      paroxysmal or prolonged absence of the power of self control, in grave\\n      cases associated with tonic or clonic muscular spasm and loss of\\n      consciousness. While neurasthenia in its uncomplicated forms is free from\\n      these symptoms, but, as ample experience teaches, often complicated with\\n      both of the preceding forms to such an extent that it is often very\\n      difficult to tell which is primary and which secondary. The symptoms known\\n      as introspection, hysterical aberrations of the emotions, and neurasthenic\\n      sense of exhaustion are in their distinctive manifestations most important\\n      and constitute indications in the selection of remedial and dietetic\\n      measures.\\n      \\n The following are some observation of\\n      peculiarities observed in a large number of cases and peculiar to all:.\\n      \\n Introspection.-The neurasthenic patient\\n      in variably expresses her desire for relief, not so much in a direct\\n      appeal as in a supplicating, subdued tone of voice and manner. She rarely\\n      asks, \"What can you do to relieve me?\" but almost invariably,\\n      \"What is the cause of\" this or that sensation? If she is\\n      introspective, that is, hypochondriacal, she becomes a nosomaniac,\\n      watching acutely every one of her numerous distressing sensation, on the\\n      unremitting analysis of which her mind dwells. In marked cases she is\\n      quite unable to think of anything outside of herself, and in many cases\\n      dislikes to do so, preferring to river her attention on herself. Attempts\\n      to divert her annoy or anger her. Friends and relatives implore the\\n      physician to divert the patient, but all their attempts are in vain\\n      because quite misdirected.\\n      \\n Positive and Negative Will.-It seems\\n      sometimes as if the patient delights in her self-inspection, and that she\\n      prefers her condition to speedy recovery. This is not the case, for the\\n      patient will always assure the physician of her wish to get well. During\\n      the acute stage-a long yet definable period-this wish and longing cannot\\n      well be utilized, but the long and ill-defined period of convalescence\\n      must first be awaited. Here we shall always discover that the wish and the\\n      will of the patient are two very different mental conditions. The desire\\n      or wish for recovery is entirely unattended by any will effort to\\n      accomplish the desired end. The injunctions and directions of the\\n      physician are resisted by the same unconquerable power of negative power,\\n      or vis inertiae. The patient having been unable to exert her will, now\\n      thinks herself unable to use it.\\n      \\n Numerous Symptoms of Patients.-To\\n      physicians in search of indications for medicines each statement of\\n      patient concerning a sensation is apt to be considered as a symptom. Many\\n      years ago, when resolved to get at the keynote of a patient\\'s case, the\\n      writer determined to allow the patient to detail all her symptoms as long\\n      as she chose and to take accurate notes of each one till the right one\\n      should be disclosed; and this was to be done regardless of time and\\n      exertion. The patient, one who needed no urging to describe her\\n      \"symptoms,\" began in an almost inaudible voice, detailing one\\n      sensation after another with an unrivalled degree of clearness and\\n      vividness of expression; as she proceeded the voice became stronger, her\\n      face slightly flushed, and the most perfect descriptive language flowed in\\n      an endless stream. Each word was written down, page after page was filled;\\n      still she went on with unmistakable signs of satisfaction at being able to\\n      pour her pent-up emotions into willing and sympathetic ears. If, for a\\n      moment, the flow of language was interrupted, a simple question would\\n      re-animate her to proceed with renewed energy. Feelings seemed to beget\\n      feelings; their complexity gave the patient no trouble; her intellect was\\n      equal to the action of unraveling the most complicated sensation,\\n      separating them into their component parts and spreading them out before\\n      the mind of the listener. A glance at the watch showed that nearly two\\n      hours had passed, during which the feeblest of neurasthenic patients had\\n      talked incessantly. The note-book was full, the keynote was found. It was\\n      this: neurasthenic patients have innumerable sensation and exhibit no\\n      sings of fatigue after talking incessantly for nearly two hours.\\n      \\n Great Endurance of Neurasthenics.-The\\n      instance just related, which is one of many, illustrates two things. One\\n      is, that it is not the kind of sensation described but the fact that\\n      neurasthenics have innumerable sensations, that constitute the symptoms.\\n      The other thing is that many neurasthenics are capable of great exertion\\n      without suffering disagreeable after- effects from fatigue. This is\\n      illustrated by other cases of which I have notes. A highly neurasthenic\\n      young lady consented to camp out for her health near a lake. She was\\n      induced to join a party for a short walk along the lake. By trying what\\n      they thought a shorter road the party lost their way and took a very long\\n      walk of about four hours, through bogs and over forces. The neurasthenic\\n      was less fatigued than some of the others. The interesting observation was\\n      subsequently made that the patient had become interested in a young man of\\n      the party. She recovered her health within a year from that time. Other\\n      cases of this kind will appear under the head of therapeutic suggestions.\\n      \\n Neurasthenic Patients Crave\\n      Sympathy.-This is one of the most formidable obstacles to the curative\\n      management of such cases, for the kind of sympathy such patients crave is\\n      expressions of condolence and more or less deep affliction at so much\\n      suffering as the patient expresses. Such sympathy is most natural and does\\n      honor to the feelings of parents, sisters, brothers and husbands, but it\\n      is unfortunate that the deeper their expression of affliction so much the\\n      more profound will be the mental dejection and weakness of the patient.\\n      Almost every case which has come under the writer\\'s observation has been\\n      much hampered if not made hopeless by this condition of things, against\\n      which no remedy suggests itself that would not be construed as\\n      \"unkind\".\\n      \\n The origin of this very formidable and\\n      refractory nervous disease, like that of most diseases usually termed\\n      chronic, is either hereditary or acquired, as the histories of every\\n      observed case plainly testify. Either the father was a hypochondriac or\\n      the mother neurasthenic, or both parents were of unsound nervous\\n      constitution. Dipsomania on the part of parents produces neurasthenia in\\n      the children, as readily as it will be followed by any other form of\\n      nervous disease, according to the individual predisposition of the\\n      offspring. The excessive use of tea and coffee is another very active\\n      factor in the history of neurasthenics. Where fathers inclined to alcohol,\\n      mothers are addicted to tea and coffee, which, while its immediate effects\\n      do not obtrude themselves upon our notice, are none the less insidious in\\n      their more remote consequences.\\n      \\n The acquired forms of neurasthenia are\\n      of utmost interest to the therapeutist, and the sources of acquisition are\\n      readily stated. They are much brain-work with insufficient food and sleep.\\n      Such conditions obtain chiefly in women (less frequently in men) of fine\\n      intellectual ability, conscientiousness and ambition. Physical overwork\\n      with unintellectual women has no such effect. Quite analogous to the above\\n      are the conditions of care and sorrow, especially in women who are able\\n      for a long time to conceal and control their emotions. The usual\\n      consequence of such states of mind is disregard of food and insufficient\\n      sleep. Instances of acquired neurasthenia are presented in families of\\n      several girls and boys, where one or more of the former are Neurasthenic\\n      while the latter are vigorous and athletic. Boys delighting in vigorous\\n      exercise do not, as is the case with girls, lose appetite and sleep.\\n      \\n The effects of nervous exhaustion in\\n      boys are usually much less grave than in girls; as a rule such effects are\\n      manifested in mental, not muscular, tiredness, and they are relieved by\\n      air and exercise, while in girls and women those influences are shunned\\n      because they seem to increase the tiredness.\\n      \\n Predisposition-The temperament, or what\\n      in modern pharaseology is called the personal equation, plays a visible\\n      but uncontrollable part in the progress of neurasthenia, as temperament\\n      greatly determines the other imperfectly known condition known as\\n      predisposition. Where the disease is hereditary, it is easy to say that\\n      the predisposition is due to that source; where there is no history of\\n      heredity and where neurasthenia exists in the last members of a\\n      generation, it may be attributed to acquired predisposition which needed\\n      only the exciting cause to establish the disease in its most typical form.\\n      \\n One of the most common forms of\\n      neurasthenia, often quite intractable, results from a serious defect in\\n      our public school system, one which affects chiefly girls from twelve to\\n      fourteen years of age. The following is a brief example: The child rises\\n      late with no appetite for breakfast and no time to eat it if so inclined.\\n      The lessons, however, have been learned the evening before, and the school\\n      work is begun with an ambitions will and a crammed mind, and continues\\n      with one intermission of often not more than ten minutes or three of four\\n      hours. The pupil arrives at home ravenously hungry, eats too fast, and too\\n      much of injudiciously prepared food, too long in digesting to leave room\\n      for an appetite for even a light evening meal, or even for a breakfast the\\n      next morning.\\n      \\n In another case the girl or boy grows\\n      desperately hungry while at school, but being unprovided with food\\n      (lunch), goes on with the school exercises, at the end of which the sense\\n      of hunger has vanished and has been replaced by an aversion to normal\\n      food, with a possible craving for something pungent and indigestible. This\\n      observation can easily be made in many instances, and will, in as many\\n      cases, be seen to lead to nervous prostration, which is then treated by\\n      vile, patented concoctions consisting largely of whiskey, under the name\\n      of \"tonics,\" while the patient needs only the best that a\\n      legitimate market affords prepared in a sensible manner.\\n      \\n Typical Cases Ending in Rapid\\n      Recovery.-Curative results have already been indicated in what has been\\n      said above, and further indications for treatment may be gathered from a\\n      few cases of extremely rapid recovery of apparently incurable cases, to\\n      which brief allusion will here be made. A woman of forty had been a victim\\n      of grave neurasthenia for five years. In the absence of an inclination to\\n      exert himself, she had, during that period, been mostly confined to her\\n      bed or lounge, in the meantime giving birth to two children, going through\\n      gestation and confinement normally, without recovering from neurasthenic\\n      prostration which, in the course of some years more, rendered her entirely\\n      helpless. Her condition was associated with a feeling of dropping to\\n      pieces unless supported and braced by a harness of wood, iron and leather,\\n      in which she \"sat up\" for several hours each day, spending the\\n      rest of the time in bed. Having left the patient in this condition, it was\\n      reported before the writer\\'s next professional visit that Mrs.-had been\\n      cured, and that she was able to go out like other people. A visit to the\\n      house confirmed the report. The patient came to the door herself, and in a\\n      quiet manner, entirely without the least expression of joy or wonder at\\n      her release, stated, that having heard of a famous \"magnetic\\n      physician,\" she summoned him, was ordered by him to arise and stand;\\n      protesting that it was impossible, she was raised to her feet and again\\n      ordered to stand, then to walk. Fearing that she would fall, she begged\\n      the magnetic doctor to support her, which he peremptorily refused, saying\\n      she might fall if she liked. Instead of falling, she had to walk about the\\n      room, was then placed upon a lounge and subjected to a severe treatment of\\n      rolling and pummelling, and then ordered to dress and sit up until tired,\\n      to remain up and about like other people, and to call on the doctor in\\n      future, as he would not come so far to the patient again. This happened\\n      about twenty-five years ago, and the patient has been in very fair health\\n      arrested by insisting that all professional visits by the writer or any\\n      other physician to whose sympathy the patient could appeal must cease.\\n      This injunction was carried out conscientiously with the best results by\\n      the husband of the patient. Perhaps we may learn from this that sometimes,\\n      at least, the familiar motto is reversed, and angels rush in where fools\\n      fear to tread.\\n      \\n Profiting by this experience, another\\n      neurasthenic woman, unmarried, but of most intractable, antagonistic\\n      temperament, confined to her bed, in and out of hospitals, for years,\\n      wearing out the strength and means of her relatives and the patience of\\n      many physicians, was at length abandoned by them. It was a case of spinal\\n      and cerebral neurasthenia complicated with hypochondriasis in its most\\n      trying form of introspective maunderings and endless description of\\n      symptoms. She tormented her advisers by her endless tirades, the\\n      indulgence of which invariably aggravated her condition, and were there\\n      fore avoided, until once her physician yielded to the patient\\'s\\n      importunities for a visit, when be found her in her usual abject state of\\n      prostration. Guided by experience derived from cases like the one first\\n      described, he assisted the patient to her feet and marched her, will you\\n      nil you, up and down the room until he, at least, was thoroughly tired,\\n      and then departed with the promise never to do so again. The patient, on\\n      her part, made a number of her unnameable promises, but kept on her feet\\n      and let the doctors alone. Though not cured of deeply-rooted morbid mental\\n      faults, the neurasthenic phase of her condition had yielded to the change\\n      of the antagonistic element of her character from passive to very\\n      practical activity. A third very serious case of this kind occurred in the\\n      person of a girl of fifteen, of selfish character, who gradually became\\n      bed-ridden with spinal and cerebral neurasthenia, and tormented with the\\n      usual multifarious painful sensations, none of which, on the most\\n      pains-taking physical examination, resulted from demonstrable organic\\n      disease of genital or abdominal organs. The patient was most tenderly\\n      cared for by her mother, who, in the course of years, became so imbued\\n      with the idea of yielding to every wish and whim of the patient, that at\\n      length remonstrance became useless. The mother, though recognizing the\\n      importance of persuading or urging her daughter to depend more on herself,\\n      admitted that she had yielded so long that now she must continue to feed,\\n      dress and assist her charge in the most trivial things. Her food had to be\\n      placed in her mouth, the position of a hand or foot changed by some one\\n      else, although patient did so spontaneously when she chose. This went on\\n      for fifteen years, when the mother, growing old and feeble, died. Her\\n      maternal support being gone, the patient at once proved her ability to\\n      walk, to dress, to feed herself, and to seek light employment. Though far\\n      from well, she is equally far fro being a helpless, bed-ridden invalid.\\n      \\n A fourth case, still very vividly\\n      impressed on the writer\\'s mind, was one of a healthy, romping girl of 14,\\n      who, as happen in this remarkably capricious disease, in the midst of\\n      perfect health, one day took to her bed and remained there with all the\\n      symptoms of neurasthenia, involving first the spinal and finally the\\n      cerebral nerves. This patient was very amiable, conscientious, and\\n      sensible, never loquacious, and not troubled with hypochondriacal thoughts\\n      or sensations. Tiredness was the only expression she used in describing\\n      her feelings. There was literally no variation from this condition, which\\n      confined her to her bed for years, till she grew from a girl to a woman.\\n      Eating and sleeping well, and improving perceptibly in personal appearance\\n      and character, yet she lay on her couch tired and watched over with\\n      unremitting care by a most anxious mother, showing her solicitude and\\n      sympathy in every feature. Once, in the second year of the disease, a\\n      favorable interruption occurred. The mother, still a young woman, gave\\n      birth to another child. During her confinement the neurasthenic patient\\n      was in charge of her mother\\'s nurse, assisted by other servants. The\\n      nurse, while devoted to the daughter, agreed with the writer that excess\\n      of sympathy was injurious, and used her best and judicious endeavors\\n      gradually to persuade the patient to make some physical effort at walking\\n      and standing. In this she was so successful that in two weeks she\\n      accompanied the girl on half-mile walks up and down hill, finally without\\n      assistance. Thus, recovery seemed assured, and everything was favorable\\n      progressing towards it when the mother, having fully recovered, again took\\n      charge of her daughter, with the result that she at once took to her\\n      lounge and remained there two years longer. About that time other advice\\n      was urged and gladly acceded to, with the result that the case was\\n      diagnosed by an eminent surgeon as spinal paralysis in consequence of\\n      concussion, though it could never be shown when and where it occurred.\\n      Salves, plasters, anodynes, nervines, and electricity did no good, but\\n      effectually destroyed appetite and digestion, which higher to had been\\n      normal. So this adviser resigned in favor of a third, who, being a younger\\n      and less prejudiced man, agreed perfectly with the writer\\'s original\\n      opinion. He advised return to moderate exercise, avoidance of drugs, and\\n      less display of sympathy. This, though formerly rejected as\\n      \"unkind,\" was now acceded to as coming from a nerve- specialist,\\n      fresh from Europe, at that time very rare. Still attending the other\\n      members of the family, the writer had sample opportunity of observing the\\n      course of the case. Improvement was very slow and uncertain till financial\\n      misfortune overtook the family. Almost with a bound our patient left her\\n      cough, and, organizing a kindergarten, strove energetically in supporting\\n      herself and assisting her mother. The change came about in less than three\\n      weeks, and resulted in perfect recovery.\\n      \\n At this point another very instructive\\n      case of very speedy recovery, after six or seven years of neurasthenic\\n      prostration, deserves to be mentioned. A woman of 35 had been in bed and\\n      on the lounge most of the time for nearly seven years, at the end of which\\n      time she became my patient, her regular medical attendant having gone to\\n      Europe. She was of very amiable disposition and as sensitive as she was\\n      weak. Her symptoms, as in the other cases, were instantaneous exhaustion\\n      on the least physical exertion. She could give herself up to no mental\\n      occupation beyond directing her house-hold affairs, the education of her\\n      son, and the rehearsal of her numerous sensations. She had not been my\\n      patient long when her husband failed in business, so that the family was\\n      reduced from very comfortable circumstances to a condition which made it\\n      necessary for the patient to make her own living and that of the family.\\n      This she almost at once proceeded to do, setting aside all other\\n      considerations and establishing a boarding-house, where she did most of\\n      the work herself. This she has done now for ten or twelve years without a\\n      serious relapse. The time involved in the period of convalescence was\\n      scarcely more than three weeks, a although her work maybe said to have\\n      begun at the moment her resolution was taken.\\n      \\n Prognostics.-From these and other cases\\n      in and outside of the writer\\'s practice, it is safe to say that the\\n      majority of cases of neurasthenia recover, though years may elapse before\\n      that period. We learn, furthermore, that recoveries, especially of very\\n      inveterate cases, depend on conditions beyond the control of the\\n      physician, as was the case in the above-recorded instances, where\\n      circumstances forced the patient to cases to wish for recovery and to make\\n      an effort of the will. This having been once accomplished self-confidence,\\n      for a long time in abeyance, was permanently restored.\\n      \\n Curability, further, depends very much\\n      on the temperament of the patient, whether amiable, tractable and\\n      confiding in the honest endeavors of the physician, or whether refractory,\\n      suspicious, untruthful, selfish and antagonistic, of a disposition\\n      impossible to win over on account of unnatural distrust of every\\n      well-meaning person. The degree of intelligence of patients also has a\\n      pronounced influence on the result. The most readily curable cases are\\n      those acquired without hereditary predisposition, where the cause is found\\n      in the absence of food and sleep, also where sorrow and anxiety can be\\n      averted or counteracted by judicious conduct of near relatives and\\n      friends.\\n      \\n Dietetic Treatment.-This, as medicinal\\n      treatment, must be governed by the stage at which the case comes into the\\n      physician\\'s hands-whether yet in its prodromal, its acute or its chronic\\n      phase. The prodromal stage of the disease has no very decided\\n      pathognomonic signs. The most that can be recognized in this stage is that\\n      the patient\\'s habits or duties are of a kind which will eventually lead to\\n      obdurate neurasthenia if not arrested in time by removing the exciting\\n      causes. Too much pleasure, as well as too much care, especially in girls\\n      and woman, tends to neglect of food and rest, in the absence of which,\\n      excitements, whether of pleasure or care, begets a state of unrest in\\n      which repose is disagreeable. With such a condition comes a list of\\n      incipient casual complaints of headache, imperfect sleep, notional ways of\\n      eating, working or playing. A few questions will determine whether the\\n      patient is living according to normal or abnormal habits with regard to\\n      appetite, sleep and occupation. Where these are found, their alteration to\\n      normal ways must be instead on. It is unnecessary to say that this is\\n      easier said than done, for it will probably meet with serious objections\\n      on the part of the patient, if not on that of her relatives; for most\\n      likely she has examinations for college to prepare for, involving several\\n      months of dose and careful study at night, and the patient cannot waste\\n      time in sleeping and eating while cramming that little excited and\\n      ambitions brain. A failure in the examinations would be as much of a\\n      disappointment to parents as to patient, who proves, as usual, that this\\n      appellation is a misnomer. She accordingly goes in as she please, lied by\\n      an increasing morbidly ambitions impulse, and the result is likely to be\\n      the mournful satisfaction on the part of the physician of being obliged to\\n      say, \"I told you before what would happen.\" Of course, all\\n      regret the now evident nerve-prostration, while, if the doctor had\\n      succeeded in enforcing his rules, he would in many cases experience the\\n      still more painful reproach of having been too severe. Nevertheless,\\n      absolute firmness and a kindly but unflinching exertion of his will,\\n      without the least compromise, reward the physician with the best results\\n      in such cases.\\n      \\n When the case, after the stage of\\n      excitement and untiring restlessness (at which it would still be speedily\\n      curable by simple dietetic rules) has, after weeks or months, entered upon\\n      the phase of painful prostration, here we encounter backache, oppressive\\n      headache, and absolute loss of mental or bodily endurance, measures of\\n      dietetic management are much less effective and much more difficult to\\n      find. it is at this stage that slight rise of temperature will occur,\\n      especially towards evening; then the backache and headache disappear, the\\n      pallor is replaced by a flush of color, the eyes lose their listless look,\\n      and the patient is inclined to enter upon some diversion or excitement,\\n      followed by a restless night and a morning of exhaustion and a renewal of\\n      all painful sensations. Most of such patients feel much better in the\\n      evening when they are ready for some entertainment, while in a normal\\n      state this would be the time for relaxation and repose.\\n      \\n The dietetic treatment of this stage is\\n      methodical rest. In severe cases the patient will do well to remain in bed\\n      for several days or even for weeks. It is well to shorten this period as\\n      much as possible and to insist on walking about, or, at least. sitting for\\n      a specified time every day. This may be varied b equally specified periods\\n      of rest in the recumbent position.\\n      \\n Irregularities of eating are at this\\n      and at all times to be superseded by the most rigid regularity of meals.\\n      The traditional and conventional three-meal system, however well adapted\\n      to the needs of a vigorous man or woman, does not agree with the\\n      neurasthenic patient. It is much better that these should eat oftener;\\n      four times a day is best in most cases, for the simple reason that in this\\n      way a patient, while eating less at a time, consumes more food in the\\n      aggregate.\\n      \\n As neurasthenic patients are rarely\\n      troubled with absolute aversion to wholesome food, they are generally able\\n      to consume a liberal quantity, about which it is only needful to remark\\n      here that the food should be selected from among the articles and dishes\\n      which the patient likes, provided they belong to the order of good, normal\\n      articles of food, to the exclusion of those which simply please the taste\\n      without being digestible. A dish entirely of meat or \"animal\\n      food\" is as far from being a good diet for neurasthenics as one\\n      consisting entirely of \"vegetable\" food. As a rule, the diet\\n      list should comprise one-third of nitrogenous material and two-thirds of\\n      carbohydrates. Together with these, it is a great mistake to neglect the\\n      fats, such as good butter and the fats of meats. And, lastly, every\\n      patient of this kind should be made to drink some water often, a dietetic\\n      feature too often neglected.\\n      \\n During this stage, actually fatiguing\\n      exercise of body and mind should be avoided, while, on the other hand, the\\n      patient\\'s mind should be directed away from herself, in which she is much\\n      assisted by withholding a certain kind of emotional sympathy, quite as\\n      natural as it is difficult to repress on the part of affectionate persons.\\n      Of this, a few words further on.\\n      \\n There is no definite time for the\\n      duration of this stage, which, however, depends largely on the time during\\n      which the exciting causes have acted, either aided by or without a\\n      predisposition. It is certain, however, that the sooner it is recognized\\n      and the exciting causes eliminated, so much the sooner recovery will\\n      begin. But there is a stage at which the best of experience and judgment\\n      often fail, especially in very inveterate cases. If the case is one of a\\n      patient whom the physician has had opportunity of watching at least since\\n      the earlier stages, the difficulty is not so great as it is in old cases\\n      months or even of several years\\' duration which come to treatment late. In\\n      these, the line between the intermediate stage and incipient convalescence\\n      cannot be drawn. The patient is as neurasthenic and hypochondriacal as\\n      ever; cannot bear the slightest mental or bodily exertion, not even a word\\n      or a look, without sings of apparent exhaustion, while nearly the whole\\n      time is spent in bed under anxious care of sympathetic attendants. In such\\n      cases, having become assured, by careful physical examination, of the\\n      absence of organic disease, seeing the patient generally well nourished\\n      and in fair muscular condition, the physician is warranted in assuming\\n      that the disease has run its course, that whatever morbid (pathological)\\n      process there may have been progressing in the nervous system, this\\n      process has now come to and end, but it has left the patient\\'s mental\\n      condition habituated to the moods of the past months or years, and fixed,\\n      as it were, indelibly in the memory. It is the habit that now remains, not\\n      the disease.\\n      \\n If reasonably sure of this, and calling\\n      to mind the rapid recoveries and the circumstances attending them, as\\n      above detailed, the physician is now safe in ordering a more energetic\\n      treatment, calculated to rouse the self-reliance of the patient. All\\n      visible signs of sympathy must now be set aside; the actins and demeanor\\n      of the attendants should, from this time, if not before, be changed so as\\n      to give the patient the impression that she is no longer an invalid, but\\n      expected to rely on her own exertion. Instead of being fed, the food\\n      should be placed where she must go for and eat it. She should now be\\n      expected to dress and attend, without assistance, to her natural wants.\\n      This, with some temperaments, is almost impossible, with al extremely\\n      difficult. The best course to pursue is to remove such patients from\\n      sympathetic relatives or friends, and to place them in charge of kind,\\n      reliable, but eminently practical nurses.\\n      \\n The first effect of this is either to\\n      throw the patient into a stage of helpless despondency, which, again\\n      appealing powerfully to the sympathies of those nearest to her, often\\n      frustrates the physician\\'s plans which, if firmly but kindly adhered to,\\n      would, ere long, prove of their superiority by signs of returning\\n      self-reliance and absence of complaints on the part of the patient. A\\n      second form of effect is that occurring in patients of obstreperous,\\n      selfish disposition, whose opposition and even anger is aroused by being\\n      thrown on their own resources after the removal of depressing and\\n      unpractical sympathy. This opposition or temper, often manifested in all\\n      sorts of intrigues and subterfuges on the part of the patient, if not\\n      supinely yielded to by sympathetic persons, will finally be replaced by a\\n      more rational disposition. On the whole, anger or active opposition are\\n      signs of returning energy, which, once coming to the consciousness of the\\n      patient, takes the form of self- reliance. it is this way that the cures\\n      of chronic cases above related can be explained, and physicians should\\n      profit by such experience for the benefit of their patients.\\n      \\n The general dietetic management now\\n      readily follows from what has been said, and needs only a few general\\n      modifications. The first duty of the physician will be to test the degree\\n      of reliance to be placed on the patient and her friends, ad to win them\\n      over if possible to his plans, and his success will be in proportion to\\n      the degree of confidence he is able to inspire. This personal confidence\\n      should not degenerate into a mere personal liking or attachment of a\\n      sympathy-craving neurasthenic who should discover henceforth that all\\n      sentimental expressing of sympathy are about to take a practical form,\\n      aiming at a definite result-the patient\\'s health-which she wishes but\\n      cannot exert her will to attain. The best and often the only way to do\\n      away with sentiment and to reach practical kindness is to remove the\\n      patient from certain home influence, and to place her in a hospital or\\n      elsewhere under the management of competent nurses who, without being\\n      selfish, know how to exert a certain amount of wholesome push as fast as\\n      the patient can bear it. Without the removal of sentimental sympathy, all\\n      efforts at counteracting the purely hypochondriacal side of neurasthenia\\n      are useless.\\n      \\n In these cases of neurasthenia as yet\\n      uncomplicated with the hypochondriacal element of introspective nosomania,\\n      there is only one unconditional rule to be followed, especially in\\n      acquired cases whose evident cause was incessant, conscientious work of\\n      mind and body, together with insufficient food and sleep. Such cases come\\n      on very insidiously, the loss of strength-that is, the actual waste of\\n      nerve-substance-being just a trifle grater than the quantity restored, the\\n      patient unconsciously using up a minute part of her capital every day.\\n      Here the rule should be to reverse matters to insuring a supply of\\n      nourishment and time for its assimilation greater than was the case\\n      heretofore. The case of young school-girls belong in this class. The time\\n      of food and rest should be carefully controlled at home, the duty of the\\n      physician being to educate indifferent and ignorant parents up to an\\n      appreciation of the nature of the case. It is generally not difficult to\\n      open their eyes through the medium of their anxiety concerning their\\n      children\\'s health. Having thus insured sufficient rest and food at home,\\n      the physician\\'s next object of attention should be the regulations of the\\n      school. Here is the point where teachers have an opportunity of exerting\\n      their most practical influence. It should be made obligatory on the part\\n      of teachers to institute inquiry as to whether pupils have had their meals\\n      before coming to school. This they could often ascertain without a\\n      question, by reading the pupil\\'s condition in her emaciated form, pale\\n      face and nervous manner. To guard against neglect at home, it would be an\\n      easy matter to insist that all pupils of public and private schools should\\n      bring with them some proper food. The few who do so generally bring\\n      sweets-an apple, orange or a few dry crackers-when a piece of good bread\\n      and slice of cold meat would be what they actually need. All pupils should\\n      pass inspection, and if remiss in this important particular, the\\n      delinquent should be dismissed with several marks against her. To expect\\n      this of teachers would be a great advance in the place of futile\\n      innovations of endeavoring to send forth from our common schools graduates\\n      in arts and sciences.\\n      \\n Sudden Effects.-A large number of cases\\n      of neurasthenia, especially those complicated with inveterate\\n      Hypochondriasis, are frequently traced to some sudden occurrence, having\\n      the effect of a mental or physical shock. In one patient, a vigorous girl,\\n      used to romping, climbing and running lie a boy, the cause was supposed to\\n      be a slight thump she received during a game of blindman\\'s-buff. She\\n      thought nothing of it at the time, but it was suggested long after the\\n      patient\\'s illness began. In another case some mental shock of joy or\\n      grief, not very severe and such as is often experienced in every person\\'s\\n      life, is the beginning of months of nervous prostration.\\n      \\n There is quite an array of evidence\\n      that neurasthenia which has entered upon a hypochondriacal stage or\\n      complication with or without a strong hysterical admixture, is curable by\\n      sudden impressions in the form of a shock, or more gradually by frequent\\n      repetitions of an impression. Such cases, as I have shown above, occur\\n      most commonly in the stage when what may be considered the essential\\n      pathological disturbances of function have run their course and have left\\n      the patient in a state of mental disturbance which indicated that the\\n      patient\\'s recovery depends entirely upon her volition. But there is none,\\n      and so far nothing has succeeded in arousing it. Persuasion is as useless\\n      and irritating, as argument would be in a case of insanity with a fixed\\n      illusion. The resemblance between this and the state of mind of a\\n      hypochondriacal neurasthenic is very close. She cannot move nor thick.\\n      Exhaustion overcomes her and keeps her its victim for years, when suddenly\\n      the scene changes, and a few days or weeks suffice to restore the patient\\n      to activity. In one instance it is attributed to medical, in another to\\n      \"mind cure,\" in a third to \"Christian science;\" in\\n      still other cases massage has done it, in others again \"magnetic\\n      influence,\" in others the very powerful factor necessity. It is\\n      certain that cases of this kind, produced by sudden effects on the mind of\\n      a predisposed person, are also cured by such effects. Whatever the visible\\n      form of these effects may be -whether that of \"Christian\\n      science,\" joy, grief or absolute inexorable necessity, there is\\n      always to be noticed a certain force and condition involving the modern\\n      idea of suggestion, which comes to the patient in an irresistible degree\\n      and now sets the function of the will in motion again.\\n      \\n Experience teaches that it is by no\\n      means a matter of indifference which of these forms of effect are brought\\n      into action. In one case it is the professional Christian scientist\\'s\\n      method, in another the almost brutal exertion of a person\\'s will combined\\n      with some physical force. In either case the patient is aroused from his\\n      inertia, and discovers his powers of mental and bodily ability to act.\\n      \\n A deplorable result is that recoveries\\n      after such effects are attributed in the popular mind to supernatural\\n      causes. That such is not the case may be gathered form instances occurring\\n      in very sensible and intelligent patients, whose reason is scarcely ever\\n      so far disturbed and weakened that they do not resent the proposition of\\n      trying, e.g., Christian science or mind cure.\\n      \\n Nevertheless, it is the mind cure which\\n      the intelligent patient needs quite as much as the ignorant and\\n      superstitious person; the difference is only the form in which the\\n      influencing force is applied. While in one case it is obedience to the\\n      candidly expressed instructions of the physician, in the other case the\\n      result is the to mystification. In either case it is the powerful stimulus\\n      of hope and aroused confidence that recovery will be realized.\\n      \\n The definition of suggestion does not\\n      fully cover the meaning, because the influence employed is greater than\\n      mere suggestion. The physician\\'s plan of action should be straightforward\\n      assurance of recovery, a direct appeal to hope, and an unceasing endeavor\\n      to arouse the self-reliance of the patient, not so much by verbal\\n      exhortations as by a manner and department from which the patient learns\\n      more readily than from words what is expected. If the attitude of the\\n      physician is appreciated, and seconded by the relatives and attendants, a\\n      favorable result is much more certain to follow.\\n      \\n Hypnotism is not advisable. There are\\n      now existing ancient neurasthenic invalids dating from the times of\\n      spiritualism when they were famous \"mediums.\" Hypnotism weakness\\n      the will and nervous endurance, and produces a predisposition to emotional\\n      nervousness with an intractable erotic admixture. The suggestions sought\\n      to be instilled into a hypnotized patient amount to nothing. The mental\\n      influence of mystical treatment administered while the patients is awake\\n      is much more powerful in awaking hope and confidence than the uncertain\\n      effects of an abnormal state like that of hypnotism. Mystification, again,\\n      though sometimes unavoidable with the best intention, is less powerful\\n      than direct and intelligible encouragement. While resort to mystification\\n      should be shunned by reputable physicians, the question arises as to what\\n      shall be done with the many who, from lack of intelligence or education,\\n      are entirely beyond the reach of honest common sense, and who will persist\\n      in mystifying themselves, who remain neurasthenic invalids in spite of the\\n      best regulations of the physician, and who do not recover unless their\\n      encouragement follows some mystical formalities which alone arouse their\\n      \"faith\" and finally their confidence and will-power. For the\\n      present there is no way out of the dilemma but to submit such patients to\\n      the suggestive methods of what is popularly known as mind cure and\\n      Christian science. In doing so, physicians should use their influence as\\n      far as possible in selecting the most honest persons of this class.\\n      \\n DISCUSSION.\\n      \\n JAMES C. WOOD, M.D.: I have nothing but\\n      words of praise for Dr. Wesselhoeft\\'s excellent paper. It is very evident\\n      that the author\\'s inspiration came not from books but from actual contact\\n      with neurasthenic subjects, for the impress of originality is most\\n      conspicuous. It is a production which could only come from one of\\n      experience and from a reasoner. I consider it a most valuable contribution\\n      to the literature of that now most interesting subject,\\n      \"neurasthenia\".\\n      \\n The doctor, in his paper, has sometimes\\n      used the term \"neurasthenia\" instead of\\n      \"neurasthenia.\" The first of these means, according to Thomas,\\n      great nervous power or excitement; the second, nervous debility. I taken\\n      it from the context that the subject dealt with is neurasthenia. To the\\n      average mind there exists what seems to me a needless confusion regarding\\n      the terms, nervous prostration, hysteria and hystero-neurosis. As I\\n      understand these terms they define distinct conditions, though there is a\\n      frequent blending the one with the other. The term nervous prostration,\\n      which is a synonym of neurasthenia, defines itself; the term hysteria\\n      should be restricted to those general neuroses characterized particularly\\n      by psychical manifestations, though not infrequently by motor, sensory,\\n      secretory, vasomotor and reflex derangements as well; while the term\\n      hysteroneurosis implies the uterine origin of symptoms manifesting\\n      themselves in organs remote from the uterus without structural changes in\\n      such organs, being the direct result of reflex nervous influence starting\\n      from the uterus. The last term does not occur in the paper under\\n      discussion. From the standpoint of a gynecologist I think that this is\\n      misleading.\\n      \\n Let us see why and how it is that these\\n      three conditions (I will not call them diseases) are so frequently\\n      associated. I think that all will admit the frequent occurrence in woman\\n      of reflex symptoms, the result of pelvic lesions. An irritation staring\\n      form the pelvis is conveyed to the genito-spinal centre, thence to any or\\n      all organs with which this centre communicates. The organ oftener involved\\n      than any other is the stomach. This is shown by the frequent occurrence of\\n      nausea and vomiting following conception. The nervous system may have been\\n      previously involved, but oftener it becomes so only after the nutrition is\\n      depraved, which, sooner or later, occurs if the pelvic lesion is not\\n      removed. The depraved blood fails to supply the nerve centres with that\\n      which they need to sustain them, and they become anaemic. Prostration is\\n      but a subjective manifestation of the anaemia, and it varies in degree\\n      from a slight indisposition to the most abject helplessness.\\n      \\n If, then, nervous prostration may have\\n      its beginning in a pelvic lesion, is it possible for a pelvic lesion to be\\n      inaugurated by systemic disturbances? Personally, I believe that it is,\\n      and offer this explanation as the modus operandi by which such a lesion is\\n      induced: Marked circulatory changes nearly always attend nervous\\n      prostration. The circulation is presided over by the vaso-motor system,\\n      and wear and repair depend upon the proper regulation of this system. If\\n      it becomes disturbed, the bloodvessels dilate or contract unduly, with\\n      resulting local hyperaemia or local anaemia, as the case maybe. The\\n      climacteric flushes are the result of such disturbance. The alternate\\n      coldness and heat of the extremities, so often associated with rectal and\\n      uterine lesions, is another familiar illustration. If the brain is\\n      involved, either insomnia or drowsiness occur, depending upon whether the\\n      brain is anaemic or hyperaemic. Flatulence, gastralgia, and nervous\\n      dyspepsia result when the stomach is similarly affected. The womb and the\\n      ovaries, because of the periodical congestion imposed upon them, are\\n      oftener implicated by these unnatural circulatory disturbances than any of\\n      the pelvic organs, and in time also become unduly hyperaemic or anaemic,\\n      as the case may be.\\n      \\n It will thus be seen that nervous\\n      prostration may exist independently of pelvic lesions, or, conversely,\\n      pelvic lesions may exist independently of nervous prostration.\\n      Nevertheless, the two are frequently associated, and this fact ought, I\\n      believe, to be kept in mind in dealing with the affection known as\\n      neurasthenia. Hysterical manifestations nearly always come to the surface\\n      in nervous prostration, and they also frequently attend pelvic lesions.\\n      Indeed, the term \"hystero-psychosis\" has been coined for the\\n      purpose of defining certain psychical disturbances of presumably pelvic\\n      origin, and in the broadest sense neurasthenia is not uncommonly an\\n      hysteroneurosis. It is the frequent association of these three conditions\\n      which, it seems to me, makes it more practicable to study them conjointly.\\n      \\n The special symptoms of nervous\\n      prostration are most variable. Introspection, as Dr. Wesselhoeft has\\n      pointed out, makes of the patient a nosomaniac. The anaemic nerve centres\\n      are unduly impressionable, and a mental shock which would not seriously\\n      affect a stronger and more rugged woman falls with crushing force upon one\\n      whose nutrition is already depraved. In this way are developed disorders\\n      of sensibility, alternations of mobility, circulatory disturbances,\\n      anomalies of secretion and exertion, disorders of the gastro-intestinal\\n      canal, dermatoses, and general and psychical disturbances of all kinds.\\n      Many of these affections start from pelvic lesions, and are nearly always\\n      associated with depravity of nutrition and more or less nervous\\n      prostration.\\n      \\n Some of the worst symptoms of\\n      neurasthenia with which I have had to contend have been hyperaesthesia of\\n      the articulations, giving rise to the so-called \"hysterical\\n      joint.\" Here the prostration is usually not profound, and it is\\n      possible to apply the somewhat energetic treatment recommended by Dr.\\n      Wesselhoeft. I remember one case very distinctly, the detailed history of\\n      which I shall give in another place, which brought me much reputation\\n      because of the \"remarkable\" cure I was fortunate enough to make.\\n      \\n The patient, a beautiful girl of\\n      eighteen, had been bed- ridden for three years with supposed hip-joint\\n      disease. She was in college before assuming the ride of an invalid, and\\n      worried much over her studies and work. She sustained a fall a short time\\n      previously to taking to her bed, and to this fall the injury to the hip\\n      was attributed. She had been from physician to physician and from\\n      sanitarium to sanitarium without receiving benefit. All of the numerous\\n      medical men under whose care she had been, directed their attention to the\\n      hip and applied the classical treatment for morbus coxarius without avail.\\n      The patient had finally reached a point where introspection was her chief\\n      occupation and her mind dwelt almost continually upon a \"diseased\\n      hip.\" She was finally brought to me, coming in an invalid\\'s chair and\\n      looking the very picture of dependency. There was a slight degree of\\n      anaemia, though this was not marked. Notwithstanding the expression\\n      expression of abjectness the girl did not look seriously ill. The hip was\\n      excessively tender upon pressure, but there was no local increase of\\n      temperature, no evidences of fever and suppuration, and forcible\\n      apposition by striking the heel was not very painful. More less spastic\\n      contraction of the flexor muscles of the affected side existed, which gave\\n      to the limb an appearance of actual shortening, which was very deceptive.\\n      Hysterical symptoms were common. On examination I found the left ovary\\n      exquisitely tender. Compression of the ovary increased the pain in the hip\\n      most decidedly and gave rise to much nervous agitation. I did not,\\n      therefore, deem it wise to recommend local treatment other than the daily\\n      use of the hot douche. She had long been a victim of ovarian\\n      dysmenorrhoea. I placed upon the ankle of the affected limb three pounds\\n      of bar-lead, prescribed a pair of crutches and insisted upon her walking.\\n      The lead was used to overcome the spastic contraction as well as for its\\n      moral effect. I did not deem the joint lesion of such a character as to\\n      used extension. In two months\\' time this patient discarded her crutches\\n      for a cane. Six weeks later she put up the cane and is now perfectly well.\\n      \\n This was a case in which somewhat harsh\\n      measures were eminently appropriate.\\n      \\n In marked contrast to the case just\\n      recorded is the following: Mrs.-, aet. 47, widow for twenty years. She is\\n      a devoted church-woman, and for years was a leader in all charitable work\\n      done in the community in which she resided. Through friends she was urged\\n      to consult me, and I think that the call to the neighboring town in which\\n      she lived was countermanded at least four or five times before the finally\\n      mustered up courage and strength enough to see me. Upon reaching the\\n      bedside I found my patient in a room made dark by closed blinds, over\\n      which were hung heavy blankets to shut out every ray of light. The mirror\\n      was turned toward the wall for fear a ray of light might strike it and\\n      flesh throughout the darkened room. Nor did the patient rest under these\\n      extreme precautions, for the eyes were protected with two pairs of colored\\n      glasses with side attachments. Hyperaesthesia of the sense of hearing was\\n      equally marked and the noise was excluded from the room by double doors\\n      whose keyholes were stuffed with cotton. She l so had her ears filled with\\n      cotton, over which she wore ear-mufflers. She was emaciated to an extreme\\n      degree, and had been reduced to her miserable condition by a series of\\n      events which frequently precede profound neurasthenia. Her husband was\\n      killed during the war, and she was left childless. Twelve months previous\\n      to taking to her bed she nursed her mother through a long and fatal\\n      illness. This greatly prostrated her, yet she kept up until a favorite\\n      brother-in-law was thrown from a carriage and killed. This was the last\\n      straw, and the shock compelled her to take to her bed. In due time loss of\\n      appetite with irritability of the stomach developed, which, of course, led\\n      to marked depravity of nutrition. With the anaemia came hyperaesthesia of\\n      the special senses, spinal irritation, headache, hysterical\\n      manifestations, etc. There was no series pelvic lesion, although she had\\n      been much treated for an alleged uterine displacement with congestion.\\n      Unfortunately, she was encouraged, instead of discouraged, in her\\n      invalidism, and she soon became a nosomaniac of the worst type. She had\\n      written down her symptoms one at a time, and the record is such a typical\\n      one that I should like to give it in full, but time forbids.\\n      \\n With great difficulty the patient was\\n      moved on a cough to a private hospital and placed under the Weir Mitchell\\n      treatment. I ignored the pelvic trouble entirely. It is unnecessary to\\n      give in detail the progress of the case from day to day after this\\n      treatment was inaugurated. Suffice it to say that the improvement was of\\n      the most marked character, and in six weeks from the time she entered the\\n      hospital she walked to her carriage with her eyes and ears unprotected.\\n      She soon resumed her church and charitable work, in which she again takes\\n      much delight.\\n      \\n This woman wanted to get well. She was\\n      a woman of pure motives and high ideals. She had, in the language of Dr.\\n      Wesselhoeft, the wish, but, unaided, not the will. She required the aid of\\n      an intelligent, strong-minded, nurse who could bring to her exercise\\n      applied in such a way as to enable her to assimilate food without the\\n      expenditure of nerve force. She co- operated with her physician and nurse\\n      in every possible way, and as soon as the anaemic nerve cells became\\n      flushed with new blood she began to improve. To have commanded this\\n      patient \"to take up her bed and walk\" before improving her\\n      nutrition would have been as unscientific as to have placed the first\\n      patient in bed with extension and counter-extension applied to the limb. I\\n      know of no class of cases requiring for their successful treatment more\\n      tact and discrimination than that under consideration.\\n      \\n I feel confident that I have many times\\n      cut the affection short in its prodromal stage by removing the girl from\\n      college work and insisting upon open-air exercise. Static electricity has,\\n      in my hands, proved exceedingly useful both during the prodromal stage and\\n      that of convalescence.\\n      \\n I will conclude by saying that I have\\n      been impressed with the frequency with which an hereditary history of\\n      epilepsy has been met with in the cases of neurasthenia passing under my\\n      observation.'\n",
      " 'Tresorie - SOME OF THE DISEASES PREVENTING AND COMPLICATION PREGNANCY\\n[Diseases Preventing & Complicating Pregnancy]\\n\\n STERILITY.-DeSinety, Treub, Furbinger,\\n      et al., attribute 50 per cent. of unproductive marriages to the husbands,\\n      saying that sterility in the male is more often the cause of barren\\n      marriages than is generally supposed.\\n      \\n This cause of sterility I pass by, as\\n      also sterility due to mechanical obstruction, incomplete ovulation and the\\n      numerous other causes of this condition, too manifold for mere\\n      enumeration, to consider obesity as a causative agent in this condition. I\\n      need not say that the advocates for surgical interference for the relief\\n      of this condition are legion. Sims makes the assertion that sterility can\\n      be cured by surgical means only. That, of course, is Allopathic arguing\\n      pure and simple. Cases requiring surgical interference do arise, but any\\n      treatment which raises the nutrition of the entire organism, improves the\\n      blood-formation, and favors the resorption of pathological products in the\\n      sexual organs, is to be regarded as the indicated remedy.\\n      \\n Published statements are my authority\\n      for saying that excellent results have followed the administration of\\n      drugs, nevertheless; and in complete defiance of all therapeutic measures,\\n      a certain percentage of women remain barren; for with the more occult\\n      causes of sterility we remain, as yet, unacquainted, consequently they\\n      cannot all be reached with say kind of treatment whatever.\\n      \\n The following case I report somewhat in\\n      detail. Whilst not an exceptional case at all, it bears directly upon the\\n      subject under consideration, and possesses, it seems to me, some decidedly\\n      interesting features. My object in selecting this particular one is to\\n      call attention, if possible, to a condition not sufficiently considered.\\n      Mrs. J., aet. 26, married about two years and a half, appealed to my\\n      knowledge for a reason as to why she remained childless. The lady was\\n      carrying an excess of flesh, being under the medium height, and weighing\\n      186 pounds, but appeared to be in good health; family and previous history\\n      all that could be desired. Examination showed none of the common causes of\\n      sterility; neither, so far as I could ascertain, was the husband\\n      responsible for this unproductive condition of affairs. Some previous\\n      experiences of my own, with the added testimony of other and able men, was\\n      my reason for charging this condition of things to the excess of flesh,\\n      this, by the husband, being laughingly charged to excess of laziness.\\n      \\n We all, undoubtedly, are familiar with\\n      that peculiar disease of the blood-corpuscles which, whilst producing\\n      flesh, relaxes at the same time the muscular force; acting also, I\\n      believe, upon the muscular fibres of the uterus and upon the ovaries,\\n      inducing not only serious menstrual disorders but sterility. McKee,\\n      Philbert, and others give several instances of sterility chargeable to\\n      obesity, the women in question having been married several years without\\n      bearing children, and all became mothers after losing a portion of their\\n      flesh. If any other argument were needed in support of this theory we\\n      might turn to the quadrupeds, where we find the poorest breeders among the\\n      fleshiest animals. Fournel has a very able treatise on \"The Effects\\n      of Obesity on the Menstrual Functions and Parturition.\" Without\\n      having had any actual case of this description to deal with, he inclines\\n      very strongly towards the belief that obesity favors sterility. In the\\n      treatment of the case before mentioned, the patient was subjected to a\\n      daily massage of the entire body, with a special pelvic massage three\\n      times a week. This, in the main, consists in elevating the uterus as high\\n      as possible with the finger in the vagina, ending with a quick and decided\\n      vibratory motion. The diet received particular attention, as at this time\\n      there was a slight gastric ailment. The indicated remedy, Thuja, was given\\n      in the minimum dose. At the end of three months almost thirty pounds of\\n      flesh was gone, a considerable reduction. As an experiment, I recommended\\n      coitus in the knee-elbow position, advising that the lady remain quiet as\\n      long as possible after coition, with thighs well flexed. She became\\n      enciente, but miscarried at eight weeks. There was, comparatively\\n      speaking, but little pain and not much subsequent haemorrhage. She made a\\n      rapid recovery. Since then a living child has been born to them.\\n      \\n I believe I am safe in saying that this\\n      result would hardly have obtained were it not for the prophylactic\\n      measures adopted.\\n      \\n At the end of the first two months the\\n      patient was attacked with haemorrhage. A similar occurrence took place at\\n      irregular intervals during the following five months, the quantity of\\n      blood lost being much greater than that at the normal menstrual period.\\n      \\n For the greater part of the last five\\n      months she kept her bed, at the end of which time the tendency of the\\n      uterus to empty itself could be resisted no longer. A seven months\\' child\\n      was born, and is to-day doing well.\\n      \\n Pseudocyesis cerebral pregnancy,\\n      phantom pregnancy (whatever name we may call it by) is a disease which\\n      must come under the head of those \"complicating pregnancy.\" Mrs.\\n      M., a lady, married two or three years, aet. 29. Previous history good,\\n      always enjoying perfect health. When I first saw the lady in question she\\n      was a perfect picture of health, and, according to appearance and her own\\n      statements, about seven months pregnant. I made no examination. This\\n      appeared to be a thoroughly intelligent woman, and, according to her own\\n      statement, there was cessation of the menses. There certainly was an\\n      enlargement of the abdomen and breasts, a milky secretion, and the lady\\n      was sure that she felt foetal movement. On February 28th of the present\\n      year I was called to attend her in labor. Examination showed that no\\n      pregnancy existed. So far as I could ascertain there was no assignable\\n      origin for this condition other than nervous influences, the phenomena\\n      being purely muscular distension of the abdomen.\\n      \\n Mayham reports a case of a woman 73\\n      years old, claiming to be pregnant; he also claims that subsequently she\\n      was delivered of a child; this is an Allopathic report, however, of which\\n      we will take a Homoeopathic dose. Haultain reports three cases of cerebral\\n      pregnancy. In the first, he says no cause whatever was to be found; in the\\n      second, there was a small fibroid growth in the anterior uterine wall.\\n      Hauck reports a case where the vomiting, peristalsis, and flatus, caused\\n      by alcoholism were supposed to be caused by the pregnant state. Such cases\\n      are uncommon, but they emphasize the importance of making a thorough\\n      examination, in all cases where positive information is desired of the\\n      existence or non-existence of pregnancy.\\n      \\n Hyperemesis Gravidarum.-An animated\\n      discussion, held recently between two celebrated Allopaths of Stuttgart\\n      and Leipsic, has served to awaken a renewed interest in this subject,\\n      without in the least adding anything new to our stock of knowledge\\n      regarding its aetiology. Notwithstanding the frequency of the vomiting of\\n      pregnancy, its very distressing character in many instances, and its\\n      imminent, its very distressing character in many instances, and its\\n      imminent danger, we find but very few contributions of any value, to\\n      either the aetiology of the disorder or its therapeutics. I do not expect\\n      to add anything specially new myself, but it does seem to me that our\\n      knowledge of the vomiting of pregnancy, is to say the least, in a most\\n      contradictory state. Some physicians look upon it as a trifling matter,\\n      others as a thing to be endured, and some-these are in the right too-view\\n      even the mildest cases with gravity. Even in the mildest cases of morning\\n      sickness there is a constant drain upon the nervous system, putting the\\n      sufferer into a condition, in which she is very much less able to endure\\n      parturition than she would otherwise have been.\\n      \\n Dr. Harrison Mettler says: \"After\\n      careful inquiry I find that women who suffer from much morning sickness\\n      have as a rule, tedious or otherwise troublesome labors. I have observed\\n      in multiparae that at one time they will have much nausea and vomiting\\n      followed by a difficult labor, while at another time they will be quite\\n      free from the vomiting, and will pass through the succeeding labor with\\n      comparative ease.\" I must say my observations make me agree with Dr.\\n      Mettler entirely; when one thinks how rapidly the mildest of cases assume\\n      pernicious forms, indifference is certainly no longer to be excused. There\\n      is a voluminous literature upon this subject, and many and varied are the\\n      aetiological reasons given for this very variable affection, a large\\n      majority of writers coinciding in the opinion that \"many causes\\n      operate together,\" to produce what we are pleased to designate the\\n      \"vomiting of pregnancy.\" I believe myself that in a large\\n      percentage of cases, this pernicious vomiting is simply the result of a\\n      reflex neurosis. Undoubtedly uterine displacements frequently cause\\n      vomiting; but when this is so, and the displaced organ is raised by\\n      packing the vagina with aseptic wool, the vomiting ceases.\\n      \\n Lillie reports a number of cases, where\\n      obstinate vomiting was caused by a retroflexed uterus, and restoration of\\n      the organ caused a cessation of the disorder. Bezugloff having a\\n      persistent case of morning sickness, introduced a bougie it no the uterus,\\n      the intention being to produce abortion; the immediate result was a\\n      stoppage of the vomiting, and the pregnancy went on to full term.\\n      \\n In the case just cited, I must say that\\n      I believe it was the fright, caused by the thought of abortion being\\n      performed, more than the effects of introducing the bougie, which operated\\n      so successfully; I say now, as I said before, I believe that the\\n      pre-eminent cause of this kind of sickness must be looked for i the\\n      nervous system. Flint speaks of this form of sickness as being decidedly\\n      neurotic in its origin, and cites a number of cases of a chronic variety\\n      of dyspepsia frequently occurring in young girls. I had one such case come\\n      under my personal care. There was a persistent morning sickness, with this\\n      young lady, and a disagreeable nausea whenever food was taken; this\\n      patient was at some distance from her home, in a boarding school, and she\\n      will probably never know that the lady principal entertained very grave\\n      thoughts at one time in regard to her virtue. It certainly was very\\n      difficult to differentiate between this and the vomiting of pregnancy; it\\n      was, however, simply due to a vitiated nervous system. My theory is\\n      supported by Alt, who records a number of such cases; I cite one only, the\\n      case being that of a highly hysterical woman, six months pregnant,\\n      suffering from the gravest vomiting, and anxious that miscarriage be\\n      induced. She was making preparation for entering the hospital for this\\n      purpose, when one of her children was seized with pneumonia. The anxiety\\n      felt over the child, forced all thought of self from the mother\\'s mind;\\n      from that moment the vomiting ceased and she remained well until the\\n      termination of pregnancy.-Minchener Medicinische Wochenschrift.\\n      \\n Whilst saying that I believe this\\n      disease to be in the majority of cases of purely nervous origin, I would\\n      not imply thereby that it is not to be feared, far from it; if neglected,\\n      we know how likely it is to pass quickly beyond treatment and our patient\\n      succumb from sheer exhaustion.\\n      \\n In the treatment cited such as\\n      insertion of bougies, dilation of the os, pelvic massage, etc., I believe\\n      it is merely the \"doing something,\" no matter much what it is,\\n      so long as you have gained the confidence of your patient, that does good.\\n      We have seen how suddenly Hyperemesis will cease if the patient be\\n      alarmed; it may be, has often been, and will to again, cured by a process\\n      skin to suggestion. Kattenback had a case where the patient, a primipara,\\n      was seized with an incorrigible vomiting. It was suggested to her that her\\n      stomach contained some lumps of unwholesome material and their removal\\n      would cure her. Some milk was given her, and the stomach ceremoniously\\n      washed out. its contents bore no indications of either over-acidity or\\n      abnormal ferment She was informed that she was all right and the vomiting\\n      would not return; neither did if, and she was safely delivered at term.\\n      \\n There is a familiar and now well-know\\n      phenomena, by which these neurotics can be influenced; I speak of\\n      hypnotism; it is due to purely subjective conditions.\\n      \\n There is an identity of the hypnotic\\n      susceptibility with the condition of hysteria, and it is along these lines\\n      that we can work. Just as many times as I have tried this method of\\n      treatment, for these cases of excessive vomiting, just so many times has\\n      it given me gratifying results.\\n      \\n The patient can be to sleep by\\n      bi-ocular pressure, and the idea of cure suggested; the operation may have\\n      to be repeated several times, at intervals of a day or so, but you will be\\n      rewarded by the cessation of the vomiting, often with but one suggestion.\\n      Where the patient is not easily controlled by means of the bi-ocular\\n      pressure, Luy\\'s revolving mirror is a never failing resource.'\n",
      " 'Tresorie - PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS [Presidential Address]\\n\\n THE ROLE OF HOMOEOPATHY IN THE SECOND\\n      \\n By ALVA BENJAMIN, M.B.CH.B., F.F.HOM.\\n      \\n Such a system of medicine must\\n      recognize that it is as much an art as a science, and that healing is a\\n      relationship between two living personalities. It must recognize too, that\\n      the sick individual has to take an active part in his treatment and not be\\n      merely the passive recipient of this or that treatment. For just as it is\\n      rightly said that man does not live by alone, so should it be emphasized\\n      that man cannot be cured by medicine alone. He must see to it himself that\\n      he lives as far as possible a physically and psychically healthy life.\\n      Indeed, each individual has a power within himself to help in his own\\n      cure.\\n      \\n Do the official schools of medicine\\n      teach such an art today? I am afraid not: they are so intent on seeking\\n      the specific treatment for this or that named disease or the antibiotic\\n      that will most effectively put out of action the organism regarded as the\\n      cause of the disease, that they are losing sight of the individual\\n      himself.\\n      \\n But Homoeopathy in its persistent\\n      search for the reactions of the individual to his environment in the\\n      broadest sense, no matter of what the patient is complaining surely\\n      fulfills these requirements, especially when it is recognized that the\\n      homoeopathic potencies do not anything to the patient as do the drugs of\\n      the dominant school, but rather stimulate the patients own recuperative\\n      powers to overcome the infection or re - establish the normal metabolism\\n      which has become deranged by the illness.\\n      \\n When you consider how the homoeopathic\\n      physician diagnoses the individuality of his patient over and above the\\n      name of the disease from which he is suffering, and uses for the purpose\\n      of his prescription rather than the name of the disease this personal\\n      diagnosis of the patients mental and emotional reactions, his responses to\\n      changes in weather conditions, the alternations in his environment which\\n      influence his symptoms, etc., one realize how very individualistic is the\\n      Homoeopathic prescription fitted to that particular patient.\\n      \\n The homoeopathic physician does not\\n      seek for a remedy specific to any named disease and which he can thus\\n      apply almost automatically once he has made his organic diagnosis, which\\n      in quite an appreciable number of instances may ultimately be found to be\\n      wrong and so the treatment based upon it must therefore have been wrong.\\n      He does not, as is so often done, merely suppress the most outstanding\\n      symptom by an appropriate drug; for example giving an anodyne to mask the\\n      pain or removing the skin eruption by some strong local application, in\\n      other words putting the dust under the mat and pretending the room is\\n      clean.\\n      \\n Strangely enough the homoeopathic\\n      physician is often accused by his allopathic critic in his ignorance of\\n      Homoeopathy, of merely treating symptoms, whereas it is the critic himself\\n      who practices this superficial medicine. The homoeopathic physician, on\\n      the other hand, treats his patient as a whole through his symptoms and\\n      their modifications through changes in the environment, which is quite a\\n      different matter.\\n      \\n Homoeopathic therapy, unlike methods of\\n      treatment, is based on a natural law \"Similia Similibus\\n      Curentur\" \"Likes may be cured by likes\" which has been\\n      proved time and time again by experiment and which anyone with the will to\\n      do may prove for himself. It is not subject to constant change brought\\n      about by this or that latest discovery, and which itself will soon have to\\n      give way to the still later idea.\\n      \\n Having now introduced to you our actor,\\n      what of the scene in which he is to play his role?\\n      \\n This is the nineteen hundred and fifty\\n      - fourth year of the Christian era and the second year of the reign of our\\n      much loved and admired young Queen Elizabeth II, who will remember while\\n      in south Africa on her twenty - first birthday, before she had any idea\\n      that she would so soon be called to such an exalted position as she holds\\n      today, broadcast to the commonwealth and Empire her resolve to dedicate\\n      her life to the service of this grand community which dedication she\\n      recently repeated at her Coronation.\\n      \\n Here in Great Britain we have a more or\\n      less complete welfare state, with which idea some of us may very strongly\\n      disagree, whilst others believe such a development is the result of a\\n      natural very desirable social evolution.\\n      \\n As one necessary ingredient of this\\n      welfare state came, in 1948, the initiation of the National Health\\n      Service, through which the great majority of the population receives its\\n      medical attention, although it is rightly available to all.\\n      \\n When we come to consider the role that\\n      homoeo - therapeutics should play in this scheme, I would suggest that we\\n      should regard the problem from the purely medical aspect, forgetting any\\n      political party allegiances or sympathies we may have; or if we cannot\\n      forget them we should remember that the organization of the National\\n      Insurance Scheme of which the National Health Service is but a part, was\\n      first blue printed by the well - known Liberal supporter, Lord Beveridge,\\n      and the Health Service plans developed by the Coalition Government of all\\n      three major political parties.\\n      \\n We are living at present in an age\\n      which may very justifiably be regarded as a violent age in which have been\\n      developed so many appalling instruments of destruction, the use of some of\\n      which we are quite complacently accepting and from the use of others we\\n      are refraining, not because we consider them immoral, but simply through\\n      the fear of the wholesale destruction which would be caused by their use.\\n      We are seeing X-rays used in very high voltages in the treatment of\\n      cancer, we are being constantly remained of the use of dangerous drugs in\\n      medicine, without justification, in my opinion, bearing in mind the\\n      doubtful and evanescent ameliorations they produce and the violent\\n      surgical treatment of mental patients.\\n      \\n One further violence we should not\\n      forget is the way some of our foods are devitalized by the extraction of\\n      this or that portion of the natural product for purposes quite foreign to\\n      the well - being of the people who are to feed on them; or they are\\n      contaminated by the addition of this or that dangerous chemical, either\\n      during the growing of the plant, in the form of sprays, or as so called\\n      improvers in, for instance, the manufacture of white bread. It is very\\n      significant in this regard that quite a lot of attention is paid to the\\n      protection of the man who sprays the crops, but the right of the consumer\\n      to have uncontaminated food is slurred over by the unjustifiable statement\\n      that the amount of these chemicals so consumed is so small that it cannot\\n      have any bad effect on the consumer. We who practice Homoeopathy know how\\n      unwarranted is such a statement.\\n      \\n Can we homoeopathic physicians and\\n      patient hope to be able to do anything to make the still small voice of\\n      Homoeopathy heard in all this tumult, so that we may return to a saner and\\n      more healthful way of life and help our young Queen in her lifes work for\\n      the communitys sake?\\n      \\n Can we expect any help from the leaders\\n      of the medical profession? I am afraid not, because although I believe it\\n      accurate to state that there is a very slowly growing interest in, and\\n      tolerance of our work by individual doctors, the medical authorities are\\n      still, in their prejudice, strongly opposed to us. The London University\\n      still refuses to recognize our Hospital as a post - graduate teaching\\n      Hospital: the British Medical Association prohibits the formation of a\\n      homoeopathic section of its organization, and the Royal College of\\n      Physicians still refuses its membership to any one known as a homoeopathic\\n      physician. Yet in spite of this unfavourable environment, I firmly believe\\n      that there is a future for our method of therapeutics: but it will have to\\n      be pursued with courage, determination, foresight and energy. Surely if we\\n      believe as I do, that we are the guardians of a system of treatment\\n      destined to make our people healthier and therefore more efficient and\\n      happier, we would be failing in our duty to our country if we did not take\\n      every means in our power to acquaint the community at large with the\\n      advantages of this system and the dangers of ignoring it. This is a duty,\\n      not only of the profession, but also of the laity interested in\\n      Homoeopathy and who have experienced its benefits.\\n      \\n Every physician has two professional\\n      obligation to the community, that of preserving its health and that of\\n      endeavouring to restore it to being when it has fallen by the way.\\n      \\n The homoeopathic physician, thorough\\n      his knowledge acquired through the provings of drugs, even in\\n      infinitesimal doses, has, I believe, a very special responsibility as\\n      regards the prophylaxis of disease. It seems to me that a great deal of\\n      chronic ill health may quite conceivably be due to the manipulations of\\n      our foods and to the artificial manuring of the ground in which many of\\n      them are grown. Experiments have been carried our proving that plants\\n      grown in soil enriched by natural manuring, are much less prone to\\n      diseases than those grown with the help of artificial chemical manures. It\\n      seems a fairly justified conclusion that vegetables grown under these\\n      artificial conditions may quite well be deficient in something necessary\\n      for our perfect health. It is therefore incumbent upon the physician to\\n      advocate whenever possible the ingestion of healthily grown foods in the\\n      widest sense of that term.\\n      \\n The same duty applies when we consider\\n      the great amount of drugging in which the community at large indulges by\\n      its excessive smoking, particularly when aggravated by the practice of\\n      inhaling, and by the continued and prolonged use of drugs for this or that\\n      symptom, too often, unfortunately, though not always, on the prescription\\n      of their medical advisors.\\n      \\n There is a great lack throughout the\\n      community of any real enthusiasm for perfect health: we are only too prone\\n      to be content to follow like sheep, the unintelligent and harmful\\n      practices of the majority of our fellows.\\n      \\n Similarly in the curative realm, we\\n      homoeopathic physicians have special obligations.\\n      \\n When considering our position vis-a-vis\\n      the rest of the profession, we must never lose sight of the fact that our\\n      approach to the sick individual is a much broader and more comprehensive\\n      one than that of the dominant school. This latter prides itself on its\\n      scientific approach to its problems. One must, however, always be on ones\\n      guard against being hypnotized by that word scientific. The scientific\\n      aspect of any phenomenon or problem dealing with humanity is only one\\n      limited aspect of that problem. To get a complete picture one must\\n      consider other aspect, such as the aesthetic, emotional, maybe religious,\\n      and above all, perhaps one might say embracing all, the philosophical\\n      approach. This complex approach to his patients problem is the one that\\n      the homoeopathic physician always strives to adopt, and so never loses\\n      sight of the ego of the patient, while at the same time not forgetting his\\n      physical make - up.\\n      \\n Because this approach of ours to our\\n      patients is a much broader and more comprehensive one than the much\\n      vaunted scientific aspect, which the dominant school has come to regard as\\n      the Ultima Thule of medicine, I deplore the oft - repeated request of some\\n      of my colleagues that we should forsake our philosophy and make our work\\n      as scientific as theirs. I do not mean to imply by this that we should\\n      neglect the scientific angle of our patients illness but we should always\\n      remember that is only one facet of our problem. That is why we take such\\n      pains to diagnose our patients personality with his reaction to his\\n      environment in addition to the physical diagnosis of the case in order to\\n      arrive at our prescription for his malady. In other words, we should\\n      endeavour to lead our dominant school colleagues to our way of thinking,\\n      rather than that we should adopt theirs.\\n      \\n At the same time must always remember\\n      that if our philosophy should seem at any time to contradict so - called\\n      scientific laws, we must re - examine our philosophy, and if necessary\\n      modify it, while at the same time remembering that many times in the past\\n      what have been regarded as laws have ultimately been proved not to be so.\\n      Thus it is evident that we must never relax our self - examination.\\n      \\n What shall be the role of the\\n      homoeopathic laity?\\n      \\n The first thing for them to remember is\\n      that we are living in a democratic country whose government is dependent\\n      on the goodwill of the governed, and that, if a sufficient number of\\n      voters desire a certain line of action, that line will be adopted by the\\n      government.\\n      \\n The second thought is that there are\\n      not nearly sufficient doctors practising Homoeopathy in Great Britain to\\n      satisfy the present demand, let alone any further increased demand in the\\n      future, for this line of treatment.\\n      \\n Does not this seem strange, having\\n      regard to the great advantage to humanity that Homoeopathy provides? Not\\n      if one looks below the surface and so finds the reason for this shortage.\\n      \\n Surely the most potent reason is that\\n      Homoeopathy is not taught in the official Medical Schools, either as a pre\\n      - or post - graduate study. The London University when asked to recognize\\n      the Royal London Homoeopathic Hospital as a post - graduate Medical\\n      School, refused on the plea that as Homoeopathy was not taught in the\\n      undergraduate Medical Schools, it could not find a place for it in its\\n      post - graduate curriculum.\\n      \\n It is, of course, nonsense to suggest\\n      that a graduate should pursue his studies only in those subject of which\\n      he had already obtained some knowledge in his undergraduate days and\\n      should not wish to obtain information on any new or extra subject.\\n      \\n The University Medical Shools are\\n      enabled to a great extent through Government grants. We must therefore\\n      find some way of influencing whatever Government be in power to bring\\n      pressure to bear upon the London University to remove this obstacle to the\\n      better health of the community at large. I am quite satisfied that once\\n      this academic recognition is obtained we shave many more post - graduate\\n      students of Homoeopathy.\\n      \\n I believe than in a democratic\\n      community, having a universal State Medical Service, it is the bounden\\n      duty of the Government to remove all obstacles to the peoples obtaining\\n      that form of medical treatment in which they have confidence. So long as\\n      Homoeopathy is denied its legitimate status, so long must be Government be\\n      deemed to b failing in its duty to the country.\\n      \\n If, however, we are to achieve this\\n      desirable object of full recognition, we must all, professional and laity,\\n      be fired with enthusiasm, not only for the abstract cause of Homoeopathy,\\n      but for being partners with our young Queen in delicating our lives to the\\n      community.\\n      \\n When we do this we shall help to make\\n      this second Elizabethan era one to be remembered throughout the ages to\\n      come as surpassing the first Elizabethan era in that it gained not so much\\n      the economic and political leadership of the world - though that is not to\\n      be despised - but showed the way to the most healthful and spiritual way\\n      of life that all the world look notice and followed suit.\\n      \\n To sum up, the Role of Homoeopathy, as\\n      I see it, is to humanize the practice of medicine. By that I mean it must\\n      bring the practice of medicine into line with a reasoned philosophy of\\n      life, restore to it its artistry and rid it of all unnecessary hazards. It\\n      is to do this, not from any abstract academic sense of superiority, but in\\n      order the years to come are not those of merely another reign, but to\\n      ensure a veritable Renaissance, starting with the second Elizabethan era\\n      in which Great Britain will take its rightful place in the comity of\\n      nations as the pathfinder to a way of life for which posterity will be\\n      able to say \"Thank God for Queen Elizabeth the Second and her\\n      peoples.'\n",
      " 'Tresorie - Roentgenometric Pelvimetry [Roentgenometric Pelvimetry]\\n CHARLES W.PERKINS, M.D.\\n      \\n Norwalk, Conn\\n      \\n FOR some time the x-ray has been used\\n      to advantage in diagnosis of multiple pregnancy, position of fetus and\\n      fetal abnormalities. However, it has been only the past four or five years\\n      that any definite information has been obtained by roentgenographic\\n      methods of diagnoses in pelvimetry.\\n      \\n At the present time we are convinced\\n      that only by means of roentgenographs can be true proportions of the\\n      superior strait be determined, and that the ordinary external methods of\\n      Pelvimetry are not only occasionally misleading but proportionately\\n      inaccurate.\\n      \\n The present communication deals with\\n      the method of Herbert Thomas of Yale University. This method was developed\\n      in cooperation with the late Dr. W.A. Lafield, who was Professor of\\n      Roentgenology at the Yale Medical School.\\n      \\n Some of the reasons why roentgen\\n      pelvimetry has not been more universally adopted are probably due to the\\n      following factors.\\n      \\n (1) The majority of women will be\\n      delivered normally, whether or not pelvic measurements are made.\\n      \\n (2) The medical profession does not\\n      readily accept a new method after an established satisfactory routine has\\n      been in use.\\n      \\n (3) A new method of diagnosis incurs\\n      added expense.\\n      \\n (4) The present methods, although\\n      entirely speculative, are satisfactory in most cases.\\n      \\n (5) Roentgen pelvimetry cannot be\\n      performed by the obstetrician himself but requires the aid of a\\n      roentgenologist.\\n      \\n (6) The value of roentgenometric\\n      diagnosis is recent in origin and as yet not universally accepted.\\n      \\n If the knowledge of the size and shape\\n      of the pelvis is necessary to the practice of obstetrics, roentgen\\n      pelvimetry is a sound procedure, particularly in pre-emptors patients, and\\n      should and should be considered as an indispensable aid in these cases.\\n      \\n The method of Herbert Thoms as\\n      developed at Yale Medical School is not the only method. However, it can\\n      be classified as simple, accurate and rapid; being adaptable for use by\\n      other than experts in x-ray and obstetric diagnosis. As a technical\\n      procedure a well trained hospital technician can master its technic alter\\n      sufficient instruction.\\n      \\n Studies of recent years reveal the fact\\n      that external Pelvimetry fails to give uniform and accurate information in\\n      regard to the shape and size of the superior strait. This is often true of\\n      thin undersized individuals. In many patients of this type external\\n      measurements may suggest a contracted pelvis while the x-ray will show a\\n      relatively large pelvis with a subsequent natural labor and normal-sized\\n      child. On the other hand a stocky short person with similar external\\n      measurements will disclose a contracted pelvis which is an obstetric\\n      problem. Because of the apparent relationship between shortening of the\\n      transverse diameter and a secondary persistent occipito-posterior\\n      presentation, accurate information regarding this diameter is of clinical\\n      significance.\\n      \\n The observations of Thomas were made on\\n      twenty consecutive patients whose pelvis showed a relative or real\\n      shortening of the transverse diameter of the superior strait. In every\\n      instance a primary or secondary occipito posterior position was found\\n      after the patient was in labor. (Herbert Thoms, Surgery, Gynecology and\\n      Obstetrics, January, 1933). It therefore has been proved that an actual or\\n      relative shortening of a transverse diameter of the superior strait\\n      results in a limitation of space that is greater in the anterior than in\\n      the posterior half of the superior strait. Under these circumstances, when\\n      the head descends early in labor, the occiput is forced to rotate\\n      posteriorly.\\n      \\n The x-ray offers additional information\\n      in determining the size of the fetal head. It has been noted in x-ray\\n      examination of the unengaged fetal head that it lay with the transverse\\n      diameter of the superior strait, the occiput being either to the right or\\n      left; therefore, if roentgenogram of the patient is taken in the supine\\n      position with the fetus in the uterus, it will cast a shadow which is an\\n      enlarged profile of the head. The measurements of the occipital frontal\\n      diameter of the head can then be made. On numerous occasions this method\\n      of cephalometry, determining the diameter of the unmoulded head before and\\n      after cesarean section, has yielded accurate results. (Thomas, A.M.A.,\\n      February 24, 1934).\\n      \\n As experience increases in roentgen\\n      pelvimetry, the so-called labor test will be employed less. This, however,\\n      does not mean that the physician should not under estimate the importance\\n      of uterine contraction and the ability of the fetal head to mold. It has\\n      always followed that when something could be proved desirable in medicine\\n      for the better protection of the patient, such an advance would be\\n      demanded and eventually become routine. We may concede, therefore, that\\n      roentgen pelvimetry has a distinct place in the examination of every\\n      primiparous woman. In many instances, according to Thomas and others,\\n      external; measurements were normal but the x-ray examination revealed a\\n      contracted pelvis. On the other had, in certain patients whose external\\n      measurements suggested a cesarean section roentgen pelvimetry proved\\n      otherwise and they were subsequently delivered in a normal manner.\\n      \\n CENTIMETER GRID METHOD.\\n      \\n The procedure in this method may be\\n      summarized by stating the following:.\\n      \\n (1) The patient is placed on the\\n      roentgenographic table in the semi- recumbent position.\\n      \\n (2) The level of the superior strait\\n      above the sensitized film is established.\\n      \\n (3) The tube target is centered about\\n      five centimeters posterior to the symphysis, at thirty-two inches from the\\n      sensitized film, The exposure is made.\\n      \\n (4) The patient is removed from the\\n      table, the tube target and sensitized film remaining in situ.\\n      \\n (5) A lead plate, or centimeter grid,\\n      with perforations exactly one centimeter apart, is introduced into the\\n      same plane as that previously occupied by the superior strait and a second\\n      (flash) exposure is made on the same sensitized film as was used used in\\n      the previous exposure.\\n      \\n (6) Development of the film shows the\\n      outline of the superior strait and the shadows of the perforations, the\\n      assistance between which represents centimeters in the plane of the\\n      superior strait. The anteroposterior and transverse diameters of the\\n      superior strait in its use proportions may be drawn on centimeter-square\\n      paper by following the course of the shadow of the superior strait and\\n      transcribing it.\\n      \\n As this time I wish to express my\\n      thanks to Dr. Thoms for his personal advice and instruction which helped\\n      me to master the technic of his method.'\n",
      " 'Tresorie - NOTATU DIGNUM [Test Of A Homoeopath]\\n\\n Complaints are not unfrequently made\\n      that the homoeopathic materia medica is too vast for practical utility;\\n      that the schematised list of symptoms are unprofitable, if not impossible\\n      reading. I do not think so. Indeed, I think that the test of a genuine\\n      homoeopath might not unfairly be said to life in his capacity to read\\n      through a Schema with both profit and enjoyment because of the\\n      possibilities it reveals of dealing with cases occurring every day in\\n      practice.

      " 'Tresorie - THE EFFICACY OF THE VIBROMETER IN APPLYING VIBRATORY MASSAGE\\nIN AURAL DISEASES [Efficacy Of Vibrometer In Applying Vibratory Message In Aural\\nDisease]\\n\\n SINCE presenting my paper before the\\n      American Institute, in June of last year on \"Vibratory Motion as a\\n      Method of Massage in Aural Diseases,\" I have been using an instrument\\n      specially devised for that purpose called the \"vibrometer.\" This\\n      instrument is in shape like a banjo, and has four strings stretched across\\n      its length resting on a bridge, which sets upon a diaphragm. On each side,\\n      elevated above the diaphragm and supported by posts, are two horizontal\\n      bars, which support the mechanical appliances used for producing the\\n      various vibratory motions. This consists in what is called a yoke, in\\n      which revolves a shaft connected with the electro-motor by pulley-wheels\\n      and a belt. Behind the diaphragm is a shallow air-tight compartment,\\n      leading from which are rubber tubes that are inserted in the external\\n      auditory canal during treatment, consequently any vibratory motion of the\\n      diaphragm, which must necessarily be an inward and a corresponding outward\\n      movement, would be exactly reproduced upon the membrana tympani, as the\\n      confined air, not being able to escape, will undergo an alternate\\n      condensation and rarefication in the external auditory canal.\\n      \\n Every vibratory movement of the strings\\n      of the instrument is communicated to the diaphragm by means of the bridge\\n      upon which it rests. These strings by varying their tension and length can\\n      be regulated to give a high or low rate of vibration as desired, for\\n      instance, the heaviest string left at its original length adjusted to a\\n      slight tension may make about fifty vibratory motions to the second, while\\n      the highest string on the instrument adjusted to a high tension and\\n      clamped down to one-fourth its original length would probably make three\\n      thousand vibratory motions to the second.\\n      \\n In the centre of the diaphragm is an\\n      attachment which works on a lever, and when hit by the cam on the\\n      revolving shaft lifts the diaphragm to a considerable extent, causing a\\n      powerful effect on the membrana tympani. This attachment can be adjusted\\n      at four different leverages, which causes a modification or increase of\\n      its intensity and can be regulated at from one to twenty-five vibratory\\n      movements to the second. This is only used in very bad cases and for not\\n      more than five minutes continuously.\\n      \\n The instrument which I have been\\n      describing in an improvement on the first manufactured, and as far as I\\n      know, is the only one which offers the same facilities for applying this\\n      method of massage. The class of patients in my experience who are\\n      generally benefited from the first, are those in which the mucous membrane\\n      lining the tympanic cavity and Eustachian tubes is in a hypertrophic\\n      condition. The membrana tympani are depressed, opaque, and thickened. They\\n      usually complain of a stiffed sensation in the ears, with a great deal of\\n      tinnitus aurium, and that their hearing is worse during a cold. In cases\\n      where the mucous membranes are atrophied with a large external auditory\\n      canal perfectly dry and Eustachian tubes patulous, and generally very\\n      little tinnitus, this or no other treatment has done very much good in the\\n      majority of cases, and in looking ever my records I find that only about\\n      five per cent. have been relieved, while in the before-mentioned cases the\\n      good results reach at least seventy-five per cent. In treating persons, I\\n      always select the rate of vibration which corresponds in pitch, if\\n      possible, to that caused by the diseased condition of the ears. If there\\n      is no tinnitus to guide me, I find whether the patient can hear a high or\\n      low sound better; if it is a low sound, a high rate of vibration is used\\n      in treatment, and vice versa, A point which I would like to explain here\\n      is this: It is not necessary that the sound from the instrument should be\\n      of the same quality of the tinnitus experienced by the patient, but merely\\n      the same pitch. for instance, if a banjo, where one of the strings was\\n      adjusted when sounded to produce a certain note, and a musical instrument\\n      of any other kind, whose quality of tone was entirely different, was made\\n      to sound the same note in a room, the string on the banjo would vibrate in\\n      sympathy, which has been proven by experiment, any other note, no matter\\n      how loud, would have no effect. Another point is in the way the strings of\\n      the vibrometer are set in motion. On the revolving shaft is a wheel\\n      projecting from which are metallic picks which hit the string it is\\n      adjusted over. It does not make any difference in the number of vibratory\\n      motions per second, whether the string is hit fast or slow, but at the\\n      time the string is first hit the intensity is greater than it is just\\n      before being hit again, and as the motion of the wheel is perfectly\\n      rhythmic, revolving so many times to the second, it has just as good an\\n      effect as if the intensity during the fraction of a second did not vary at\\n      all. The idea of using vibratory motion, as I have said before, originated\\n      within my mind some years ago, and later put into practical operation, and\\n      as far as I know, was the first to lay before the profession in a\\n      scientific manner, this method of massage.\\n      \\n I have found that when two of the\\n      strings upon the vibrometer were regulated in such a way that when both\\n      were set in vibration at the same time, producing the sensation of a\\n      harmonious sound, the effect in some cases on the tinnitus was especially\\n      beneficial, relieving, where the various kinds of vibrations produced by a\\n      single string failed. Sub-acute cases of deafness, accompanied by tinnitus\\n      aurium, are quickly relieved, as the following case will illustrate:.\\n      \\n Mrs. M. Young, married lady, aet. 26,\\n      called at my office, April 1, 1893, complaining of partial deafness and\\n      tinnitus aurium. She had a stuffed sensation, or as if cotton had been\\n      packed in the external auditory canal. She says the tinnitus was so\\n      annoying as to prevent sleep. On examination, found considerable\\n      retraction of the membrana tympani, and hearing for the watch, on the\\n      right side five inches, on the left, seven inches. The Eustachian tube\\n      were partially closed, which made inflation somewhat difficult, giving\\n      slight relief. I used several of the vibrations on the different strings\\n      without immediate benefit.\\n      \\n April 4th.-She came again, and reported\\n      that no improvement had taken place. I again inflated her ears, after\\n      which she sat down to the vibrometer. The central attachment was used with\\n      considerable force continuously for four minutes, after which she declared\\n      that the tinnitus had entirely ceased in the right ear, and greatly\\n      modified in the left; the hearing for the watch had increased for both\\n      ears to fourteen inches, and the stuffed sensation had almost entirely\\n      disappeared. On inspection of the membrana tympani, found them\\n      comparatively very slightly retracted. On April 8th, found improvement had\\n      continued, when the same treatment was used for three minutes; after which\\n      she declared herself completely relieved of the tinnitus and stuffed\\n      sensation, with hearing powerfully restored. Saw her again on April 13th,\\n      when she declared the good results from last treatment to have still\\n      continued.\\n      \\n I find that in the majority of cases,\\n      when the strings of the instrument are used it is only necessary to strike\\n      them lightly with the friction wheel. In vibrating the heavy string, I\\n      generally set the bridge back behind the central attachment, and adjusting\\n      the motor in such way that the belt is at a considerable tension, so that\\n      the pulley-wheel revolves slowly. I also generally use this adjustment\\n      when setting in motion two strings at one time. The principle of this\\n      method of treatment embraces two essential features which to my mind makes\\n      this system of massage the only scientific one applicable to the membrana\\n      tympani and its associate sound-conducting parts. Message is the\\n      application of motion to disease, and its scientific administration\\n      consists of its application in a systematic manner. In applying massage in\\n      aural diseases, it is necessary to produce a to-and-fro movement of the\\n      membrana tympani, and, if possible, by a force which is harmless and at\\n      the same time effective. The vibrometer fulfils these conditions. Any of\\n      the strings on the instrument that may be set in motion by the\\n      friction-wheel, will produce a certain number of vibratory movements to\\n      the second of time, and the movements of the central attachment are also\\n      measured. What could be more systematic than this? The motions of the\\n      membrana tympani were intended by nature to its vibratory, and as the\\n      vibrometer generates measured motion, and these motions are vibratory,\\n      theoretically we have a scientific and effective method of massage in\\n      aural diseases; and, as demonstrated practically by the use of the\\n      vibrometer, we have in fact a great scientific advance over all previous\\n      methods. Since the introduction of this treatment in aural diseases, it\\n      makes possible a more or less benefit in cases of deafness heretofore\\n      considered hopeless, and has opened up the field for the treatment of\\n      aural diseases to such an extent that the number of deaf patients seeking\\n      relief at the aurist\\'s hands will at least double itself.\\n      \\n DISCUSSION.\\n      \\n H.C. HOUGHTON, M.D.: Dr. Garey\\'s\\n      admirable paper gives us the description of the vibrometer, an instrument\\n      devised under his personal direction and inspection, for the purpose of\\n      applying massage to the ear. It is the only instrument of the kind on the\\n      market, so far as I am aware, and after a somewhat prolonged use of it, I\\n      am prepared to recommend the latest production of the vibrometer company.\\n      \\n This instrument is a decided\\n      improvement over the instrument first sent out, and is capable of\\n      producing a most profound effect upon the drum-head and ossicula; indeed,\\n      upon the entire auditory apparatus. I am able to confirm Dr. Garey\\'s\\n      statement of the effect of high and low vibrations us regards treatment.\\n      \\n I have also been very much interested\\n      in the use of stringed or reed instruments for diagnosis, and find that we\\n      can detect any abnormal sensitiveness of the auditory nerve to high or low\\n      tones. Some patients are extremely sensitive to all tones, high or low;\\n      others to high tones and not to low tones; others, conversely. Again, in\\n      some instances, there is a peculiar sensitiveness to single tones or to\\n      discords produced by sounding the note and half-note at the same time.\\n      Under the action of the central attachment of the vibrometer this\\n      sensitiveness is modified, the sensitiveness to high tones disappearing\\n      and being replaced by a low tone or, conversely, under treatment, a low\\n      tone disappears and a high tone is established, temporarily, at least.\\n      Again, in cases of recent origin, treatment will substitute an undefined\\n      rushing sound for a definite musical tone, either high or low, and later,\\n      the treatment will abolish this, the patient being relieved of this\\n      intensely annoying symptom. In some cases, with this relief, there is an\\n      improvement in the audition; in other cases, no improvement follows.\\n      \\n I confess to the domination of the\\n      material over my mind in my earlier experience with massage, and I think\\n      the inclination of operators will be to use a far greater degree of power\\n      than is necessary. I therefore notice with great satisfaction Professor\\n      Garey\\'s remark that \"the object should be to produce a to-and-fro\\n      motion to the membrana tympani, and, if possible, by a force which is\\n      harmless and at the same time effective.\" I would hardly say\\n      \"to-and-fro motion of the drum-head,\" because I think that the\\n      expression is liable to perpetuate the motion which is fixed in the minds\\n      of most physiologists, that the drum-head moves as a whole, with a\\n      to-and-fro motion.\" That is true under the influence of the Politzer,\\n      Siegle\\'s otoscope and similar instruments; but it certainly does not so\\n      move in the ordinary function of audition, but stands as the iris does in\\n      the eye, as an adjustor, a regulator of sound-force; in some sense as the\\n      iris does in its relation with the lens, to adjust, regulate and direct\\n      the essential force, and the vibration of the drum-head is at every node;\\n      every portion receives impressions that are converted into molecular\\n      disturbances of varying lengths, according as they are produced upon the\\n      stiff and unyielding portions of the drum-head at the periphery, along the\\n      manubrium, or in the more attenuated and easily-yielding portions which\\n      the between these two areas. Not only so, but these impulses are\\n      communicated to the contained air of the tympanum, and make their\\n      impression upon the acoustic nerve through the round window synchronously\\n      with the impression made through the ossicula.\\n      \\n This whole subject widens before my\\n      mind in such a way that one might wish himself twenty years and at liberty\\n      to devote himself to a term of research in acoustics, such as is offered\\n      only in the technical schools of the continent of Europe.\\n      \\n WM. R. KING, M.D.: In discussing Dr.\\n      Garey\\'s paper I shall begin by saying that his methods have been closely\\n      followed by me since the beginning of his experiments, owing to the fact\\n      that I have been greatly interested in the treatment of deafness and\\n      tinnitus by means of sound waves or by aural massage since 1887, and have\\n      experimented and treated many cases by this method since then, though with\\n      crude and unsatisfactory instruments. Since using the vibrometer-which,\\n      after much study and experimentation, is now presented to the profession\\n      in practical shape-I have undoubtedly increased my percentage of good\\n      results.\\n      \\n I don\\'t believe I am over-sanguine or\\n      carried away by interest in this method, and believe I can rightly\\n      appreciate that this does not offer us a panacea or cure-all for auditory\\n      ailments, and hope I may always be ready to see the failures and to strive\\n      to find methods or remedies to reach some of them.\\n      \\n In speaking of the application of the\\n      instrument, I wish to call attention to the central attachment or post foe\\n      vibrations. Dr. Garey has not given it as much attention in the paper as\\n      it deserves. It is very useful as a general means of aural massage,\\n      rougher in nature and more general in application than the strings which\\n      help to make up the instrument. I often use it before applying the\\n      \"similar found\" to a given case, as a species of gymnastics, to\\n      stimulate secretion and motion in the conducting apparatus of the ear,\\n      viz., membrana tympani and ossicles. In most cases-in fact, in all-where\\n      tinnitus is present, I follow this up immediately by the nearest approach\\n      to the similar pitch obtainable.\\n      \\n I agree thoroughly with Dr. Garey, that\\n      the best results are achieved in cases accompanying hypertrophic catarrh,\\n      and that the least benefit is apparent in cases of atrophic nature.\\n      \\n Regarding the method of treatment in\\n      the absence of tinnitus, my experience the does not coincide with that of\\n      the author of the paper entirely; I do not feel that as yet we have any\\n      safe rule to guide us. My method has been to try the numerous sounds and\\n      variations the of until I find the one that seems to give the best\\n      immediate results, or that the patient himself will speak of as very\\n      penetrating and powerful )though not necessarily loud and heavy).\\n      \\n It seems almost impossible at present\\n      to simulate all the qualities of tone as they occur in the ears of those\\n      suffering with tinnitus; in fact, it would appear to be unnecessary.\\n      However, it seems advantageous and quite necessary to secure the closest\\n      simulation of pitch, thus in many cases soon obliterating annoying\\n      tinnitus and improving hearing powers.\\n      \\n The arrangement permitting of the\\n      picking of two strings simultaneously adds decidedly the usefulness of the\\n      instrument, as it increases the range of pitch as well as varying the\\n      quality of tones procurable, thereby decidedly enlarging our field of\\n      application.\\n      \\n The force used for creating the message\\n      or gymnastics of the membrana tympani and the ossicles-viz, vibratory\\n      force or sound- carefully and scientifically applied, is nature\\'s remedy,\\n      because it is adapted by nature, and is the only force which can rightly\\n      or safely be applied to these delicate portions of this complex organ of\\n      hearing.\\n      \\n A startling commentary on this subject\\n      is the array of cases benefited who have been relegated to the shelf by\\n      ancient and modern otology; cases declared unhelpable have been vastly\\n      improved. Pray, make no mistake; I did not say all cases.\\n      \\n It may be interesting to hear the\\n      latest regarding the instrument which was first invented for the\\n      application of this method of aural massage Mr. E.J. Godman, the inventor\\n      and patentee, is constantly on the lookout, and always striving for\\n      improvements to his machine. He has made many that you all know of. Permit\\n      me to report a few so recent they have not yet left the factory.\\n      \\n First.-The machine has been taken from\\n      its case, and is now mounted on a solid stand or table of oak, being set\\n      below the level, or so that the face of the instrument is just level with\\n      the face of the table. This is all supported by rigid, solid metal legs,\\n      which absolutely prevent foreign vibrations.\\n      \\n Second.-The motor has been removed from\\n      its little shelf and relegated below the table. I t can be placed upon a\\n      box on the floor, a shelf against the wall, or, better yet, a shelf\\n      solidly attached to the metal supports of the table. A belt goes up\\n      through an aperture to a wheel on a shaft, the other extremity of which\\n      carries a wheel with a rubber tire (a friction wheel), which in its\\n      revolution, being in contact with a larger flat- surfaced wheel on the\\n      main shaft of the instrument, turns this in harmony with itself. This\\n      arrangement does away with the necessity of shifting the motor each time\\n      you wish to shift the carriage from one string to another- a consummation\\n      to be devoutly thankful for. The removal of the motor from the instrument\\n      as at present attached will recommend itself to all who have used the\\n      vibrometer, a great amount of undesirable jar being thus avoided.\\n      \\n Third.-Ratchet keys capable of very\\n      fine adjustment of tension of strings are now provided for the instrument.\\n      \\n Fourth.-A rheostadt or resistance-coil\\n      is now to be placed beneath the table between the storage battery and the\\n      switch, by this means enabling us to control the speed and number of\\n      revolutions to a nicety.\\n      \\n Other, though comparatively minor,\\n      improvements are being made, and others are contemplated, as, for\\n      instance, the substitution of a roughly corrugated rubber band for the\\n      picker on the wheel, thereby getting rid of the metallic sound of the\\n      picker on the wire strings.\\n      \\n I have experimented with a number of\\n      appliance for the production of the sounds and pitches that I have\\n      required, but I always fall back on the vibrometer, especially as at\\n      present constructed, for satisfactory work and results.\\n      \\n This instrument may be, and probably\\n      is, as yet, in its infancy. It, and the method it applies, can only be\\n      perfected by constant work and experimentation both on the part of the\\n      profession and of the manufacturers. Each improvement we can suggest, if\\n      it only should serve as a means of helping one solitary case, would be\\n      well worth our while.\\n      \\n The experiments being made by different\\n      methods for treating deafness by sound waves is indicative of the interest\\n      the profession has taken in the matter. It is indicative of a lack of\\n      something in our usual armamentarium which is greatly longed for by\\n      patient and doctor; that is, the means for making the deaf hear and for\\n      relieving distressing tinnitus. There has been a dearth in this direction,\\n      and perhaps there still is, but I believe fully that we have in aural\\n      massage by vibratory force a decided acquisition at our hands.\\n      \\n E. H. LINNELL., M.D.: I would simply\\n      like to ask Dr. King how long he uses the instrument, and whether he uses\\n      it according to the deafness.\\n      \\n DR. KING: Yes, decidedly. In an intense\\n      case of deafness I would have to use it a great deal longer. The central\\n      attachment I never carry over three or five minutes, and the whole\\n      treatment I don\\'t think is over carried over twenty or twenty-five minutes\\n      in one case, and usually averages from ten to fifteen.\\n      \\n HAROLD WILSON, M.D.: I have only to\\n      suggest, what I have elsewhere called attention to, the possibility of\\n      another mechanical device for securing vibratory motion. It is well known\\n      that in the make and break of a current of electricity, in the circuit of\\n      which there is a telephone, we get an influence upon the make and break of\\n      the current in the telephone. Now, it is a simple matter with which these\\n      makes and breaks are made as to obtaining any number of vibration that you\\n      wish. You may, by a mechanical device of some rotary motion, if you\\n      choose, make and break the current as rapidly as you please until you have\\n      reached several thousand vibrations a second, or you may even make the\\n      vibrations so slow us to be easily counted. The application of this\\n      suggestion has been put in force in my own practice, more or less, in the\\n      use of the telephone as connected with the induction-coil ordinary\\n      battery. The more intense the current, the more intense the sound. You can\\n      easily see that it is mere question of mechanics to secure these two\\n      sounds-intensity of vibration and rapidity of vibration. I will say,\\n      furthermore, that it has this advantage. There is no noise in the office,\\n      which I think is not altogether true of the vibrometer. I would suggest\\n      that so far as the vibrometer is concerned, if it could be made to be\\n      noiseless to anybody but the patient, it would be a decided improvement.\\n      In that respect the telephone is a decided improvement, because there is\\n      no noise except to the patient, because the noise is right at the ear of\\n      the patient. If I were seeking for a perfected instrument in this line, I\\n      would go outside of the banjo idea. As we have the most perfect writing\\n      machines, which have no connection with the ordinary method of writing,\\n      and sewing machines, which have no connection with sewing by hand, so it\\n      occurs to me that possibly the securing of he vibratory motion upon the\\n      ears might be obtained in a totally different way from that which you get\\n      when you listen to the drum of the guitar or an ordinary musical\\n      instrument, and I would suggest that the make and break of a telephone\\n      open a very fruitful field for mechanical experimentation.\\n      \\n H.C. HOUGHTON, M.D.: In my study of\\n      this subject I made the acquaintance of Mr. Bernhardt, of New York City,\\n      who is a personal friend of Mr. Emil Berliner, the inventor of the Emil\\n      Berliner Telephone, which is the instrument by which the Bell Telephone\\n      Company maintain their monopoly at present. Mr. Berliner is the inventor\\n      of the graphophone, and has, I think, covered this whole matter which Dr.\\n      Wilson has mentioned. As ordinary Bell telephone receiver is put into the\\n      circuit of an ordinary induction machine, and you can use it just as the\\n      English people use the audiometer, and as you remove the coil you modify\\n      the vibrations, which is covered with another disk and a tube, and that\\n      tube covered with a stethoscope tube, which is the same as we use for the\\n      phonograph or vibrometer, and, as Dr. Wilson has suggested, you can modify\\n      the intensity, and of course the whole matter is adjusted by the\\n      attachment of the cord, so that you can have fine vibrations. The\\n      intensity of the vibrations is regulated by the distance to which you\\n      uncover the cord. The only difficulty in the adjustment is that it has\\n      been so severe that it is really uncomfortable, and the noise of the\\n      instrument is reduced to the minimum for office use.\\n      \\n A.B. NORTON, M.D.: I will also add that\\n      in regard to the objection Dr. Wilson makes to the noise, there is no\\n      doubt it is an annoying thing in the office, and in that line I have some\\n      men at work on my suggestion. We are devising another machine, or\\n      instrument, which is to be entirely enclosed in a cabinet, so there will\\n      be no noise whatever in the room if it is made a success. The idea is a\\n      little crude, and I am quite uncertain whether it will amount to anything\\n      or not. Then, in the line of what Dr. King was speaking in regard to Mr.\\n      Goodwin-he called, at New York, to see me last week. I made two little\\n      suggestion to him, which I think would be in line with his advancement.\\n      One is the number of the picks. The present vibrometer has four picks I\\n      suggest the experiment of trying twelve or sixteen picks, which will make\\n      a more continuous sound; it may be of some value. Then, in regard to\\n      regulating the speed of the machine: you regulate that now by a series of\\n      buttons, so as to get three different speeds. We will have a very slight,\\n      intermediate speed, and a very rapid speed. My experience with the\\n      vibrometer is especially favorable. I think the idea is in the right\\n      direction, and it is simply a matter of instrumentation.']\n",

Dietary sources of vitamin C include fruits and vegetables, particularly citrus fruits such as oranges.Severe deficiency of vitamin C causes scurvy. Although rare, scurvy results in severe symptoms and can cause death. People with scurvy are treated with vitamin C and should be under medical supervision.Many uses for vitamin C have been proposed, but evidence of benefit in scientific studies is lacking. In particular, research on asthma, cancer, and diabetes remains inconclusive, and a lack of benefit has been found for the prevention of cataracts or heart disease.The use of vitamin C in the prevention or treatment of colds remains controversial. Extensive research has been conducted. Overall, vitamin C lacked an effect on the development of colds and on cold symptoms. However, the duration of the cold shortened slightly. Notably, people living in extreme circumstances, including soldiers in the subarctic, skiers, and marathon runners, had a 50% decrease in the risk of developing a cold. This area merits additional research and may be of particular interest to athletes or people in the military.'\n",

The strongest evidence supporting the use of melatonin is for delayed sleep phase syndrome, insomnia in children and the elderly, jet lag, and sleep problems in people with behavioral, developmental, or mental disorders. The weakest evidence in support of melatonin is for work shift sleep disorder. Good evidence in support of melatonin for other uses is lacking.New drugs that block the effects of melatonin are being developed. These include BMS-214778 and luzindole, and they may have uses in various disorders.'\n",
      " 'Black cohosh is popular as an alternative to hormonal therapy in the treatment of menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes, mood disturbances, excessive sweating, palpitations, and vaginal dryness. Several studies have reported black cohosh may improve menopausal symptoms for up to one year, although the evidence is mixed.The mechanism of action of black cohosh remains unclear. Research suggests that there may be no direct effects on estrogen receptors, although this is an area of active controversy.Safety and efficacy beyond one year have not been proven. Reports suggest the safety of short-term use, including in women with menopausal symptoms for whom estrogen replacement therapy is not suggested. Nonetheless, caution is advised until better-quality safety data are available. There have been reports of liver damage and higher lead levels in the blood from black cohosh. Use of black cohosh in high-risk populations (such as in women with a history of breast cancer) should be under the supervision of a licensed healthcare professional.'\n",
      " 'Beta-carotene is a carotenoid. Carotenoids are red, orange, or yellow, fat-soluble compounds. These compounds are naturally present in many fruits, grains, oils, and vegetables. Alpha, beta, and gamma carotene are considered provitamins because they can be converted to active vitamin A.Commercially available beta-carotene is man-made or taken from palm oil, algae, or fungi. Beta-carotene is converted to retinol, which is essential for vision and growth.Studies in humans show that beta-carotene has promising use for oral leukoplakia (pre-cancerous mouth lesions) and for sunburn. However there was a lack of benefit for sun damaged skin, mole prevention, heart disease risk, infection with H. Pylori, cataract prevention, diabetes, and stroke.Research shows that beta-carotene increased the risk of bladder, lung, stomach, and prostate cancer. Also the general incidence of cancer in asbestos workers, smokers, or high risk individuals increased. Additionally, some research suggested increased risk of heart disease and death with beta-carotene supplementation.'\n",
      " 'L-arginine was first isolated in 1886, reportedly from the extract of a lupine (Lupinus spp.) seedling. Lupinus is a genus in the legume (Fabaceae) plant family.Arginine is an amino acid normally made by the body. Arginine is also found in many foods that have protein.Arginine becomes nitric oxide (a blood vessel-widening agent called a vasodilator) in the body. Early evidence suggests that arginine may help treat medical conditions that improve with increased vasodilation. These conditions include chest pain, atherosclerosis (clogged arteries), heart disease, heart failure, erectile dysfunction, peripheral vascular disease, and headaches from blood vessel swelling).Arginine also triggers the body to make protein and has been studied for healing wounds, bodybuilding, enhancing sperm production, and preventing tissue wasting in people with critical illnesses. However, caution is warranted. Arginine use was associated with death in some people with heart conditions. Caution is also needed when using arginine to treat pre-eclampsia (high blood pressure in pregnancy).Arginine hydrochloride has been used to treat metabolic alkalosis. This use should be under the supervision of a qualified healthcare professional.'\n",
      " 'Flaxseed and flaxseed oil (or linseed oil) are rich sources of the essential fatty acid alpha-linolenic acid (ALA). In the body, some ALA is converted to omega-3 fatty acids.Lignans are a type of plant hormone similar to estrogen. The lignan components of flaxseed (not flaxseed oil) may possess antioxidant properties and alter estrogen activity.As a source of fiber, flaxseed (not flaxseed oil) has laxative properties. In large doses, or when taken without enough water, flaxseed may cause bowel obstruction. The effects of flaxseed on blood sugar levels are unclear.Flaxseed oil contains only the ALA component of flaxseed and not the fiber or lignan components. Therefore, flaxseed oil may share the potential cholesterol-lowering properties of flaxseed, but not the proposed laxative or anticancer abilities.'\n",

      " 'Tresorie - The Present Status of Radiation in the Treatment of Malignant\\nConditions [Present Status Of Radiation in the Treatment Of Malignant\\nConditions]\\n ISIDORE ARONS, M.D.\\n      \\n New York, N.Y.\\n      \\n AT A meeting of the American Medical\\n      Association recently held in Cleveland, Dr. Joseph C.Bloodgood, in\\n      discussing a paper on radiation therapy, said that \"report at my\\n      clinic told me that 49 per cent of the patients previously operated on in\\n      the clinic now to for radiotherapy. This is based on results. They are not\\n      hopeless cases; they are still hopeful and they get well under\\n      radiotherapy. This has happened during the last three years, not because I\\n      have changed any but because the method of radiotherapy has changed. A\\n      great change has taken place. First of all, radium and x-rays are no\\n      longer looked on a last resort.\".\\n      \\n The foregoing bears witness to the\\n      progress made in the field radiation therapy. The manufacture of more\\n      adequate apparatus and the improved technic in its use reflect this\\n      improvement. Machines are used generally delivering twenty to thirty\\n      milliamperes of current at 200 K.V., while machines operating at 750 to\\n      1,000 200 K.V., using lower milliamperes, have been installed in several\\n      places in this country. Since the question of increased voltages began to\\n      dominate the field, machines operating at 400 to 600 K.V., using sealed\\n      tubes, have been manufactured in this country as well as on the been\\n      manufactured in this country as well as on the continent. This higher\\n      powered machines occupy little more space than the usual 200 K.V. machine.\\n      \\n The effectiveness of these stronger\\n      radiations is thought to be due to (1) the increased penetration and its\\n      consequently larger percentage depth doses, (2) the supposed higher\\n      selective action of short have length radiation on malignant cells, and\\n      (3) greatly increased x-ray output. Clinics using super-voltages report\\n      that clinical results are somewhat better than those secured through the\\n      use of the lesser voltage machine.\\n      \\n Experimental effort, from the physical\\n      and biologic point of view, has been exerted to establish to standard\\n      basis for radiotherapy since Roentgens discovery thirtyfive years ago, and\\n      its application five years later. Radiotherapists have only recently begun\\n      to understand the principles of clinical application or radiotherapy in\\n      the treatment of malignant conditions.\\n      \\n Regaud selected the rabbits testicle\\n      for his experiments because its histologic cellular structure was highly\\n      sensitive to radiation, containing cells which are in a state of active\\n      mitosis resembling that of malignant tissue. In 1922, Regaud reported that\\n      of malignant, tissue. In 1922, Regaud reported that it was impossible to\\n      sterilize the testicle by a single dose of radiation without causing\\n      serious damage to the overlying skin. The dose required to produced such\\n      radio necrosis was equivalent to about three radionecrosis was equivalent\\n      to about three erythemas when administered in one dose. However, by\\n      dividing the dose in such a manner as to prolong the treatment over a\\n      period of fourteen days, a total dose of about five erythemas could be\\n      given causing complete sterilizations without damage to the skin. Thus it\\n      is seen that by prolonging the time of treatment the cutaneous dose could\\n      be increased nearly 50 per cent without causing necrosis.\\n      \\n The above experiments were reported,\\n      and the same results determined, by Schinz and Slotopolsky in 1926, and\\n      again by Regaud and Ferroux in 1927. These experiments formed the\\n      foundation for the clinical studies of Pfahler (America), Hohlfelder\\n      (Germany) and Coutard (France), who have swung the pendulum from massive\\n      radiation, as advocated by the German school, to that of the protected\\n      fractional dose method. Results have been achieved by this method which\\n      are superior to previously reported; these are obtained by the improved\\n      method of administering a large dose to the (3 days) without causing\\n      destructive effects to the surroundings normal structure (or cancer bed);\\n      its effect are rather biologic than physical. The clinical application of\\n      the method of radiation by Pfahler, Countard, and Berven (Sweden) in the\\n      treatment of cancer of the tonsil, pharynx and larynx and have proved the\\n      radio-sensitive properties of squamous carcinoma, previously considered\\n      incapable of of responding to radiation.\\n      \\n According to Coutard, the neoplasm is\\n      exposed to x-rays twice daily, giving a total dose of 350 r to400 r to two\\n      areas, using 190 to 200 k.v., four milliamperes, two millimeters of copper\\n      and three millimeters of aluminum filtration at a distance of fifty of\\n      sixty centimeters, for lesion of the head and neck. For deeply situated\\n      lesions, such as cancer of the uterus, the focal distance varies from 80\\n      to 100 centimeters, the area of the field for the head and neck conditions\\n      being only 50 to 100 square centimeters, while those of the lower abdomen\\n      require on an average of 250 to 300 square centimeters. For the\\n      sterilization of the radio-sensitive squamous carcinomatous growth, a\\n      depth dose of 3,000 r to 4,000 r is given, while stronger dose is\\n      necessary for the radio-resistant tumors.\\n      \\n In the course of treatment of principle\\n      guides a radio reaction of the covering epithelium and the radio reaction\\n      of the cancer cells. The radio reaction of the cutaneous epithelium is\\n      called \"radio epidermitis.\"characterized by loss of epithelial\\n      layers and denudation of the dermis. The reaction of the mucous membrane ,\\n      called \"radio epithelitis,\" manifests itself by loss of the\\n      epithelial layer sand denudation of the mucous membrane, epithelial layers\\n      and denudation of the corium which becomes covered by a fibrinous and\\n      false membrane; of clear. The duration of both describe radio reactions is\\n      six weeks. Each appears at the beginning of three weeks and disappears at\\n      the beginning of the ninth week.\\n      \\n Should the total or daily dose or the\\n      intensity per minute be too high, or the filtration or the tension too\\n      low, the cancer bed would be modified. the nutrition of the malignant\\n      cells becomes impaired The cellular radio- sensitivity, which seems to be\\n      linked up not only with the mitosis of the cell but above all with the\\n      activity of their interchange with the cell but above all with the\\n      activity of their interchange with the surrounding normal structures,\\n      becomes diminished and at times suppressed. The cancer cells become\\n      incentive to radiation. This phenomenon is called \"radio-\\n      vaccination\" by Regaud.\\n      \\n Observation of clinical facts shows\\n      that changes in the surrounding normal tissue result from excessive daily\\n      doses and intensity per minute per minute causing radio resistance of the\\n      tissue. Conversely, radio- sensitivity would be prolonged with a smaller\\n      daily dosage and the resultant extended period.\\n      \\n Realizing that better results may be\\n      obtained by prolonged treatment, Coutard and his collaborators in the last\\n      few years have begun to extend the duration of treatment of certain\\n      so-called radio-resistant cancers from thirty to ninety days, giving weak\\n      daily doses in order of about 175, 220, 225 and 250 r per day, dividing\\n      the dose in two treatments. By this method he was able to cure a certain\\n      number of lesions on which he had not been able previously to obtain the\\n      same results, such as very differentiated epidermoid epithelioma invading\\n      the muscles and cartilages, glandular epithelioma of the breast ad the\\n      thyroid body, and special round celled epitheliomas of the upper part of\\n      the ethmoid and the adjacent sinuses. This mode of prolonged treatment not\\n      only controlled the condition locally but it lessened the frequency of\\n      metastasis.\\n      \\n When radiating a cancer of very\\n      embryonic, very radio-sensitive growths, the energy factor is predominant.\\n      The action of the x-rays seems to be direct and rapid; the treatment can\\n      be accomplished within fifteen to twenty days. The cells are destroyed and\\n      generally normal structures are affected very little. When radiating the\\n      less embryonic type of growths, the time of treatment should be longer.\\n      \\n Pursuing these general principles, I\\n      have adopted the Countard method with some slight modifications. The cures\\n      which I shall illustrate will show that the percentage of cures in a\\n      number of most dangerous epidermoid carcinomas has markedly increased and\\n      that some conditions formerly considered hopeless have been temporarily\\n      cured. In conclusion I wish to emphasize the following facts:.\\n      \\n (1) Cure of cancer by x-rays is still\\n      difficult and must not be entered into lightly and causally.\\n      \\n (2) Radiotherapy is just as radical in\\n      method as surgery, and requires great skill, judgment and experience.\\n      \\n (3) The cooperation of the pathologist\\n      and the radiotherapist is imperative for a proper estimate of the\\n      radio-sensitivity in relation to treatment of the lesion.\\n      \\n (4) Daily examination of the patient is\\n      necessary; modification of the normal structure and general reaction by\\n      the x-ray treatment sometimes appears to quickly that it is often\\n      necessary to diminish the daily dose or the size of the field in the\\n      course of treatment.\\n      \\n (5) There exists no fixed method of\\n      treatment, only a simple clinical treatment for each individual patient\\n      and for the special type of tumor..\\n      \\n (6) Improvement in roentgen apparatus\\n      of higher voltages, producing more penetrating rays, will permit a better\\n      relation between destruction of malignant cells and preservation of the\\n      supporting, and the radio sensitivity of the tumor may be prolonged.'\n",

This is the city where\\n      Homoeopathy was first introduced by Rajendra Lal Dutta of hallowed memory,\\n      who spent a princely fortune for dissemination of its principles and\\n      practice among his countrymen. This is the city where took place the\\n      dramatic conversion of one of the then medical luminaries of the first\\n      magnitude, to the practice of Homoeopathy under the influence of Rajendra\\n      Lal. I mean Dr. Mahendra Lal Sircar who became the high priest of\\n      Homoeopathy, spread its glory far and wide and gained thereby an\\n      international reputation for himself. This is the city where the\\n      celebrities of Homoeopathy like Dr. Berigny, Dr. Salzar, Dr. P.C.\\n      Majumdar, Dr. D. N. Roy. Dr. Younan, Dr. J.N. Majumdar, Dr. Baridbaran\\n      Mukherji, Dr. S.K. Nag, Dr. A.N. Mukherji, Dr. T.N. Palit, Dr. G.\\n      Dirghangi and a host of other talented physicians practised their\\n      profession with credit and success and held aloft the banner of\\n      Homoeopathy. This is the city where exist pioneer institutions for the\\n      teaching of Homoeopathy. This is the city wherefrom Homoeopathy has spread\\n      to all parts of India and its votaries are doing yeomans service for the\\n      good of the suffering humanity.\\n      \\n We are meeting this evening on a\\n      historic occasion and we have to arrive at decisions which might make or\\n      mar the future history of Homoeopathy in India. It may be that forces of\\n      disruption, destruction and obstruction are at work; it may be that self\\n      and vested interests seem to thwart the smooth progress of Homoeopathy; it\\n      may be that some may seem to play in the hands of the Powers that are not\\n      too sympathetic to the cause of Homoeopathy; it may be that the present\\n      seems to be chaotic and future of Homoeopathy dubious but great is truth\\n      indeed and will prevail. We should not lose heart or throw up the sponge.\\n      Tradition, authority, sectarianism, dogmatism are great obstacles on the\\n      way. But obstacles and difficulties are meant to be fought out and\\n      overcome. Strifes and dissensions, discords and disunities may hamper our\\n      progress but they are nonetheless signs of lifes activities. It is a good\\n      augury that the Homoeopathic profession is shaking off its age - long\\n      slumber and getting more and more conscious of its duties and obligation,\\n      its rights and privileges and of its short - comings and practical\\n      difficulties. The life of Hahnemann is there to encourage us; the\\n      masterful will of his dynamic spirit is there to inspire us to intensify\\n      our activities; his achievements are there to goad us to realise greater\\n      success; and his personality is always before us to take lessons from, in\\n      our life which as Swami Vivekananda puts it, is \"a process of\\n      unfolding and development of a being under circumstances tending to press\\n      it down.\"\\n      \\n That Homoeopathy is a scientific system\\n      of treatment, philosophically sound, logically unimpeachable, practically\\n      highly efficacious in curing the sick and cheap enough to suit the poor\\n      economic condition of the Indian masses - has become a much talked - of\\n      subject in the country. But why is it not spreading sufficiently and\\n      adequately in our motherland or in fact anywhere in the world? Why is our\\n      National Government not still keen on according official recognition to\\n      this superb system of healing art or providing ways and means for its\\n      development and diffusion? Why the public opinion is not gaining strength\\n      enough to put sufficient pressure on our Government to take interest in\\n      it? Why sufficient number of fully equipped Homoeopathic teaching\\n      institutions and hospitals are not growing to turn out adequate number of\\n      fully qualified Homoeopathic physicians in the country?\\n      \\n It is high time that we should draw the\\n      attention of the profession and the laity to provide answers to so many\\n      \"whys\" and to solve the pressing problems in the matter\\n      concerned. On a cursory view it becomes evident that the Homoeopathic\\n      profession, the people and the Government are each individually and\\n      collectively responsible for this impasse.\\n      \\n The so - called Allopathy still\\n      occupies the dominant place in any country, even in the land of birth of\\n      Homoeopathy. It is no wonder that Homoeopathy, being a discovery of merely\\n      a century and a half still lags behind its rival shool. But it is a wonder\\n      of wonders that Homoeopathy has already encompassed the whole world within\\n      such a short period since it was ushered into existence by Hahnemann.\\n      History of man reveals that nowhere a new truth was accepted by him easily\\n      and readily, obsessed as he is with conservatism, tradition, authority and\\n      vested interests. Nonetheless the triumphant march of Homoeopathy with a\\n      such a meteoric speed throughout the length and breadth of the world is a\\n      proof positive of the truth inherent in the system and phenomenal\\n      therapeutic efficacy of this healing art. It is one more glaring instance\\n      of mans love of truth against heavy odds that impede his progress at every\\n      step.\\n      \\n For the propagation of any new truth\\n      and its acceptance by man, in general, the first and foremost condition is\\n      the turning out of sufficient number of persons who have realised the\\n      truth and are adept in the practice of it. This involves establishment of\\n      a sufficient number of teaching institutions which will turn out experts\\n      in the science and art of Homoeopathy; and a sufficient number of\\n      Homoeopathic Hospital where, the efficacy of this system of treatment will\\n      be put to test.\\n      \\n Human knowledge is becoming\\n      unmanageably vast. The appearance of specialists has become indispensable.\\n      So special Hospitals for the treatment of specific types of diseases have\\n      sprung forth elsewhere, e.g. Tuberculosis Hospitals, Cancer Hospitals,\\n      Hospital for Tropical Diseases etc. Because of organisation of these\\n      hospitals people generally think of getting themselves treated in these\\n      institutions. As there are no fully - equipped general Homoeopathic\\n      Hospitals and not to speak of special Homoeopathic Hospitals and not to\\n      speak of special Homoeopathic Hospitals the result is Homoeopathy is not\\n      getting a fair chance of treating those diseases like tuberculosis,\\n      cancer, acute infectious diseases of epidemic type e.g., Small-pox,\\n      Cholera etc. on a large and organised scale. Consequently the general\\n      public cannot keep much faith in this treatment and mostly take recourse\\n      to homoeopathic treatment when the case is \"past all hope and past\\n      all surgery\". Hence the establishment of fully - equipped\\n      Homoeopathic institutions (College - cum - Hospitals) is an imperative\\n      necessity for enhancing the prestige of the Homoeopathic profession and\\n      for convincing the people about the therapeutic efficacy of this system of\\n      treatment. Is it not a pity that Homoeopathy once established its\\n      reputation by treating Cholera cases in this city and now nobody thinks of\\n      this treatment in Cholera cases and rushes the patient to the Allopathic\\n      Hospitals which are especially meant for these types of patients? How can\\n      we hope to gain ground under these circumstances?\\n      \\n The next great obstacle is the apathy\\n      and in many cases active antagonism of our Government, both at the Centre\\n      and at least in some of the State, towards Homoeopathy. The Government is\\n      under the thumb of its medical directorates which are solely manned by\\n      Allopathic doctors. The main reasons for the non - acceptance of the\\n      Homoeopathic system of treatment may be summed up in three words:\\n      tradition, authority and professionalism. Their psychology is easily\\n      understood if it is borne in mind that the conservative inertia of human\\n      mind attempts to reject any new thought will all the means at its\\n      disposal. Another reason is due to vested interests. Even a cursory glance\\n      at the history of origin and spread of Homoeopathy, enables one to find\\n      out that the opposition to this system from the start, was not scientific\\n      but rather of commercial nature on the part of the apothecaries who were\\n      afraid of losing their trade - profits. We regret to note that the Central\\n      Government have not yet implemented a single recommendation put forward by\\n      the Homoeopathic Enquiry Committee, Planning Commission. Third Health\\n      Ministers Conference, Ad Hoc Committee etc. though Homoeopathic Acts have\\n      been passed in the States of Bombay, U.P., Madhya Pradesh, Travancore -\\n      Cochin, Bihar etc. I is curious to note that W. Bengal is the only State\\n      where a Homoeopathic Bill has recently been thrown out by the State\\n      Government.\\n      \\n Another great obstacle is the\\n      psychology of the general mass of population who fail to adopt a proper\\n      philosophical attitude towards Homoeopathy and takes the Homoeopathic\\n      Therapeutic Law as great paradox contrary to common sense. Unless we can\\n      educate the public in the matter, we cannot hope to secure their whole -\\n      hearted support for this system of treatment.\\n      \\n Lack of enthusiasm for constructive\\n      works on the part of the Homoeopathic profession, the apathy of our\\n      Government and hesitancy on the part of the public to accept Homoeopathy\\n      are great obstacles to the spread of this system of treatment in the\\n      country. Unless this vicious circles is broken the progress of Homoeopathy\\n      is bound to be impeded. We have to fight on all fronts if we aspire to\\n      achieve victory in our battle for the cause of Homoeopathy and the\\n      suffering humanity.\\n      \\n But our first necessity as pointed out\\n      by the Soul of India expressing itself through Sri Aurobindo, is: If India\\n      is to survive and do her appointed work in the world, the youth of India\\n      should learn to think, to think on all subjects, to think independently,\\n      fruitfully, going to the heart of things, not stopped by their surface,\\n      free of pre - judgements, shearing sophism and prejudice asunder as with a\\n      sharp sword smiting down obscurantism of all kinds as with a mace of\\n      Bhima.\\n      \\n \"Let our brains no longer, like\\n      European infants, be swathed with swaddling clothes; let it have recover\\n      the free and unbound motion of the Gods, let it have not only the\\n      minuteness but the wide mastery and sovereignty natural to the intellect\\n      of Bharata and easily recoverable by it if it once accustomes itself to\\n      feel its own power and be convinced of its own worth.\\n      \\n \"The old fixed foundations have\\n      been broken up, we are tossing in the waters of a great upheaval and\\n      change.

      " 'Tresorie - SOME OBSERVATIONS ON NEURASTHENIA AND ITS TREATMENT\\n[Neurasthenia & Treatment]\\n\\n WHEN, thirty-five years ago, the writer\\n      first made the acquaintance of what is now called neurasthenia, it was\\n      known as spinal irritation, and the best of modern researches have been\\n      unable to give a better definition beyond a functional disturbance of the\\n      spinal and cerebral nerves, dependent on a morbid process, for which\\n      \"irritation\" is as proper a term as any. As deaths do not occur,\\n      autopsies throw no light on the subject. Briefly stated, neurasthenia,\\n      when observed from the beginning through its chronic course, has a period\\n      of prodromal symptoms followed by a protracted acute, and succeeded by a\\n      still more protracted chronic, state, between the end of which and the\\n      beginning of convalescence there is a very vague, often indiscernible,\\n      boundary line.\\n      \\n The prodromal symptoms are quite\\n      indefinite and very variable, pointing to nothing in particular. Loss of\\n      appetite, irregular sleep, excitability alternating with lassitude, etc.,\\n      are often overlooked, especially when the second stage-display of unusual\\n      mental and physical energy without subsequent fatigue- becomes apparent.\\n      This is often mistaken for a sign of unusually good health. When a young\\n      girl or mature woman, married or unmarried, feels that she can study ten\\n      hours a day and devote half of her night to pleasure or business; when\\n      besides much mental occupation she begins to rejoice in long walks without\\n      fatigue, that is the time when the mischief is going on without exciting\\n      timely suspicion. Relief is at last sought when the functional disorder of\\n      the nerves has gone to the opposite extreme, and becomes manifest in what\\n      is properly and popularly termed \"nervous prostration,\" when\\n      instead of having no sense of fatigue, the best bodily or mental effort\\n      seems intolerable, in grave cases rendering the patient a helpless being,\\n      completely dependent on the unremitting assistance of others whom she )it\\n      is usually a woman) rules with the inexorable power of the vis inertiae.\\n      \\n During this usually very protracted\\n      period of the disease convalescence usually sets in, but so imperceptibly\\n      that the physician alone can sometimes estimate its progress, which is\\n      unnoticeable to others towards whom the patient acts as she has for months\\n      or years. This is the time for action, too often delayed from motives of\\n      misplaced sympathy on the part of relatives and friends.\\n      \\n The affections is in many instances\\n      limited to the spine, the mind becoming only secondarily tired. In other\\n      cases it is spinal and cerebral; in others again chiefly cerebral. The\\n      line between this and insanity is always clearly definable. Though a\\n      neurasthenic patient may become insane, and probably the reverse, yet both\\n      are distinct conditions.\\n      \\n Books speak of this disease at common\\n      to men and women. Yet in this region in small towns as well as in large\\n      cities the cases of neurasthenia in women are preponderatingly great.\\n      \\n Hypochondriacs and hysteria stand in\\n      peculiar relation to neurasthenia. They maybe regarded as different\\n      species of the same genus; that is, more or less deeply seated\\n      disturbances of the cerebro-spinal system in which the sympathetic system\\n      is probably indirectly involved, as many functional disturbances presided\\n      over by the great sympathetic system often testify. Hypochondriasis, pure\\n      and simple as occurring in men, is easily distinguishable by its striking\\n      characteristic of introspection and despondency, occasioned by abnormal\\n      sensations, without marked physical weakness and tiredness. Pure\\n      hypochondriacs are often energetic, conscientious workers. In hysteria\\n      there is neither great tiredness nor tendency to introspection, but a\\n      paroxysmal or prolonged absence of the power of self control, in grave\\n      cases associated with tonic or clonic muscular spasm and loss of\\n      consciousness. While neurasthenia in its uncomplicated forms is free from\\n      these symptoms, but, as ample experience teaches, often complicated with\\n      both of the preceding forms to such an extent that it is often very\\n      difficult to tell which is primary and which secondary. The symptoms known\\n      as introspection, hysterical aberrations of the emotions, and neurasthenic\\n      sense of exhaustion are in their distinctive manifestations most important\\n      and constitute indications in the selection of remedial and dietetic\\n      measures.\\n      \\n The following are some observation of\\n      peculiarities observed in a large number of cases and peculiar to all:.\\n      \\n Introspection.-The neurasthenic patient\\n      in variably expresses her desire for relief, not so much in a direct\\n      appeal as in a supplicating, subdued tone of voice and manner. She rarely\\n      asks, \"What can you do to relieve me?\" but almost invariably,\\n      \"What is the cause of\" this or that sensation? If she is\\n      introspective, that is, hypochondriacal, she becomes a nosomaniac,\\n      watching acutely every one of her numerous distressing sensation, on the\\n      unremitting analysis of which her mind dwells. In marked cases she is\\n      quite unable to think of anything outside of herself, and in many cases\\n      dislikes to do so, preferring to river her attention on herself. Attempts\\n      to divert her annoy or anger her. Friends and relatives implore the\\n      physician to divert the patient, but all their attempts are in vain\\n      because quite misdirected.\\n      \\n Positive and Negative Will.-It seems\\n      sometimes as if the patient delights in her self-inspection, and that she\\n      prefers her condition to speedy recovery. This is not the case, for the\\n      patient will always assure the physician of her wish to get well. During\\n      the acute stage-a long yet definable period-this wish and longing cannot\\n      well be utilized, but the long and ill-defined period of convalescence\\n      must first be awaited. Here we shall always discover that the wish and the\\n      will of the patient are two very different mental conditions. The desire\\n      or wish for recovery is entirely unattended by any will effort to\\n      accomplish the desired end. The injunctions and directions of the\\n      physician are resisted by the same unconquerable power of negative power,\\n      or vis inertiae. The patient having been unable to exert her will, now\\n      thinks herself unable to use it.\\n      \\n Numerous Symptoms of Patients.-To\\n      physicians in search of indications for medicines each statement of\\n      patient concerning a sensation is apt to be considered as a symptom. Many\\n      years ago, when resolved to get at the keynote of a patient\\'s case, the\\n      writer determined to allow the patient to detail all her symptoms as long\\n      as she chose and to take accurate notes of each one till the right one\\n      should be disclosed; and this was to be done regardless of time and\\n      exertion. The patient, one who needed no urging to describe her\\n      \"symptoms,\" began in an almost inaudible voice, detailing one\\n      sensation after another with an unrivalled degree of clearness and\\n      vividness of expression; as she proceeded the voice became stronger, her\\n      face slightly flushed, and the most perfect descriptive language flowed in\\n      an endless stream. Each word was written down, page after page was filled;\\n      still she went on with unmistakable signs of satisfaction at being able to\\n      pour her pent-up emotions into willing and sympathetic ears. If, for a\\n      moment, the flow of language was interrupted, a simple question would\\n      re-animate her to proceed with renewed energy. Feelings seemed to beget\\n      feelings; their complexity gave the patient no trouble; her intellect was\\n      equal to the action of unraveling the most complicated sensation,\\n      separating them into their component parts and spreading them out before\\n      the mind of the listener. A glance at the watch showed that nearly two\\n      hours had passed, during which the feeblest of neurasthenic patients had\\n      talked incessantly. The note-book was full, the keynote was found. It was\\n      this: neurasthenic patients have innumerable sensation and exhibit no\\n      sings of fatigue after talking incessantly for nearly two hours.\\n      \\n Great Endurance of Neurasthenics.-The\\n      instance just related, which is one of many, illustrates two things. One\\n      is, that it is not the kind of sensation described but the fact that\\n      neurasthenics have innumerable sensations, that constitute the symptoms.\\n      The other thing is that many neurasthenics are capable of great exertion\\n      without suffering disagreeable after- effects from fatigue. This is\\n      illustrated by other cases of which I have notes. A highly neurasthenic\\n      young lady consented to camp out for her health near a lake. She was\\n      induced to join a party for a short walk along the lake. By trying what\\n      they thought a shorter road the party lost their way and took a very long\\n      walk of about four hours, through bogs and over forces. The neurasthenic\\n      was less fatigued than some of the others. The interesting observation was\\n      subsequently made that the patient had become interested in a young man of\\n      the party. She recovered her health within a year from that time. Other\\n      cases of this kind will appear under the head of therapeutic suggestions.\\n      \\n Neurasthenic Patients Crave\\n      Sympathy.-This is one of the most formidable obstacles to the curative\\n      management of such cases, for the kind of sympathy such patients crave is\\n      expressions of condolence and more or less deep affliction at so much\\n      suffering as the patient expresses. Such sympathy is most natural and does\\n      honor to the feelings of parents, sisters, brothers and husbands, but it\\n      is unfortunate that the deeper their expression of affliction so much the\\n      more profound will be the mental dejection and weakness of the patient.\\n      Almost every case which has come under the writer\\'s observation has been\\n      much hampered if not made hopeless by this condition of things, against\\n      which no remedy suggests itself that would not be construed as\\n      \"unkind\".\\n      \\n The origin of this very formidable and\\n      refractory nervous disease, like that of most diseases usually termed\\n      chronic, is either hereditary or acquired, as the histories of every\\n      observed case plainly testify. Either the father was a hypochondriac or\\n      the mother neurasthenic, or both parents were of unsound nervous\\n      constitution. Dipsomania on the part of parents produces neurasthenia in\\n      the children, as readily as it will be followed by any other form of\\n      nervous disease, according to the individual predisposition of the\\n      offspring. The excessive use of tea and coffee is another very active\\n      factor in the history of neurasthenics. Where fathers inclined to alcohol,\\n      mothers are addicted to tea and coffee, which, while its immediate effects\\n      do not obtrude themselves upon our notice, are none the less insidious in\\n      their more remote consequences.\\n      \\n The acquired forms of neurasthenia are\\n      of utmost interest to the therapeutist, and the sources of acquisition are\\n      readily stated. They are much brain-work with insufficient food and sleep.\\n      Such conditions obtain chiefly in women (less frequently in men) of fine\\n      intellectual ability, conscientiousness and ambition. Physical overwork\\n      with unintellectual women has no such effect. Quite analogous to the above\\n      are the conditions of care and sorrow, especially in women who are able\\n      for a long time to conceal and control their emotions. The usual\\n      consequence of such states of mind is disregard of food and insufficient\\n      sleep. Instances of acquired neurasthenia are presented in families of\\n      several girls and boys, where one or more of the former are Neurasthenic\\n      while the latter are vigorous and athletic. Boys delighting in vigorous\\n      exercise do not, as is the case with girls, lose appetite and sleep.\\n      \\n The effects of nervous exhaustion in\\n      boys are usually much less grave than in girls; as a rule such effects are\\n      manifested in mental, not muscular, tiredness, and they are relieved by\\n      air and exercise, while in girls and women those influences are shunned\\n      because they seem to increase the tiredness.\\n      \\n Predisposition-The temperament, or what\\n      in modern pharaseology is called the personal equation, plays a visible\\n      but uncontrollable part in the progress of neurasthenia, as temperament\\n      greatly determines the other imperfectly known condition known as\\n      predisposition. Where the disease is hereditary, it is easy to say that\\n      the predisposition is due to that source; where there is no history of\\n      heredity and where neurasthenia exists in the last members of a\\n      generation, it may be attributed to acquired predisposition which needed\\n      only the exciting cause to establish the disease in its most typical form.\\n      \\n One of the most common forms of\\n      neurasthenia, often quite intractable, results from a serious defect in\\n      our public school system, one which affects chiefly girls from twelve to\\n      fourteen years of age. The following is a brief example: The child rises\\n      late with no appetite for breakfast and no time to eat it if so inclined.\\n      The lessons, however, have been learned the evening before, and the school\\n      work is begun with an ambitions will and a crammed mind, and continues\\n      with one intermission of often not more than ten minutes or three of four\\n      hours. The pupil arrives at home ravenously hungry, eats too fast, and too\\n      much of injudiciously prepared food, too long in digesting to leave room\\n      for an appetite for even a light evening meal, or even for a breakfast the\\n      next morning.\\n      \\n In another case the girl or boy grows\\n      desperately hungry while at school, but being unprovided with food\\n      (lunch), goes on with the school exercises, at the end of which the sense\\n      of hunger has vanished and has been replaced by an aversion to normal\\n      food, with a possible craving for something pungent and indigestible. This\\n      observation can easily be made in many instances, and will, in as many\\n      cases, be seen to lead to nervous prostration, which is then treated by\\n      vile, patented concoctions consisting largely of whiskey, under the name\\n      of \"tonics,\" while the patient needs only the best that a\\n      legitimate market affords prepared in a sensible manner.\\n      \\n Typical Cases Ending in Rapid\\n      Recovery.-Curative results have already been indicated in what has been\\n      said above, and further indications for treatment may be gathered from a\\n      few cases of extremely rapid recovery of apparently incurable cases, to\\n      which brief allusion will here be made. A woman of forty had been a victim\\n      of grave neurasthenia for five years. In the absence of an inclination to\\n      exert himself, she had, during that period, been mostly confined to her\\n      bed or lounge, in the meantime giving birth to two children, going through\\n      gestation and confinement normally, without recovering from neurasthenic\\n      prostration which, in the course of some years more, rendered her entirely\\n      helpless. Her condition was associated with a feeling of dropping to\\n      pieces unless supported and braced by a harness of wood, iron and leather,\\n      in which she \"sat up\" for several hours each day, spending the\\n      rest of the time in bed. Having left the patient in this condition, it was\\n      reported before the writer\\'s next professional visit that Mrs.-had been\\n      cured, and that she was able to go out like other people. A visit to the\\n      house confirmed the report. The patient came to the door herself, and in a\\n      quiet manner, entirely without the least expression of joy or wonder at\\n      her release, stated, that having heard of a famous \"magnetic\\n      physician,\" she summoned him, was ordered by him to arise and stand;\\n      protesting that it was impossible, she was raised to her feet and again\\n      ordered to stand, then to walk. Fearing that she would fall, she begged\\n      the magnetic doctor to support her, which he peremptorily refused, saying\\n      she might fall if she liked. Instead of falling, she had to walk about the\\n      room, was then placed upon a lounge and subjected to a severe treatment of\\n      rolling and pummelling, and then ordered to dress and sit up until tired,\\n      to remain up and about like other people, and to call on the doctor in\\n      future, as he would not come so far to the patient again. This happened\\n      about twenty-five years ago, and the patient has been in very fair health\\n      arrested by insisting that all professional visits by the writer or any\\n      other physician to whose sympathy the patient could appeal must cease.\\n      This injunction was carried out conscientiously with the best results by\\n      the husband of the patient. Perhaps we may learn from this that sometimes,\\n      at least, the familiar motto is reversed, and angels rush in where fools\\n      fear to tread.\\n      \\n Profiting by this experience, another\\n      neurasthenic woman, unmarried, but of most intractable, antagonistic\\n      temperament, confined to her bed, in and out of hospitals, for years,\\n      wearing out the strength and means of her relatives and the patience of\\n      many physicians, was at length abandoned by them. It was a case of spinal\\n      and cerebral neurasthenia complicated with hypochondriasis in its most\\n      trying form of introspective maunderings and endless description of\\n      symptoms. She tormented her advisers by her endless tirades, the\\n      indulgence of which invariably aggravated her condition, and were there\\n      fore avoided, until once her physician yielded to the patient\\'s\\n      importunities for a visit, when be found her in her usual abject state of\\n      prostration. Guided by experience derived from cases like the one first\\n      described, he assisted the patient to her feet and marched her, will you\\n      nil you, up and down the room until he, at least, was thoroughly tired,\\n      and then departed with the promise never to do so again. The patient, on\\n      her part, made a number of her unnameable promises, but kept on her feet\\n      and let the doctors alone. Though not cured of deeply-rooted morbid mental\\n      faults, the neurasthenic phase of her condition had yielded to the change\\n      of the antagonistic element of her character from passive to very\\n      practical activity. A third very serious case of this kind occurred in the\\n      person of a girl of fifteen, of selfish character, who gradually became\\n      bed-ridden with spinal and cerebral neurasthenia, and tormented with the\\n      usual multifarious painful sensations, none of which, on the most\\n      pains-taking physical examination, resulted from demonstrable organic\\n      disease of genital or abdominal organs. The patient was most tenderly\\n      cared for by her mother, who, in the course of years, became so imbued\\n      with the idea of yielding to every wish and whim of the patient, that at\\n      length remonstrance became useless. The mother, though recognizing the\\n      importance of persuading or urging her daughter to depend more on herself,\\n      admitted that she had yielded so long that now she must continue to feed,\\n      dress and assist her charge in the most trivial things. Her food had to be\\n      placed in her mouth, the position of a hand or foot changed by some one\\n      else, although patient did so spontaneously when she chose. This went on\\n      for fifteen years, when the mother, growing old and feeble, died. Her\\n      maternal support being gone, the patient at once proved her ability to\\n      walk, to dress, to feed herself, and to seek light employment. Though far\\n      from well, she is equally far fro being a helpless, bed-ridden invalid.\\n      \\n A fourth case, still very vividly\\n      impressed on the writer\\'s mind, was one of a healthy, romping girl of 14,\\n      who, as happen in this remarkably capricious disease, in the midst of\\n      perfect health, one day took to her bed and remained there with all the\\n      symptoms of neurasthenia, involving first the spinal and finally the\\n      cerebral nerves. This patient was very amiable, conscientious, and\\n      sensible, never loquacious, and not troubled with hypochondriacal thoughts\\n      or sensations. Tiredness was the only expression she used in describing\\n      her feelings. There was literally no variation from this condition, which\\n      confined her to her bed for years, till she grew from a girl to a woman.\\n      Eating and sleeping well, and improving perceptibly in personal appearance\\n      and character, yet she lay on her couch tired and watched over with\\n      unremitting care by a most anxious mother, showing her solicitude and\\n      sympathy in every feature. Once, in the second year of the disease, a\\n      favorable interruption occurred. The mother, still a young woman, gave\\n      birth to another child. During her confinement the neurasthenic patient\\n      was in charge of her mother\\'s nurse, assisted by other servants. The\\n      nurse, while devoted to the daughter, agreed with the writer that excess\\n      of sympathy was injurious, and used her best and judicious endeavors\\n      gradually to persuade the patient to make some physical effort at walking\\n      and standing. In this she was so successful that in two weeks she\\n      accompanied the girl on half-mile walks up and down hill, finally without\\n      assistance. Thus, recovery seemed assured, and everything was favorable\\n      progressing towards it when the mother, having fully recovered, again took\\n      charge of her daughter, with the result that she at once took to her\\n      lounge and remained there two years longer. About that time other advice\\n      was urged and gladly acceded to, with the result that the case was\\n      diagnosed by an eminent surgeon as spinal paralysis in consequence of\\n      concussion, though it could never be shown when and where it occurred.\\n      Salves, plasters, anodynes, nervines, and electricity did no good, but\\n      effectually destroyed appetite and digestion, which higher to had been\\n      normal. So this adviser resigned in favor of a third, who, being a younger\\n      and less prejudiced man, agreed perfectly with the writer\\'s original\\n      opinion. He advised return to moderate exercise, avoidance of drugs, and\\n      less display of sympathy. This, though formerly rejected as\\n      \"unkind,\" was now acceded to as coming from a nerve- specialist,\\n      fresh from Europe, at that time very rare. Still attending the other\\n      members of the family, the writer had sample opportunity of observing the\\n      course of the case. Improvement was very slow and uncertain till financial\\n      misfortune overtook the family. Almost with a bound our patient left her\\n      cough, and, organizing a kindergarten, strove energetically in supporting\\n      herself and assisting her mother. The change came about in less than three\\n      weeks, and resulted in perfect recovery.\\n      \\n At this point another very instructive\\n      case of very speedy recovery, after six or seven years of neurasthenic\\n      prostration, deserves to be mentioned. A woman of 35 had been in bed and\\n      on the lounge most of the time for nearly seven years, at the end of which\\n      time she became my patient, her regular medical attendant having gone to\\n      Europe. She was of very amiable disposition and as sensitive as she was\\n      weak. Her symptoms, as in the other cases, were instantaneous exhaustion\\n      on the least physical exertion. She could give herself up to no mental\\n      occupation beyond directing her house-hold affairs, the education of her\\n      son, and the rehearsal of her numerous sensations. She had not been my\\n      patient long when her husband failed in business, so that the family was\\n      reduced from very comfortable circumstances to a condition which made it\\n      necessary for the patient to make her own living and that of the family.\\n      This she almost at once proceeded to do, setting aside all other\\n      considerations and establishing a boarding-house, where she did most of\\n      the work herself. This she has done now for ten or twelve years without a\\n      serious relapse. The time involved in the period of convalescence was\\n      scarcely more than three weeks, a although her work maybe said to have\\n      begun at the moment her resolution was taken.\\n      \\n Prognostics.-From these and other cases\\n      in and outside of the writer\\'s practice, it is safe to say that the\\n      majority of cases of neurasthenia recover, though years may elapse before\\n      that period. We learn, furthermore, that recoveries, especially of very\\n      inveterate cases, depend on conditions beyond the control of the\\n      physician, as was the case in the above-recorded instances, where\\n      circumstances forced the patient to cases to wish for recovery and to make\\n      an effort of the will. This having been once accomplished self-confidence,\\n      for a long time in abeyance, was permanently restored.\\n      \\n Curability, further, depends very much\\n      on the temperament of the patient, whether amiable, tractable and\\n      confiding in the honest endeavors of the physician, or whether refractory,\\n      suspicious, untruthful, selfish and antagonistic, of a disposition\\n      impossible to win over on account of unnatural distrust of every\\n      well-meaning person. The degree of intelligence of patients also has a\\n      pronounced influence on the result. The most readily curable cases are\\n      those acquired without hereditary predisposition, where the cause is found\\n      in the absence of food and sleep, also where sorrow and anxiety can be\\n      averted or counteracted by judicious conduct of near relatives and\\n      friends.\\n      \\n Dietetic Treatment.-This, as medicinal\\n      treatment, must be governed by the stage at which the case comes into the\\n      physician\\'s hands-whether yet in its prodromal, its acute or its chronic\\n      phase. The prodromal stage of the disease has no very decided\\n      pathognomonic signs. The most that can be recognized in this stage is that\\n      the patient\\'s habits or duties are of a kind which will eventually lead to\\n      obdurate neurasthenia if not arrested in time by removing the exciting\\n      causes. Too much pleasure, as well as too much care, especially in girls\\n      and woman, tends to neglect of food and rest, in the absence of which,\\n      excitements, whether of pleasure or care, begets a state of unrest in\\n      which repose is disagreeable. With such a condition comes a list of\\n      incipient casual complaints of headache, imperfect sleep, notional ways of\\n      eating, working or playing. A few questions will determine whether the\\n      patient is living according to normal or abnormal habits with regard to\\n      appetite, sleep and occupation. Where these are found, their alteration to\\n      normal ways must be instead on. It is unnecessary to say that this is\\n      easier said than done, for it will probably meet with serious objections\\n      on the part of the patient, if not on that of her relatives; for most\\n      likely she has examinations for college to prepare for, involving several\\n      months of dose and careful study at night, and the patient cannot waste\\n      time in sleeping and eating while cramming that little excited and\\n      ambitions brain. A failure in the examinations would be as much of a\\n      disappointment to parents as to patient, who proves, as usual, that this\\n      appellation is a misnomer. She accordingly goes in as she please, lied by\\n      an increasing morbidly ambitions impulse, and the result is likely to be\\n      the mournful satisfaction on the part of the physician of being obliged to\\n      say, \"I told you before what would happen.\" Of course, all\\n      regret the now evident nerve-prostration, while, if the doctor had\\n      succeeded in enforcing his rules, he would in many cases experience the\\n      still more painful reproach of having been too severe. Nevertheless,\\n      absolute firmness and a kindly but unflinching exertion of his will,\\n      without the least compromise, reward the physician with the best results\\n      in such cases.\\n      \\n When the case, after the stage of\\n      excitement and untiring restlessness (at which it would still be speedily\\n      curable by simple dietetic rules) has, after weeks or months, entered upon\\n      the phase of painful prostration, here we encounter backache, oppressive\\n      headache, and absolute loss of mental or bodily endurance, measures of\\n      dietetic management are much less effective and much more difficult to\\n      find. it is at this stage that slight rise of temperature will occur,\\n      especially towards evening; then the backache and headache disappear, the\\n      pallor is replaced by a flush of color, the eyes lose their listless look,\\n      and the patient is inclined to enter upon some diversion or excitement,\\n      followed by a restless night and a morning of exhaustion and a renewal of\\n      all painful sensations. Most of such patients feel much better in the\\n      evening when they are ready for some entertainment, while in a normal\\n      state this would be the time for relaxation and repose.\\n      \\n The dietetic treatment of this stage is\\n      methodical rest. In severe cases the patient will do well to remain in bed\\n      for several days or even for weeks. It is well to shorten this period as\\n      much as possible and to insist on walking about, or, at least. sitting for\\n      a specified time every day. This may be varied b equally specified periods\\n      of rest in the recumbent position.\\n      \\n Irregularities of eating are at this\\n      and at all times to be superseded by the most rigid regularity of meals.\\n      The traditional and conventional three-meal system, however well adapted\\n      to the needs of a vigorous man or woman, does not agree with the\\n      neurasthenic patient. It is much better that these should eat oftener;\\n      four times a day is best in most cases, for the simple reason that in this\\n      way a patient, while eating less at a time, consumes more food in the\\n      aggregate.\\n      \\n As neurasthenic patients are rarely\\n      troubled with absolute aversion to wholesome food, they are generally able\\n      to consume a liberal quantity, about which it is only needful to remark\\n      here that the food should be selected from among the articles and dishes\\n      which the patient likes, provided they belong to the order of good, normal\\n      articles of food, to the exclusion of those which simply please the taste\\n      without being digestible. A dish entirely of meat or \"animal\\n      food\" is as far from being a good diet for neurasthenics as one\\n      consisting entirely of \"vegetable\" food. As a rule, the diet\\n      list should comprise one-third of nitrogenous material and two-thirds of\\n      carbohydrates. Together with these, it is a great mistake to neglect the\\n      fats, such as good butter and the fats of meats. And, lastly, every\\n      patient of this kind should be made to drink some water often, a dietetic\\n      feature too often neglected.\\n      \\n During this stage, actually fatiguing\\n      exercise of body and mind should be avoided, while, on the other hand, the\\n      patient\\'s mind should be directed away from herself, in which she is much\\n      assisted by withholding a certain kind of emotional sympathy, quite as\\n      natural as it is difficult to repress on the part of affectionate persons.\\n      Of this, a few words further on.\\n      \\n There is no definite time for the\\n      duration of this stage, which, however, depends largely on the time during\\n      which the exciting causes have acted, either aided by or without a\\n      predisposition. It is certain, however, that the sooner it is recognized\\n      and the exciting causes eliminated, so much the sooner recovery will\\n      begin. But there is a stage at which the best of experience and judgment\\n      often fail, especially in very inveterate cases. If the case is one of a\\n      patient whom the physician has had opportunity of watching at least since\\n      the earlier stages, the difficulty is not so great as it is in old cases\\n      months or even of several years\\' duration which come to treatment late. In\\n      these, the line between the intermediate stage and incipient convalescence\\n      cannot be drawn. The patient is as neurasthenic and hypochondriacal as\\n      ever; cannot bear the slightest mental or bodily exertion, not even a word\\n      or a look, without sings of apparent exhaustion, while nearly the whole\\n      time is spent in bed under anxious care of sympathetic attendants. In such\\n      cases, having become assured, by careful physical examination, of the\\n      absence of organic disease, seeing the patient generally well nourished\\n      and in fair muscular condition, the physician is warranted in assuming\\n      that the disease has run its course, that whatever morbid (pathological)\\n      process there may have been progressing in the nervous system, this\\n      process has now come to and end, but it has left the patient\\'s mental\\n      condition habituated to the moods of the past months or years, and fixed,\\n      as it were, indelibly in the memory. It is the habit that now remains, not\\n      the disease.\\n      \\n If reasonably sure of this, and calling\\n      to mind the rapid recoveries and the circumstances attending them, as\\n      above detailed, the physician is now safe in ordering a more energetic\\n      treatment, calculated to rouse the self-reliance of the patient. All\\n      visible signs of sympathy must now be set aside; the actins and demeanor\\n      of the attendants should, from this time, if not before, be changed so as\\n      to give the patient the impression that she is no longer an invalid, but\\n      expected to rely on her own exertion. Instead of being fed, the food\\n      should be placed where she must go for and eat it. She should now be\\n      expected to dress and attend, without assistance, to her natural wants.\\n      This, with some temperaments, is almost impossible, with al extremely\\n      difficult. The best course to pursue is to remove such patients from\\n      sympathetic relatives or friends, and to place them in charge of kind,\\n      reliable, but eminently practical nurses.\\n      \\n The first effect of this is either to\\n      throw the patient into a stage of helpless despondency, which, again\\n      appealing powerfully to the sympathies of those nearest to her, often\\n      frustrates the physician\\'s plans which, if firmly but kindly adhered to,\\n      would, ere long, prove of their superiority by signs of returning\\n      self-reliance and absence of complaints on the part of the patient. A\\n      second form of effect is that occurring in patients of obstreperous,\\n      selfish disposition, whose opposition and even anger is aroused by being\\n      thrown on their own resources after the removal of depressing and\\n      unpractical sympathy. This opposition or temper, often manifested in all\\n      sorts of intrigues and subterfuges on the part of the patient, if not\\n      supinely yielded to by sympathetic persons, will finally be replaced by a\\n      more rational disposition. On the whole, anger or active opposition are\\n      signs of returning energy, which, once coming to the consciousness of the\\n      patient, takes the form of self- reliance. it is this way that the cures\\n      of chronic cases above related can be explained, and physicians should\\n      profit by such experience for the benefit of their patients.\\n      \\n The general dietetic management now\\n      readily follows from what has been said, and needs only a few general\\n      modifications. The first duty of the physician will be to test the degree\\n      of reliance to be placed on the patient and her friends, ad to win them\\n      over if possible to his plans, and his success will be in proportion to\\n      the degree of confidence he is able to inspire. This personal confidence\\n      should not degenerate into a mere personal liking or attachment of a\\n      sympathy-craving neurasthenic who should discover henceforth that all\\n      sentimental expressing of sympathy are about to take a practical form,\\n      aiming at a definite result-the patient\\'s health-which she wishes but\\n      cannot exert her will to attain. The best and often the only way to do\\n      away with sentiment and to reach practical kindness is to remove the\\n      patient from certain home influence, and to place her in a hospital or\\n      elsewhere under the management of competent nurses who, without being\\n      selfish, know how to exert a certain amount of wholesome push as fast as\\n      the patient can bear it. Without the removal of sentimental sympathy, all\\n      efforts at counteracting the purely hypochondriacal side of neurasthenia\\n      are useless.\\n      \\n In these cases of neurasthenia as yet\\n      uncomplicated with the hypochondriacal element of introspective nosomania,\\n      there is only one unconditional rule to be followed, especially in\\n      acquired cases whose evident cause was incessant, conscientious work of\\n      mind and body, together with insufficient food and sleep. Such cases come\\n      on very insidiously, the loss of strength-that is, the actual waste of\\n      nerve-substance-being just a trifle grater than the quantity restored, the\\n      patient unconsciously using up a minute part of her capital every day.\\n      Here the rule should be to reverse matters to insuring a supply of\\n      nourishment and time for its assimilation greater than was the case\\n      heretofore. The case of young school-girls belong in this class. The time\\n      of food and rest should be carefully controlled at home, the duty of the\\n      physician being to educate indifferent and ignorant parents up to an\\n      appreciation of the nature of the case. It is generally not difficult to\\n      open their eyes through the medium of their anxiety concerning their\\n      children\\'s health. Having thus insured sufficient rest and food at home,\\n      the physician\\'s next object of attention should be the regulations of the\\n      school. Here is the point where teachers have an opportunity of exerting\\n      their most practical influence. It should be made obligatory on the part\\n      of teachers to institute inquiry as to whether pupils have had their meals\\n      before coming to school. This they could often ascertain without a\\n      question, by reading the pupil\\'s condition in her emaciated form, pale\\n      face and nervous manner. To guard against neglect at home, it would be an\\n      easy matter to insist that all pupils of public and private schools should\\n      bring with them some proper food. The few who do so generally bring\\n      sweets-an apple, orange or a few dry crackers-when a piece of good bread\\n      and slice of cold meat would be what they actually need. All pupils should\\n      pass inspection, and if remiss in this important particular, the\\n      delinquent should be dismissed with several marks against her. To expect\\n      this of teachers would be a great advance in the place of futile\\n      innovations of endeavoring to send forth from our common schools graduates\\n      in arts and sciences.\\n      \\n Sudden Effects.-A large number of cases\\n      of neurasthenia, especially those complicated with inveterate\\n      Hypochondriasis, are frequently traced to some sudden occurrence, having\\n      the effect of a mental or physical shock. In one patient, a vigorous girl,\\n      used to romping, climbing and running lie a boy, the cause was supposed to\\n      be a slight thump she received during a game of blindman\\'s-buff. She\\n      thought nothing of it at the time, but it was suggested long after the\\n      patient\\'s illness began. In another case some mental shock of joy or\\n      grief, not very severe and such as is often experienced in every person\\'s\\n      life, is the beginning of months of nervous prostration.\\n      \\n There is quite an array of evidence\\n      that neurasthenia which has entered upon a hypochondriacal stage or\\n      complication with or without a strong hysterical admixture, is curable by\\n      sudden impressions in the form of a shock, or more gradually by frequent\\n      repetitions of an impression. Such cases, as I have shown above, occur\\n      most commonly in the stage when what may be considered the essential\\n      pathological disturbances of function have run their course and have left\\n      the patient in a state of mental disturbance which indicated that the\\n      patient\\'s recovery depends entirely upon her volition. But there is none,\\n      and so far nothing has succeeded in arousing it. Persuasion is as useless\\n      and irritating, as argument would be in a case of insanity with a fixed\\n      illusion. The resemblance between this and the state of mind of a\\n      hypochondriacal neurasthenic is very close. She cannot move nor thick.\\n      Exhaustion overcomes her and keeps her its victim for years, when suddenly\\n      the scene changes, and a few days or weeks suffice to restore the patient\\n      to activity. In one instance it is attributed to medical, in another to\\n      \"mind cure,\" in a third to \"Christian science;\" in\\n      still other cases massage has done it, in others again \"magnetic\\n      influence,\" in others the very powerful factor necessity. It is\\n      certain that cases of this kind, produced by sudden effects on the mind of\\n      a predisposed person, are also cured by such effects. Whatever the visible\\n      form of these effects may be -whether that of \"Christian\\n      science,\" joy, grief or absolute inexorable necessity, there is\\n      always to be noticed a certain force and condition involving the modern\\n      idea of suggestion, which comes to the patient in an irresistible degree\\n      and now sets the function of the will in motion again.\\n      \\n Experience teaches that it is by no\\n      means a matter of indifference which of these forms of effect are brought\\n      into action. In one case it is the professional Christian scientist\\'s\\n      method, in another the almost brutal exertion of a person\\'s will combined\\n      with some physical force. In either case the patient is aroused from his\\n      inertia, and discovers his powers of mental and bodily ability to act.\\n      \\n A deplorable result is that recoveries\\n      after such effects are attributed in the popular mind to supernatural\\n      causes. That such is not the case may be gathered form instances occurring\\n      in very sensible and intelligent patients, whose reason is scarcely ever\\n      so far disturbed and weakened that they do not resent the proposition of\\n      trying, e.g., Christian science or mind cure.\\n      \\n Nevertheless, it is the mind cure which\\n      the intelligent patient needs quite as much as the ignorant and\\n      superstitious person; the difference is only the form in which the\\n      influencing force is applied. While in one case it is obedience to the\\n      candidly expressed instructions of the physician, in the other case the\\n      result is the to mystification. In either case it is the powerful stimulus\\n      of hope and aroused confidence that recovery will be realized.\\n      \\n The definition of suggestion does not\\n      fully cover the meaning, because the influence employed is greater than\\n      mere suggestion. The physician\\'s plan of action should be straightforward\\n      assurance of recovery, a direct appeal to hope, and an unceasing endeavor\\n      to arouse the self-reliance of the patient, not so much by verbal\\n      exhortations as by a manner and department from which the patient learns\\n      more readily than from words what is expected. If the attitude of the\\n      physician is appreciated, and seconded by the relatives and attendants, a\\n      favorable result is much more certain to follow.\\n      \\n Hypnotism is not advisable. There are\\n      now existing ancient neurasthenic invalids dating from the times of\\n      spiritualism when they were famous \"mediums.\" Hypnotism weakness\\n      the will and nervous endurance, and produces a predisposition to emotional\\n      nervousness with an intractable erotic admixture. The suggestions sought\\n      to be instilled into a hypnotized patient amount to nothing. The mental\\n      influence of mystical treatment administered while the patients is awake\\n      is much more powerful in awaking hope and confidence than the uncertain\\n      effects of an abnormal state like that of hypnotism. Mystification, again,\\n      though sometimes unavoidable with the best intention, is less powerful\\n      than direct and intelligible encouragement. While resort to mystification\\n      should be shunned by reputable physicians, the question arises as to what\\n      shall be done with the many who, from lack of intelligence or education,\\n      are entirely beyond the reach of honest common sense, and who will persist\\n      in mystifying themselves, who remain neurasthenic invalids in spite of the\\n      best regulations of the physician, and who do not recover unless their\\n      encouragement follows some mystical formalities which alone arouse their\\n      \"faith\" and finally their confidence and will-power. For the\\n      present there is no way out of the dilemma but to submit such patients to\\n      the suggestive methods of what is popularly known as mind cure and\\n      Christian science. In doing so, physicians should use their influence as\\n      far as possible in selecting the most honest persons of this class.\\n      \\n DISCUSSION.\\n      \\n JAMES C. WOOD, M.D.: I have nothing but\\n      words of praise for Dr. Wesselhoeft\\'s excellent paper. It is very evident\\n      that the author\\'s inspiration came not from books but from actual contact\\n      with neurasthenic subjects, for the impress of originality is most\\n      conspicuous. It is a production which could only come from one of\\n      experience and from a reasoner. I consider it a most valuable contribution\\n      to the literature of that now most interesting subject,\\n      \"neurasthenia\".\\n      \\n The doctor, in his paper, has sometimes\\n      used the term \"neurasthenia\" instead of\\n      \"neurasthenia.\" The first of these means, according to Thomas,\\n      great nervous power or excitement; the second, nervous debility. I taken\\n      it from the context that the subject dealt with is neurasthenia. To the\\n      average mind there exists what seems to me a needless confusion regarding\\n      the terms, nervous prostration, hysteria and hystero-neurosis. As I\\n      understand these terms they define distinct conditions, though there is a\\n      frequent blending the one with the other. The term nervous prostration,\\n      which is a synonym of neurasthenia, defines itself; the term hysteria\\n      should be restricted to those general neuroses characterized particularly\\n      by psychical manifestations, though not infrequently by motor, sensory,\\n      secretory, vasomotor and reflex derangements as well; while the term\\n      hysteroneurosis implies the uterine origin of symptoms manifesting\\n      themselves in organs remote from the uterus without structural changes in\\n      such organs, being the direct result of reflex nervous influence starting\\n      from the uterus. The last term does not occur in the paper under\\n      discussion. From the standpoint of a gynecologist I think that this is\\n      misleading.\\n      \\n Let us see why and how it is that these\\n      three conditions (I will not call them diseases) are so frequently\\n      associated. I think that all will admit the frequent occurrence in woman\\n      of reflex symptoms, the result of pelvic lesions. An irritation staring\\n      form the pelvis is conveyed to the genito-spinal centre, thence to any or\\n      all organs with which this centre communicates. The organ oftener involved\\n      than any other is the stomach. This is shown by the frequent occurrence of\\n      nausea and vomiting following conception. The nervous system may have been\\n      previously involved, but oftener it becomes so only after the nutrition is\\n      depraved, which, sooner or later, occurs if the pelvic lesion is not\\n      removed. The depraved blood fails to supply the nerve centres with that\\n      which they need to sustain them, and they become anaemic. Prostration is\\n      but a subjective manifestation of the anaemia, and it varies in degree\\n      from a slight indisposition to the most abject helplessness.\\n      \\n If, then, nervous prostration may have\\n      its beginning in a pelvic lesion, is it possible for a pelvic lesion to be\\n      inaugurated by systemic disturbances? Personally, I believe that it is,\\n      and offer this explanation as the modus operandi by which such a lesion is\\n      induced: Marked circulatory changes nearly always attend nervous\\n      prostration. The circulation is presided over by the vaso-motor system,\\n      and wear and repair depend upon the proper regulation of this system. If\\n      it becomes disturbed, the bloodvessels dilate or contract unduly, with\\n      resulting local hyperaemia or local anaemia, as the case maybe. The\\n      climacteric flushes are the result of such disturbance. The alternate\\n      coldness and heat of the extremities, so often associated with rectal and\\n      uterine lesions, is another familiar illustration. If the brain is\\n      involved, either insomnia or drowsiness occur, depending upon whether the\\n      brain is anaemic or hyperaemic. Flatulence, gastralgia, and nervous\\n      dyspepsia result when the stomach is similarly affected. The womb and the\\n      ovaries, because of the periodical congestion imposed upon them, are\\n      oftener implicated by these unnatural circulatory disturbances than any of\\n      the pelvic organs, and in time also become unduly hyperaemic or anaemic,\\n      as the case may be.\\n      \\n It will thus be seen that nervous\\n      prostration may exist independently of pelvic lesions, or, conversely,\\n      pelvic lesions may exist independently of nervous prostration.\\n      Nevertheless, the two are frequently associated, and this fact ought, I\\n      believe, to be kept in mind in dealing with the affection known as\\n      neurasthenia. Hysterical manifestations nearly always come to the surface\\n      in nervous prostration, and they also frequently attend pelvic lesions.\\n      Indeed, the term \"hystero-psychosis\" has been coined for the\\n      purpose of defining certain psychical disturbances of presumably pelvic\\n      origin, and in the broadest sense neurasthenia is not uncommonly an\\n      hysteroneurosis. It is the frequent association of these three conditions\\n      which, it seems to me, makes it more practicable to study them conjointly.\\n      \\n The special symptoms of nervous\\n      prostration are most variable. Introspection, as Dr. Wesselhoeft has\\n      pointed out, makes of the patient a nosomaniac. The anaemic nerve centres\\n      are unduly impressionable, and a mental shock which would not seriously\\n      affect a stronger and more rugged woman falls with crushing force upon one\\n      whose nutrition is already depraved. In this way are developed disorders\\n      of sensibility, alternations of mobility, circulatory disturbances,\\n      anomalies of secretion and exertion, disorders of the gastro-intestinal\\n      canal, dermatoses, and general and psychical disturbances of all kinds.\\n      Many of these affections start from pelvic lesions, and are nearly always\\n      associated with depravity of nutrition and more or less nervous\\n      prostration.\\n      \\n Some of the worst symptoms of\\n      neurasthenia with which I have had to contend have been hyperaesthesia of\\n      the articulations, giving rise to the so-called \"hysterical\\n      joint.\" Here the prostration is usually not profound, and it is\\n      possible to apply the somewhat energetic treatment recommended by Dr.\\n      Wesselhoeft. I remember one case very distinctly, the detailed history of\\n      which I shall give in another place, which brought me much reputation\\n      because of the \"remarkable\" cure I was fortunate enough to make.\\n      \\n The patient, a beautiful girl of\\n      eighteen, had been bed- ridden for three years with supposed hip-joint\\n      disease. She was in college before assuming the ride of an invalid, and\\n      worried much over her studies and work. She sustained a fall a short time\\n      previously to taking to her bed, and to this fall the injury to the hip\\n      was attributed. She had been from physician to physician and from\\n      sanitarium to sanitarium without receiving benefit. All of the numerous\\n      medical men under whose care she had been, directed their attention to the\\n      hip and applied the classical treatment for morbus coxarius without avail.\\n      The patient had finally reached a point where introspection was her chief\\n      occupation and her mind dwelt almost continually upon a \"diseased\\n      hip.\" She was finally brought to me, coming in an invalid\\'s chair and\\n      looking the very picture of dependency. There was a slight degree of\\n      anaemia, though this was not marked. Notwithstanding the expression\\n      expression of abjectness the girl did not look seriously ill. The hip was\\n      excessively tender upon pressure, but there was no local increase of\\n      temperature, no evidences of fever and suppuration, and forcible\\n      apposition by striking the heel was not very painful. More less spastic\\n      contraction of the flexor muscles of the affected side existed, which gave\\n      to the limb an appearance of actual shortening, which was very deceptive.\\n      Hysterical symptoms were common. On examination I found the left ovary\\n      exquisitely tender. Compression of the ovary increased the pain in the hip\\n      most decidedly and gave rise to much nervous agitation. I did not,\\n      therefore, deem it wise to recommend local treatment other than the daily\\n      use of the hot douche. She had long been a victim of ovarian\\n      dysmenorrhoea. I placed upon the ankle of the affected limb three pounds\\n      of bar-lead, prescribed a pair of crutches and insisted upon her walking.\\n      The lead was used to overcome the spastic contraction as well as for its\\n      moral effect. I did not deem the joint lesion of such a character as to\\n      used extension. In two months\\' time this patient discarded her crutches\\n      for a cane. Six weeks later she put up the cane and is now perfectly well.\\n      \\n This was a case in which somewhat harsh\\n      measures were eminently appropriate.\\n      \\n In marked contrast to the case just\\n      recorded is the following: Mrs.-, aet. 47, widow for twenty years. She is\\n      a devoted church-woman, and for years was a leader in all charitable work\\n      done in the community in which she resided. Through friends she was urged\\n      to consult me, and I think that the call to the neighboring town in which\\n      she lived was countermanded at least four or five times before the finally\\n      mustered up courage and strength enough to see me. Upon reaching the\\n      bedside I found my patient in a room made dark by closed blinds, over\\n      which were hung heavy blankets to shut out every ray of light. The mirror\\n      was turned toward the wall for fear a ray of light might strike it and\\n      flesh throughout the darkened room. Nor did the patient rest under these\\n      extreme precautions, for the eyes were protected with two pairs of colored\\n      glasses with side attachments. Hyperaesthesia of the sense of hearing was\\n      equally marked and the noise was excluded from the room by double doors\\n      whose keyholes were stuffed with cotton. She l so had her ears filled with\\n      cotton, over which she wore ear-mufflers. She was emaciated to an extreme\\n      degree, and had been reduced to her miserable condition by a series of\\n      events which frequently precede profound neurasthenia. Her husband was\\n      killed during the war, and she was left childless. Twelve months previous\\n      to taking to her bed she nursed her mother through a long and fatal\\n      illness. This greatly prostrated her, yet she kept up until a favorite\\n      brother-in-law was thrown from a carriage and killed. This was the last\\n      straw, and the shock compelled her to take to her bed. In due time loss of\\n      appetite with irritability of the stomach developed, which, of course, led\\n      to marked depravity of nutrition. With the anaemia came hyperaesthesia of\\n      the special senses, spinal irritation, headache, hysterical\\n      manifestations, etc. There was no series pelvic lesion, although she had\\n      been much treated for an alleged uterine displacement with congestion.\\n      Unfortunately, she was encouraged, instead of discouraged, in her\\n      invalidism, and she soon became a nosomaniac of the worst type. She had\\n      written down her symptoms one at a time, and the record is such a typical\\n      one that I should like to give it in full, but time forbids.\\n      \\n With great difficulty the patient was\\n      moved on a cough to a private hospital and placed under the Weir Mitchell\\n      treatment. I ignored the pelvic trouble entirely. It is unnecessary to\\n      give in detail the progress of the case from day to day after this\\n      treatment was inaugurated. Suffice it to say that the improvement was of\\n      the most marked character, and in six weeks from the time she entered the\\n      hospital she walked to her carriage with her eyes and ears unprotected.\\n      She soon resumed her church and charitable work, in which she again takes\\n      much delight.\\n      \\n This woman wanted to get well. She was\\n      a woman of pure motives and high ideals. She had, in the language of Dr.\\n      Wesselhoeft, the wish, but, unaided, not the will. She required the aid of\\n      an intelligent, strong-minded, nurse who could bring to her exercise\\n      applied in such a way as to enable her to assimilate food without the\\n      expenditure of nerve force. She co- operated with her physician and nurse\\n      in every possible way, and as soon as the anaemic nerve cells became\\n      flushed with new blood she began to improve. To have commanded this\\n      patient \"to take up her bed and walk\" before improving her\\n      nutrition would have been as unscientific as to have placed the first\\n      patient in bed with extension and counter-extension applied to the limb. I\\n      know of no class of cases requiring for their successful treatment more\\n      tact and discrimination than that under consideration.\\n      \\n I feel confident that I have many times\\n      cut the affection short in its prodromal stage by removing the girl from\\n      college work and insisting upon open-air exercise. Static electricity has,\\n      in my hands, proved exceedingly useful both during the prodromal stage and\\n      that of convalescence.\\n      \\n I will conclude by saying that I have\\n      been impressed with the frequency with which an hereditary history of\\n      epilepsy has been met with in the cases of neurasthenia passing under my\\n      observation.'\n",
      " 'Tresorie - SOME OF THE DISEASES PREVENTING AND COMPLICATION PREGNANCY\\n[Diseases Preventing & Complicating Pregnancy]\\n\\n STERILITY.-DeSinety, Treub, Furbinger,\\n      et al., attribute 50 per cent. of unproductive marriages to the husbands,\\n      saying that sterility in the male is more often the cause of barren\\n      marriages than is generally supposed.\\n      \\n This cause of sterility I pass by, as\\n      also sterility due to mechanical obstruction, incomplete ovulation and the\\n      numerous other causes of this condition, too manifold for mere\\n      enumeration, to consider obesity as a causative agent in this condition. I\\n      need not say that the advocates for surgical interference for the relief\\n      of this condition are legion. Sims makes the assertion that sterility can\\n      be cured by surgical means only. That, of course, is Allopathic arguing\\n      pure and simple. Cases requiring surgical interference do arise, but any\\n      treatment which raises the nutrition of the entire organism, improves the\\n      blood-formation, and favors the resorption of pathological products in the\\n      sexual organs, is to be regarded as the indicated remedy.\\n      \\n Published statements are my authority\\n      for saying that excellent results have followed the administration of\\n      drugs, nevertheless; and in complete defiance of all therapeutic measures,\\n      a certain percentage of women remain barren; for with the more occult\\n      causes of sterility we remain, as yet, unacquainted, consequently they\\n      cannot all be reached with say kind of treatment whatever.\\n      \\n The following case I report somewhat in\\n      detail. Whilst not an exceptional case at all, it bears directly upon the\\n      subject under consideration, and possesses, it seems to me, some decidedly\\n      interesting features. My object in selecting this particular one is to\\n      call attention, if possible, to a condition not sufficiently considered.\\n      Mrs. J., aet. 26, married about two years and a half, appealed to my\\n      knowledge for a reason as to why she remained childless. The lady was\\n      carrying an excess of flesh, being under the medium height, and weighing\\n      186 pounds, but appeared to be in good health; family and previous history\\n      all that could be desired. Examination showed none of the common causes of\\n      sterility; neither, so far as I could ascertain, was the husband\\n      responsible for this unproductive condition of affairs. Some previous\\n      experiences of my own, with the added testimony of other and able men, was\\n      my reason for charging this condition of things to the excess of flesh,\\n      this, by the husband, being laughingly charged to excess of laziness.\\n      \\n We all, undoubtedly, are familiar with\\n      that peculiar disease of the blood-corpuscles which, whilst producing\\n      flesh, relaxes at the same time the muscular force; acting also, I\\n      believe, upon the muscular fibres of the uterus and upon the ovaries,\\n      inducing not only serious menstrual disorders but sterility. McKee,\\n      Philbert, and others give several instances of sterility chargeable to\\n      obesity, the women in question having been married several years without\\n      bearing children, and all became mothers after losing a portion of their\\n      flesh. If any other argument were needed in support of this theory we\\n      might turn to the quadrupeds, where we find the poorest breeders among the\\n      fleshiest animals. Fournel has a very able treatise on \"The Effects\\n      of Obesity on the Menstrual Functions and Parturition.\" Without\\n      having had any actual case of this description to deal with, he inclines\\n      very strongly towards the belief that obesity favors sterility. In the\\n      treatment of the case before mentioned, the patient was subjected to a\\n      daily massage of the entire body, with a special pelvic massage three\\n      times a week. This, in the main, consists in elevating the uterus as high\\n      as possible with the finger in the vagina, ending with a quick and decided\\n      vibratory motion. The diet received particular attention, as at this time\\n      there was a slight gastric ailment. The indicated remedy, Thuja, was given\\n      in the minimum dose. At the end of three months almost thirty pounds of\\n      flesh was gone, a considerable reduction. As an experiment, I recommended\\n      coitus in the knee-elbow position, advising that the lady remain quiet as\\n      long as possible after coition, with thighs well flexed. She became\\n      enciente, but miscarried at eight weeks. There was, comparatively\\n      speaking, but little pain and not much subsequent haemorrhage. She made a\\n      rapid recovery. Since then a living child has been born to them.\\n      \\n I believe I am safe in saying that this\\n      result would hardly have obtained were it not for the prophylactic\\n      measures adopted.\\n      \\n At the end of the first two months the\\n      patient was attacked with haemorrhage. A similar occurrence took place at\\n      irregular intervals during the following five months, the quantity of\\n      blood lost being much greater than that at the normal menstrual period.\\n      \\n For the greater part of the last five\\n      months she kept her bed, at the end of which time the tendency of the\\n      uterus to empty itself could be resisted no longer. A seven months\\' child\\n      was born, and is to-day doing well.\\n      \\n Pseudocyesis cerebral pregnancy,\\n      phantom pregnancy (whatever name we may call it by) is a disease which\\n      must come under the head of those \"complicating pregnancy.\" Mrs.\\n      M., a lady, married two or three years, aet. 29. Previous history good,\\n      always enjoying perfect health. When I first saw the lady in question she\\n      was a perfect picture of health, and, according to appearance and her own\\n      statements, about seven months pregnant. I made no examination. This\\n      appeared to be a thoroughly intelligent woman, and, according to her own\\n      statement, there was cessation of the menses. There certainly was an\\n      enlargement of the abdomen and breasts, a milky secretion, and the lady\\n      was sure that she felt foetal movement. On February 28th of the present\\n      year I was called to attend her in labor. Examination showed that no\\n      pregnancy existed. So far as I could ascertain there was no assignable\\n      origin for this condition other than nervous influences, the phenomena\\n      being purely muscular distension of the abdomen.\\n      \\n Mayham reports a case of a woman 73\\n      years old, claiming to be pregnant; he also claims that subsequently she\\n      was delivered of a child; this is an Allopathic report, however, of which\\n      we will take a Homoeopathic dose. Haultain reports three cases of cerebral\\n      pregnancy. In the first, he says no cause whatever was to be found; in the\\n      second, there was a small fibroid growth in the anterior uterine wall.\\n      Hauck reports a case where the vomiting, peristalsis, and flatus, caused\\n      by alcoholism were supposed to be caused by the pregnant state. Such cases\\n      are uncommon, but they emphasize the importance of making a thorough\\n      examination, in all cases where positive information is desired of the\\n      existence or non-existence of pregnancy.\\n      \\n Hyperemesis Gravidarum.-An animated\\n      discussion, held recently between two celebrated Allopaths of Stuttgart\\n      and Leipsic, has served to awaken a renewed interest in this subject,\\n      without in the least adding anything new to our stock of knowledge\\n      regarding its aetiology. Notwithstanding the frequency of the vomiting of\\n      pregnancy, its very distressing character in many instances, and its\\n      imminent, its very distressing character in many instances, and its\\n      imminent danger, we find but very few contributions of any value, to\\n      either the aetiology of the disorder or its therapeutics. I do not expect\\n      to add anything specially new myself, but it does seem to me that our\\n      knowledge of the vomiting of pregnancy, is to say the least, in a most\\n      contradictory state. Some physicians look upon it as a trifling matter,\\n      others as a thing to be endured, and some-these are in the right too-view\\n      even the mildest cases with gravity. Even in the mildest cases of morning\\n      sickness there is a constant drain upon the nervous system, putting the\\n      sufferer into a condition, in which she is very much less able to endure\\n      parturition than she would otherwise have been.\\n      \\n Dr. Harrison Mettler says: \"After\\n      careful inquiry I find that women who suffer from much morning sickness\\n      have as a rule, tedious or otherwise troublesome labors. I have observed\\n      in multiparae that at one time they will have much nausea and vomiting\\n      followed by a difficult labor, while at another time they will be quite\\n      free from the vomiting, and will pass through the succeeding labor with\\n      comparative ease.\" I must say my observations make me agree with Dr.\\n      Mettler entirely; when one thinks how rapidly the mildest of cases assume\\n      pernicious forms, indifference is certainly no longer to be excused. There\\n      is a voluminous literature upon this subject, and many and varied are the\\n      aetiological reasons given for this very variable affection, a large\\n      majority of writers coinciding in the opinion that \"many causes\\n      operate together,\" to produce what we are pleased to designate the\\n      \"vomiting of pregnancy.\" I believe myself that in a large\\n      percentage of cases, this pernicious vomiting is simply the result of a\\n      reflex neurosis. Undoubtedly uterine displacements frequently cause\\n      vomiting; but when this is so, and the displaced organ is raised by\\n      packing the vagina with aseptic wool, the vomiting ceases.\\n      \\n Lillie reports a number of cases, where\\n      obstinate vomiting was caused by a retroflexed uterus, and restoration of\\n      the organ caused a cessation of the disorder. Bezugloff having a\\n      persistent case of morning sickness, introduced a bougie it no the uterus,\\n      the intention being to produce abortion; the immediate result was a\\n      stoppage of the vomiting, and the pregnancy went on to full term.\\n      \\n In the case just cited, I must say that\\n      I believe it was the fright, caused by the thought of abortion being\\n      performed, more than the effects of introducing the bougie, which operated\\n      so successfully; I say now, as I said before, I believe that the\\n      pre-eminent cause of this kind of sickness must be looked for i the\\n      nervous system. Flint speaks of this form of sickness as being decidedly\\n      neurotic in its origin, and cites a number of cases of a chronic variety\\n      of dyspepsia frequently occurring in young girls. I had one such case come\\n      under my personal care. There was a persistent morning sickness, with this\\n      young lady, and a disagreeable nausea whenever food was taken; this\\n      patient was at some distance from her home, in a boarding school, and she\\n      will probably never know that the lady principal entertained very grave\\n      thoughts at one time in regard to her virtue. It certainly was very\\n      difficult to differentiate between this and the vomiting of pregnancy; it\\n      was, however, simply due to a vitiated nervous system. My theory is\\n      supported by Alt, who records a number of such cases; I cite one only, the\\n      case being that of a highly hysterical woman, six months pregnant,\\n      suffering from the gravest vomiting, and anxious that miscarriage be\\n      induced. She was making preparation for entering the hospital for this\\n      purpose, when one of her children was seized with pneumonia. The anxiety\\n      felt over the child, forced all thought of self from the mother\\'s mind;\\n      from that moment the vomiting ceased and she remained well until the\\n      termination of pregnancy.-Minchener Medicinische Wochenschrift.\\n      \\n Whilst saying that I believe this\\n      disease to be in the majority of cases of purely nervous origin, I would\\n      not imply thereby that it is not to be feared, far from it; if neglected,\\n      we know how likely it is to pass quickly beyond treatment and our patient\\n      succumb from sheer exhaustion.\\n      \\n In the treatment cited such as\\n      insertion of bougies, dilation of the os, pelvic massage, etc., I believe\\n      it is merely the \"doing something,\" no matter much what it is,\\n      so long as you have gained the confidence of your patient, that does good.\\n      We have seen how suddenly Hyperemesis will cease if the patient be\\n      alarmed; it may be, has often been, and will to again, cured by a process\\n      skin to suggestion. Kattenback had a case where the patient, a primipara,\\n      was seized with an incorrigible vomiting. It was suggested to her that her\\n      stomach contained some lumps of unwholesome material and their removal\\n      would cure her. Some milk was given her, and the stomach ceremoniously\\n      washed out. its contents bore no indications of either over-acidity or\\n      abnormal ferment She was informed that she was all right and the vomiting\\n      would not return; neither did if, and she was safely delivered at term.\\n      \\n There is a familiar and now well-know\\n      phenomena, by which these neurotics can be influenced; I speak of\\n      hypnotism; it is due to purely subjective conditions.\\n      \\n There is an identity of the hypnotic\\n      susceptibility with the condition of hysteria, and it is along these lines\\n      that we can work. Just as many times as I have tried this method of\\n      treatment, for these cases of excessive vomiting, just so many times has\\n      it given me gratifying results.\\n      \\n The patient can be to sleep by\\n      bi-ocular pressure, and the idea of cure suggested; the operation may have\\n      to be repeated several times, at intervals of a day or so, but you will be\\n      rewarded by the cessation of the vomiting, often with but one suggestion.\\n      Where the patient is not easily controlled by means of the bi-ocular\\n      pressure, Luy\\'s revolving mirror is a never failing resource.'\n",

It must recognize too, that\\n      the sick individual has to take an active part in his treatment and not be\\n      merely the passive recipient of this or that treatment. For just as it is\\n      rightly said that man does not live by alone, so should it be emphasized\\n      that man cannot be cured by medicine alone. He must see to it himself that\\n      he lives as far as possible a physically and psychically healthy life.\\n      Indeed, each individual has a power within himself to help in his own\\n      cure.\\n      \\n Do the official schools of medicine\\n      teach such an art today? I am afraid not: they are so intent on seeking\\n      the specific treatment for this or that named disease or the antibiotic\\n      that will most effectively put out of action the organism regarded as the\\n      cause of the disease, that they are losing sight of the individual\\n      himself.\\n      \\n But Homoeopathy in its persistent\\n      search for the reactions of the individual to his environment in the\\n      broadest sense, no matter of what the patient is complaining surely\\n      fulfills these requirements, especially when it is recognized that the\\n      homoeopathic potencies do not anything to the patient as do the drugs of\\n      the dominant school, but rather stimulate the patients own recuperative\\n      powers to overcome the infection or re - establish the normal metabolism\\n      which has become deranged by the illness.\\n      \\n When you consider how the homoeopathic\\n      physician diagnoses the individuality of his patient over and above the\\n      name of the disease from which he is suffering, and uses for the purpose\\n      of his prescription rather than the name of the disease this personal\\n      diagnosis of the patients mental and emotional reactions, his responses to\\n      changes in weather conditions, the alternations in his environment which\\n      influence his symptoms, etc., one realize how very individualistic is the\\n      Homoeopathic prescription fitted to that particular patient.\\n      \\n The homoeopathic physician does not\\n      seek for a remedy specific to any named disease and which he can thus\\n      apply almost automatically once he has made his organic diagnosis, which\\n      in quite an appreciable number of instances may ultimately be found to be\\n      wrong and so the treatment based upon it must therefore have been wrong.\\n      He does not, as is so often done, merely suppress the most outstanding\\n      symptom by an appropriate drug; for example giving an anodyne to mask the\\n      pain or removing the skin eruption by some strong local application, in\\n      other words putting the dust under the mat and pretending the room is\\n      clean.\\n      \\n Strangely enough the homoeopathic\\n      physician is often accused by his allopathic critic in his ignorance of\\n      Homoeopathy, of merely treating symptoms, whereas it is the critic himself\\n      who practices this superficial medicine. The homoeopathic physician, on\\n      the other hand, treats his patient as a whole through his symptoms and\\n      their modifications through changes in the environment, which is quite a\\n      different matter.\\n      \\n Homoeopathic therapy, unlike methods of\\n      treatment, is based on a natural law \"Similia Similibus\\n      Curentur\" \"Likes may be cured by likes\" which has been\\n      proved time and time again by experiment and which anyone with the will to\\n      do may prove for himself. It is not subject to constant change brought\\n      about by this or that latest discovery, and which itself will soon have to\\n      give way to the still later idea.\\n      \\n Having now introduced to you our actor,\\n      what of the scene in which he is to play his role?\\n      \\n This is the nineteen hundred and fifty\\n      - fourth year of the Christian era and the second year of the reign of our\\n      much loved and admired young Queen Elizabeth II, who will remember while\\n      in south Africa on her twenty - first birthday, before she had any idea\\n      that she would so soon be called to such an exalted position as she holds\\n      today, broadcast to the commonwealth and Empire her resolve to dedicate\\n      her life to the service of this grand community which dedication she\\n      recently repeated at her Coronation.\\n      \\n Here in Great Britain we have a more or\\n      less complete welfare state, with which idea some of us may very strongly\\n      disagree, whilst others believe such a development is the result of a\\n      natural very desirable social evolution.\\n      \\n As one necessary ingredient of this\\n      welfare state came, in 1948, the initiation of the National Health\\n      Service, through which the great majority of the population receives its\\n      medical attention, although it is rightly available to all.\\n      \\n When we come to consider the role that\\n      homoeo - therapeutics should play in this scheme, I would suggest that we\\n      should regard the problem from the purely medical aspect, forgetting any\\n      political party allegiances or sympathies we may have; or if we cannot\\n      forget them we should remember that the organization of the National\\n      Insurance Scheme of which the National Health Service is but a part, was\\n      first blue printed by the well - known Liberal supporter, Lord Beveridge,\\n      and the Health Service plans developed by the Coalition Government of all\\n      three major political parties.\\n      \\n We are living at present in an age\\n      which may very justifiably be regarded as a violent age in which have been\\n      developed so many appalling instruments of destruction, the use of some of\\n      which we are quite complacently accepting and from the use of others we\\n      are refraining, not because we consider them immoral, but simply through\\n      the fear of the wholesale destruction which would be caused by their use.\\n      We are seeing X-rays used in very high voltages in the treatment of\\n      cancer, we are being constantly remained of the use of dangerous drugs in\\n      medicine, without justification, in my opinion, bearing in mind the\\n      doubtful and evanescent ameliorations they produce and the violent\\n      surgical treatment of mental patients.\\n      \\n One further violence we should not\\n      forget is the way some of our foods are devitalized by the extraction of\\n      this or that portion of the natural product for purposes quite foreign to\\n      the well - being of the people who are to feed on them; or they are\\n      contaminated by the addition of this or that dangerous chemical, either\\n      during the growing of the plant, in the form of sprays, or as so called\\n      improvers in, for instance, the manufacture of white bread. It is very\\n      significant in this regard that quite a lot of attention is paid to the\\n      protection of the man who sprays the crops, but the right of the consumer\\n      to have uncontaminated food is slurred over by the unjustifiable statement\\n      that the amount of these chemicals so consumed is so small that it cannot\\n      have any bad effect on the consumer. We who practice Homoeopathy know how\\n      unwarranted is such a statement.\\n      \\n Can we homoeopathic physicians and\\n      patient hope to be able to do anything to make the still small voice of\\n      Homoeopathy heard in all this tumult, so that we may return to a saner and\\n      more healthful way of life and help our young Queen in her lifes work for\\n      the communitys sake?\\n      \\n Can we expect any help from the leaders\\n      of the medical profession? I am afraid not, because although I believe it\\n      accurate to state that there is a very slowly growing interest in, and\\n      tolerance of our work by individual doctors, the medical authorities are\\n      still, in their prejudice, strongly opposed to us. The London University\\n      still refuses to recognize our Hospital as a post - graduate teaching\\n      Hospital: the British Medical Association prohibits the formation of a\\n      homoeopathic section of its organization, and the Royal College of\\n      Physicians still refuses its membership to any one known as a homoeopathic\\n      physician. Yet in spite of this unfavourable environment, I firmly believe\\n      that there is a future for our method of therapeutics: but it will have to\\n      be pursued with courage, determination, foresight and energy. Surely if we\\n      believe as I do, that we are the guardians of a system of treatment\\n      destined to make our people healthier and therefore more efficient and\\n      happier, we would be failing in our duty to our country if we did not take\\n      every means in our power to acquaint the community at large with the\\n      advantages of this system and the dangers of ignoring it. This is a duty,\\n      not only of the profession, but also of the laity interested in\\n      Homoeopathy and who have experienced its benefits.\\n      \\n Every physician has two professional\\n      obligation to the community, that of preserving its health and that of\\n      endeavouring to restore it to being when it has fallen by the way.\\n      \\n The homoeopathic physician, thorough\\n      his knowledge acquired through the provings of drugs, even in\\n      infinitesimal doses, has, I believe, a very special responsibility as\\n      regards the prophylaxis of disease. It seems to me that a great deal of\\n      chronic ill health may quite conceivably be due to the manipulations of\\n      our foods and to the artificial manuring of the ground in which many of\\n      them are grown. Experiments have been carried our proving that plants\\n      grown in soil enriched by natural manuring, are much less prone to\\n      diseases than those grown with the help of artificial chemical manures. It\\n      seems a fairly justified conclusion that vegetables grown under these\\n      artificial conditions may quite well be deficient in something necessary\\n      for our perfect health. It is therefore incumbent upon the physician to\\n      advocate whenever possible the ingestion of healthily grown foods in the\\n      widest sense of that term.\\n      \\n The same duty applies when we consider\\n      the great amount of drugging in which the community at large indulges by\\n      its excessive smoking, particularly when aggravated by the practice of\\n      inhaling, and by the continued and prolonged use of drugs for this or that\\n      symptom, too often, unfortunately, though not always, on the prescription\\n      of their medical advisors.\\n      \\n There is a great lack throughout the\\n      community of any real enthusiasm for perfect health: we are only too prone\\n      to be content to follow like sheep, the unintelligent and harmful\\n      practices of the majority of our fellows.\\n      \\n Similarly in the curative realm, we\\n      homoeopathic physicians have special obligations.\\n      \\n When considering our position vis-a-vis\\n      the rest of the profession, we must never lose sight of the fact that our\\n      approach to the sick individual is a much broader and more comprehensive\\n      one than that of the dominant school. This latter prides itself on its\\n      scientific approach to its problems. One must, however, always be on ones\\n      guard against being hypnotized by that word scientific. The scientific\\n      aspect of any phenomenon or problem dealing with humanity is only one\\n      limited aspect of that problem. To get a complete picture one must\\n      consider other aspect, such as the aesthetic, emotional, maybe religious,\\n      and above all, perhaps one might say embracing all, the philosophical\\n      approach. This complex approach to his patients problem is the one that\\n      the homoeopathic physician always strives to adopt, and so never loses\\n      sight of the ego of the patient, while at the same time not forgetting his\\n      physical make - up.\\n      \\n Because this approach of ours to our\\n      patients is a much broader and more comprehensive one than the much\\n      vaunted scientific aspect, which the dominant school has come to regard as\\n      the Ultima Thule of medicine, I deplore the oft - repeated request of some\\n      of my colleagues that we should forsake our philosophy and make our work\\n      as scientific as theirs. I do not mean to imply by this that we should\\n      neglect the scientific angle of our patients illness but we should always\\n      remember that is only one facet of our problem. That is why we take such\\n      pains to diagnose our patients personality with his reaction to his\\n      environment in addition to the physical diagnosis of the case in order to\\n      arrive at our prescription for his malady. In other words, we should\\n      endeavour to lead our dominant school colleagues to our way of thinking,\\n      rather than that we should adopt theirs.\\n      \\n At the same time must always remember\\n      that if our philosophy should seem at any time to contradict so - called\\n      scientific laws, we must re - examine our philosophy, and if necessary\\n      modify it, while at the same time remembering that many times in the past\\n      what have been regarded as laws have ultimately been proved not to be so.\\n      Thus it is evident that we must never relax our self - examination.\\n      \\n What shall be the role of the\\n      homoeopathic laity?\\n      \\n The first thing for them to remember is\\n      that we are living in a democratic country whose government is dependent\\n      on the goodwill of the governed, and that, if a sufficient number of\\n      voters desire a certain line of action, that line will be adopted by the\\n      government.\\n      \\n The second thought is that there are\\n      not nearly sufficient doctors practising Homoeopathy in Great Britain to\\n      satisfy the present demand, let alone any further increased demand in the\\n      future, for this line of treatment.\\n      \\n Does not this seem strange, having\\n      regard to the great advantage to humanity that Homoeopathy provides? Not\\n      if one looks below the surface and so finds the reason for this shortage.\\n      \\n Surely the most potent reason is that\\n      Homoeopathy is not taught in the official Medical Schools, either as a pre\\n      - or post - graduate study. The London University when asked to recognize\\n      the Royal London Homoeopathic Hospital as a post - graduate Medical\\n      School, refused on the plea that as Homoeopathy was not taught in the\\n      undergraduate Medical Schools, it could not find a place for it in its\\n      post - graduate curriculum.\\n      \\n It is, of course, nonsense to suggest\\n      that a graduate should pursue his studies only in those subject of which\\n      he had already obtained some knowledge in his undergraduate days and\\n      should not wish to obtain information on any new or extra subject.\\n      \\n The University Medical Shools are\\n      enabled to a great extent through Government grants. We must therefore\\n      find some way of influencing whatever Government be in power to bring\\n      pressure to bear upon the London University to remove this obstacle to the\\n      better health of the community at large. I am quite satisfied that once\\n      this academic recognition is obtained we shave many more post - graduate\\n      students of Homoeopathy.\\n      \\n I believe than in a democratic\\n      community, having a universal State Medical Service, it is the bounden\\n      duty of the Government to remove all obstacles to the peoples obtaining\\n      that form of medical treatment in which they have confidence. So long as\\n      Homoeopathy is denied its legitimate status, so long must be Government be\\n      deemed to b failing in its duty to the country.\\n      \\n If, however, we are to achieve this\\n      desirable object of full recognition, we must all, professional and laity,\\n      be fired with enthusiasm, not only for the abstract cause of Homoeopathy,\\n      but for being partners with our young Queen in delicating our lives to the\\n      community.\\n      \\n When we do this we shall help to make\\n      this second Elizabethan era one to be remembered throughout the ages to\\n      come as surpassing the first Elizabethan era in that it gained not so much\\n      the economic and political leadership of the world - though that is not to\\n      be despised - but showed the way to the most healthful and spiritual way\\n      of life that all the world look notice and followed suit.\\n      \\n To sum up, the Role of Homoeopathy, as\\n      I see it, is to humanize the practice of medicine. By that I mean it must\\n      bring the practice of medicine into line with a reasoned philosophy of\\n      life, restore to it its artistry and rid it of all unnecessary hazards. It\\n      is to do this, not from any abstract academic sense of superiority, but in\\n      order the years to come are not those of merely another reign, but to\\n      ensure a veritable Renaissance, starting with the second Elizabethan era\\n      in which Great Britain will take its rightful place in the comity of\\n      nations as the pathfinder to a way of life for which posterity will be\\n      able to say \"Thank God for Queen Elizabeth the Second and her\\n      peoples.'\n",
      " 'Tresorie - Roentgenometric Pelvimetry [Roentgenometric Pelvimetry]\\n CHARLES W.PERKINS, M.D.\\n      \\n Norwalk, Conn\\n      \\n FOR some time the x-ray has been used\\n      to advantage in diagnosis of multiple pregnancy, position of fetus and\\n      fetal abnormalities. However, it has been only the past four or five years\\n      that any definite information has been obtained by roentgenographic\\n      methods of diagnoses in pelvimetry.\\n      \\n At the present time we are convinced\\n      that only by means of roentgenographs can be true proportions of the\\n      superior strait be determined, and that the ordinary external methods of\\n      Pelvimetry are not only occasionally misleading but proportionately\\n      inaccurate.\\n      \\n The present communication deals with\\n      the method of Herbert Thomas of Yale University. This method was developed\\n      in cooperation with the late Dr. W.A. Lafield, who was Professor of\\n      Roentgenology at the Yale Medical School.\\n      \\n Some of the reasons why roentgen\\n      pelvimetry has not been more universally adopted are probably due to the\\n      following factors.\\n      \\n (1) The majority of women will be\\n      delivered normally, whether or not pelvic measurements are made.\\n      \\n (2) The medical profession does not\\n      readily accept a new method after an established satisfactory routine has\\n      been in use.\\n      \\n (3) A new method of diagnosis incurs\\n      added expense.\\n      \\n (4) The present methods, although\\n      entirely speculative, are satisfactory in most cases.\\n      \\n (5) Roentgen pelvimetry cannot be\\n      performed by the obstetrician himself but requires the aid of a\\n      roentgenologist.\\n      \\n (6) The value of roentgenometric\\n      diagnosis is recent in origin and as yet not universally accepted.\\n      \\n If the knowledge of the size and shape\\n      of the pelvis is necessary to the practice of obstetrics, roentgen\\n      pelvimetry is a sound procedure, particularly in pre-emptors patients, and\\n      should and should be considered as an indispensable aid in these cases.\\n      \\n The method of Herbert Thoms as\\n      developed at Yale Medical School is not the only method. However, it can\\n      be classified as simple, accurate and rapid; being adaptable for use by\\n      other than experts in x-ray and obstetric diagnosis. As a technical\\n      procedure a well trained hospital technician can master its technic alter\\n      sufficient instruction.\\n      \\n Studies of recent years reveal the fact\\n      that external Pelvimetry fails to give uniform and accurate information in\\n      regard to the shape and size of the superior strait. This is often true of\\n      thin undersized individuals. In many patients of this type external\\n      measurements may suggest a contracted pelvis while the x-ray will show a\\n      relatively large pelvis with a subsequent natural labor and normal-sized\\n      child. On the other hand a stocky short person with similar external\\n      measurements will disclose a contracted pelvis which is an obstetric\\n      problem. Because of the apparent relationship between shortening of the\\n      transverse diameter and a secondary persistent occipito-posterior\\n      presentation, accurate information regarding this diameter is of clinical\\n      significance.\\n      \\n The observations of Thomas were made on\\n      twenty consecutive patients whose pelvis showed a relative or real\\n      shortening of the transverse diameter of the superior strait. In every\\n      instance a primary or secondary occipito posterior position was found\\n      after the patient was in labor. (Herbert Thoms, Surgery, Gynecology and\\n      Obstetrics, January, 1933). It therefore has been proved that an actual or\\n      relative shortening of a transverse diameter of the superior strait\\n      results in a limitation of space that is greater in the anterior than in\\n      the posterior half of the superior strait. Under these circumstances, when\\n      the head descends early in labor, the occiput is forced to rotate\\n      posteriorly.\\n      \\n The x-ray offers additional information\\n      in determining the size of the fetal head. It has been noted in x-ray\\n      examination of the unengaged fetal head that it lay with the transverse\\n      diameter of the superior strait, the occiput being either to the right or\\n      left; therefore, if roentgenogram of the patient is taken in the supine\\n      position with the fetus in the uterus, it will cast a shadow which is an\\n      enlarged profile of the head. The measurements of the occipital frontal\\n      diameter of the head can then be made. On numerous occasions this method\\n      of cephalometry, determining the diameter of the unmoulded head before and\\n      after cesarean section, has yielded accurate results. (Thomas, A.M.A.,\\n      February 24, 1934).\\n      \\n As experience increases in roentgen\\n      pelvimetry, the so-called labor test will be employed less. This, however,\\n      does not mean that the physician should not under estimate the importance\\n      of uterine contraction and the ability of the fetal head to mold. It has\\n      always followed that when something could be proved desirable in medicine\\n      for the better protection of the patient, such an advance would be\\n      demanded and eventually become routine. We may concede, therefore, that\\n      roentgen pelvimetry has a distinct place in the examination of every\\n      primiparous woman. In many instances, according to Thomas and others,\\n      external; measurements were normal but the x-ray examination revealed a\\n      contracted pelvis. On the other had, in certain patients whose external\\n      measurements suggested a cesarean section roentgen pelvimetry proved\\n      otherwise and they were subsequently delivered in a normal manner.\\n      \\n CENTIMETER GRID METHOD.\\n      \\n The procedure in this method may be\\n      summarized by stating the following:.\\n      \\n (1) The patient is placed on the\\n      roentgenographic table in the semi- recumbent position.\\n      \\n (2) The level of the superior strait\\n      above the sensitized film is established.\\n      \\n (3) The tube target is centered about\\n      five centimeters posterior to the symphysis, at thirty-two inches from the\\n      sensitized film, The exposure is made.\\n      \\n (4) The patient is removed from the\\n      table, the tube target and sensitized film remaining in situ.\\n      \\n (5) A lead plate, or centimeter grid,\\n      with perforations exactly one centimeter apart, is introduced into the\\n      same plane as that previously occupied by the superior strait and a second\\n      (flash) exposure is made on the same sensitized film as was used used in\\n      the previous exposure.\\n      \\n (6) Development of the film shows the\\n      outline of the superior strait and the shadows of the perforations, the\\n      assistance between which represents centimeters in the plane of the\\n      superior strait. The anteroposterior and transverse diameters of the\\n      superior strait in its use proportions may be drawn on centimeter-square\\n      paper by following the course of the shadow of the superior strait and\\n      transcribing it.\\n      \\n As this time I wish to express my\\n      thanks to Dr. Thoms for his personal advice and instruction which helped\\n      me to master the technic of his method.'\n",
      " 'Tresorie - NOTATU DIGNUM [Test Of A Homoeopath]\\n\\n Complaints are not unfrequently made\\n      that the homoeopathic materia medica is too vast for practical utility;\\n      that the schematised list of symptoms are unprofitable, if not impossible\\n      reading.

Indeed, I think that the test of a genuine\\n      homoeopath might not unfairly be said to life in his capacity to read\\n      through a Schema with both profit and enjoyment because of the\\n      possibilities it reveals of dealing with cases occurring every day in\\n      practice.

      " 'Tresorie - THE EFFICACY OF THE VIBROMETER IN APPLYING VIBRATORY MASSAGE\\nIN AURAL DISEASES [Efficacy Of Vibrometer In Applying Vibratory Message In Aural\\nDisease]\\n\\n SINCE presenting my paper before the\\n      American Institute, in June of last year on \"Vibratory Motion as a\\n      Method of Massage in Aural Diseases,\" I have been using an instrument\\n      specially devised for that purpose called the \"vibrometer.\" This\\n      instrument is in shape like a banjo, and has four strings stretched across\\n      its length resting on a bridge, which sets upon a diaphragm. On each side,\\n      elevated above the diaphragm and supported by posts, are two horizontal\\n      bars, which support the mechanical appliances used for producing the\\n      various vibratory motions. This consists in what is called a yoke, in\\n      which revolves a shaft connected with the electro-motor by pulley-wheels\\n      and a belt. Behind the diaphragm is a shallow air-tight compartment,\\n      leading from which are rubber tubes that are inserted in the external\\n      auditory canal during treatment, consequently any vibratory motion of the\\n      diaphragm, which must necessarily be an inward and a corresponding outward\\n      movement, would be exactly reproduced upon the membrana tympani, as the\\n      confined air, not being able to escape, will undergo an alternate\\n      condensation and rarefication in the external auditory canal.\\n      \\n Every vibratory movement of the strings\\n      of the instrument is communicated to the diaphragm by means of the bridge\\n      upon which it rests. These strings by varying their tension and length can\\n      be regulated to give a high or low rate of vibration as desired, for\\n      instance, the heaviest string left at its original length adjusted to a\\n      slight tension may make about fifty vibratory motions to the second, while\\n      the highest string on the instrument adjusted to a high tension and\\n      clamped down to one-fourth its original length would probably make three\\n      thousand vibratory motions to the second.\\n      \\n In the centre of the diaphragm is an\\n      attachment which works on a lever, and when hit by the cam on the\\n      revolving shaft lifts the diaphragm to a considerable extent, causing a\\n      powerful effect on the membrana tympani. This attachment can be adjusted\\n      at four different leverages, which causes a modification or increase of\\n      its intensity and can be regulated at from one to twenty-five vibratory\\n      movements to the second. This is only used in very bad cases and for not\\n      more than five minutes continuously.\\n      \\n The instrument which I have been\\n      describing in an improvement on the first manufactured, and as far as I\\n      know, is the only one which offers the same facilities for applying this\\n      method of massage. The class of patients in my experience who are\\n      generally benefited from the first, are those in which the mucous membrane\\n      lining the tympanic cavity and Eustachian tubes is in a hypertrophic\\n      condition. The membrana tympani are depressed, opaque, and thickened. They\\n      usually complain of a stiffed sensation in the ears, with a great deal of\\n      tinnitus aurium, and that their hearing is worse during a cold. In cases\\n      where the mucous membranes are atrophied with a large external auditory\\n      canal perfectly dry and Eustachian tubes patulous, and generally very\\n      little tinnitus, this or no other treatment has done very much good in the\\n      majority of cases, and in looking ever my records I find that only about\\n      five per cent. have been relieved, while in the before-mentioned cases the\\n      good results reach at least seventy-five per cent. In treating persons, I\\n      always select the rate of vibration which corresponds in pitch, if\\n      possible, to that caused by the diseased condition of the ears. If there\\n      is no tinnitus to guide me, I find whether the patient can hear a high or\\n      low sound better; if it is a low sound, a high rate of vibration is used\\n      in treatment, and vice versa, A point which I would like to explain here\\n      is this: It is not necessary that the sound from the instrument should be\\n      of the same quality of the tinnitus experienced by the patient, but merely\\n      the same pitch. for instance, if a banjo, where one of the strings was\\n      adjusted when sounded to produce a certain note, and a musical instrument\\n      of any other kind, whose quality of tone was entirely different, was made\\n      to sound the same note in a room, the string on the banjo would vibrate in\\n      sympathy, which has been proven by experiment, any other note, no matter\\n      how loud, would have no effect. Another point is in the way the strings of\\n      the vibrometer are set in motion. On the revolving shaft is a wheel\\n      projecting from which are metallic picks which hit the string it is\\n      adjusted over. It does not make any difference in the number of vibratory\\n      motions per second, whether the string is hit fast or slow, but at the\\n      time the string is first hit the intensity is greater than it is just\\n      before being hit again, and as the motion of the wheel is perfectly\\n      rhythmic, revolving so many times to the second, it has just as good an\\n      effect as if the intensity during the fraction of a second did not vary at\\n      all. The idea of using vibratory motion, as I have said before, originated\\n      within my mind some years ago, and later put into practical operation, and\\n      as far as I know, was the first to lay before the profession in a\\n      scientific manner, this method of massage.\\n      \\n I have found that when two of the\\n      strings upon the vibrometer were regulated in such a way that when both\\n      were set in vibration at the same time, producing the sensation of a\\n      harmonious sound, the effect in some cases on the tinnitus was especially\\n      beneficial, relieving, where the various kinds of vibrations produced by a\\n      single string failed. Sub-acute cases of deafness, accompanied by tinnitus\\n      aurium, are quickly relieved, as the following case will illustrate:.\\n      \\n Mrs. M. Young, married lady, aet. 26,\\n      called at my office, April 1, 1893, complaining of partial deafness and\\n      tinnitus aurium. She had a stuffed sensation, or as if cotton had been\\n      packed in the external auditory canal. She says the tinnitus was so\\n      annoying as to prevent sleep. On examination, found considerable\\n      retraction of the membrana tympani, and hearing for the watch, on the\\n      right side five inches, on the left, seven inches. The Eustachian tube\\n      were partially closed, which made inflation somewhat difficult, giving\\n      slight relief. I used several of the vibrations on the different strings\\n      without immediate benefit.\\n      \\n April 4th.-She came again, and reported\\n      that no improvement had taken place. I again inflated her ears, after\\n      which she sat down to the vibrometer. The central attachment was used with\\n      considerable force continuously for four minutes, after which she declared\\n      that the tinnitus had entirely ceased in the right ear, and greatly\\n      modified in the left; the hearing for the watch had increased for both\\n      ears to fourteen inches, and the stuffed sensation had almost entirely\\n      disappeared. On inspection of the membrana tympani, found them\\n      comparatively very slightly retracted. On April 8th, found improvement had\\n      continued, when the same treatment was used for three minutes; after which\\n      she declared herself completely relieved of the tinnitus and stuffed\\n      sensation, with hearing powerfully restored. Saw her again on April 13th,\\n      when she declared the good results from last treatment to have still\\n      continued.\\n      \\n I find that in the majority of cases,\\n      when the strings of the instrument are used it is only necessary to strike\\n      them lightly with the friction wheel. In vibrating the heavy string, I\\n      generally set the bridge back behind the central attachment, and adjusting\\n      the motor in such way that the belt is at a considerable tension, so that\\n      the pulley-wheel revolves slowly. I also generally use this adjustment\\n      when setting in motion two strings at one time. The principle of this\\n      method of treatment embraces two essential features which to my mind makes\\n      this system of massage the only scientific one applicable to the membrana\\n      tympani and its associate sound-conducting parts. Message is the\\n      application of motion to disease, and its scientific administration\\n      consists of its application in a systematic manner. In applying massage in\\n      aural diseases, it is necessary to produce a to-and-fro movement of the\\n      membrana tympani, and, if possible, by a force which is harmless and at\\n      the same time effective. The vibrometer fulfils these conditions. Any of\\n      the strings on the instrument that may be set in motion by the\\n      friction-wheel, will produce a certain number of vibratory movements to\\n      the second of time, and the movements of the central attachment are also\\n      measured. What could be more systematic than this? The motions of the\\n      membrana tympani were intended by nature to its vibratory, and as the\\n      vibrometer generates measured motion, and these motions are vibratory,\\n      theoretically we have a scientific and effective method of massage in\\n      aural diseases; and, as demonstrated practically by the use of the\\n      vibrometer, we have in fact a great scientific advance over all previous\\n      methods. Since the introduction of this treatment in aural diseases, it\\n      makes possible a more or less benefit in cases of deafness heretofore\\n      considered hopeless, and has opened up the field for the treatment of\\n      aural diseases to such an extent that the number of deaf patients seeking\\n      relief at the aurist\\'s hands will at least double itself.\\n      \\n DISCUSSION.\\n      \\n H.C. HOUGHTON, M.D.: Dr. Garey\\'s\\n      admirable paper gives us the description of the vibrometer, an instrument\\n      devised under his personal direction and inspection, for the purpose of\\n      applying massage to the ear. It is the only instrument of the kind on the\\n      market, so far as I am aware, and after a somewhat prolonged use of it, I\\n      am prepared to recommend the latest production of the vibrometer company.\\n      \\n This instrument is a decided\\n      improvement over the instrument first sent out, and is capable of\\n      producing a most profound effect upon the drum-head and ossicula; indeed,\\n      upon the entire auditory apparatus. I am able to confirm Dr. Garey\\'s\\n      statement of the effect of high and low vibrations us regards treatment.\\n      \\n I have also been very much interested\\n      in the use of stringed or reed instruments for diagnosis, and find that we\\n      can detect any abnormal sensitiveness of the auditory nerve to high or low\\n      tones. Some patients are extremely sensitive to all tones, high or low;\\n      others to high tones and not to low tones; others, conversely. Again, in\\n      some instances, there is a peculiar sensitiveness to single tones or to\\n      discords produced by sounding the note and half-note at the same time.\\n      Under the action of the central attachment of the vibrometer this\\n      sensitiveness is modified, the sensitiveness to high tones disappearing\\n      and being replaced by a low tone or, conversely, under treatment, a low\\n      tone disappears and a high tone is established, temporarily, at least.\\n      Again, in cases of recent origin, treatment will substitute an undefined\\n      rushing sound for a definite musical tone, either high or low, and later,\\n      the treatment will abolish this, the patient being relieved of this\\n      intensely annoying symptom. In some cases, with this relief, there is an\\n      improvement in the audition; in other cases, no improvement follows.\\n      \\n I confess to the domination of the\\n      material over my mind in my earlier experience with massage, and I think\\n      the inclination of operators will be to use a far greater degree of power\\n      than is necessary. I therefore notice with great satisfaction Professor\\n      Garey\\'s remark that \"the object should be to produce a to-and-fro\\n      motion to the membrana tympani, and, if possible, by a force which is\\n      harmless and at the same time effective.\" I would hardly say\\n      \"to-and-fro motion of the drum-head,\" because I think that the\\n      expression is liable to perpetuate the motion which is fixed in the minds\\n      of most physiologists, that the drum-head moves as a whole, with a\\n      to-and-fro motion.\" That is true under the influence of the Politzer,\\n      Siegle\\'s otoscope and similar instruments; but it certainly does not so\\n      move in the ordinary function of audition, but stands as the iris does in\\n      the eye, as an adjustor, a regulator of sound-force; in some sense as the\\n      iris does in its relation with the lens, to adjust, regulate and direct\\n      the essential force, and the vibration of the drum-head is at every node;\\n      every portion receives impressions that are converted into molecular\\n      disturbances of varying lengths, according as they are produced upon the\\n      stiff and unyielding portions of the drum-head at the periphery, along the\\n      manubrium, or in the more attenuated and easily-yielding portions which\\n      the between these two areas. Not only so, but these impulses are\\n      communicated to the contained air of the tympanum, and make their\\n      impression upon the acoustic nerve through the round window synchronously\\n      with the impression made through the ossicula.\\n      \\n This whole subject widens before my\\n      mind in such a way that one might wish himself twenty years and at liberty\\n      to devote himself to a term of research in acoustics, such as is offered\\n      only in the technical schools of the continent of Europe.\\n      \\n WM. R. KING, M.D.: In discussing Dr.\\n      Garey\\'s paper I shall begin by saying that his methods have been closely\\n      followed by me since the beginning of his experiments, owing to the fact\\n      that I have been greatly interested in the treatment of deafness and\\n      tinnitus by means of sound waves or by aural massage since 1887, and have\\n      experimented and treated many cases by this method since then, though with\\n      crude and unsatisfactory instruments. Since using the vibrometer-which,\\n      after much study and experimentation, is now presented to the profession\\n      in practical shape-I have undoubtedly increased my percentage of good\\n      results.\\n      \\n I don\\'t believe I am over-sanguine or\\n      carried away by interest in this method, and believe I can rightly\\n      appreciate that this does not offer us a panacea or cure-all for auditory\\n      ailments, and hope I may always be ready to see the failures and to strive\\n      to find methods or remedies to reach some of them.\\n      \\n In speaking of the application of the\\n      instrument, I wish to call attention to the central attachment or post foe\\n      vibrations. Dr. Garey has not given it as much attention in the paper as\\n      it deserves. It is very useful as a general means of aural massage,\\n      rougher in nature and more general in application than the strings which\\n      help to make up the instrument. I often use it before applying the\\n      \"similar found\" to a given case, as a species of gymnastics, to\\n      stimulate secretion and motion in the conducting apparatus of the ear,\\n      viz., membrana tympani and ossicles. In most cases-in fact, in all-where\\n      tinnitus is present, I follow this up immediately by the nearest approach\\n      to the similar pitch obtainable.\\n      \\n I agree thoroughly with Dr. Garey, that\\n      the best results are achieved in cases accompanying hypertrophic catarrh,\\n      and that the least benefit is apparent in cases of atrophic nature.\\n      \\n Regarding the method of treatment in\\n      the absence of tinnitus, my experience the does not coincide with that of\\n      the author of the paper entirely; I do not feel that as yet we have any\\n      safe rule to guide us. My method has been to try the numerous sounds and\\n      variations the of until I find the one that seems to give the best\\n      immediate results, or that the patient himself will speak of as very\\n      penetrating and powerful )though not necessarily loud and heavy).\\n      \\n It seems almost impossible at present\\n      to simulate all the qualities of tone as they occur in the ears of those\\n      suffering with tinnitus; in fact, it would appear to be unnecessary.\\n      However, it seems advantageous and quite necessary to secure the closest\\n      simulation of pitch, thus in many cases soon obliterating annoying\\n      tinnitus and improving hearing powers.\\n      \\n The arrangement permitting of the\\n      picking of two strings simultaneously adds decidedly the usefulness of the\\n      instrument, as it increases the range of pitch as well as varying the\\n      quality of tones procurable, thereby decidedly enlarging our field of\\n      application.\\n      \\n The force used for creating the message\\n      or gymnastics of the membrana tympani and the ossicles-viz, vibratory\\n      force or sound- carefully and scientifically applied, is nature\\'s remedy,\\n      because it is adapted by nature, and is the only force which can rightly\\n      or safely be applied to these delicate portions of this complex organ of\\n      hearing.\\n      \\n A startling commentary on this subject\\n      is the array of cases benefited who have been relegated to the shelf by\\n      ancient and modern otology; cases declared unhelpable have been vastly\\n      improved. Pray, make no mistake; I did not say all cases.\\n      \\n It may be interesting to hear the\\n      latest regarding the instrument which was first invented for the\\n      application of this method of aural massage Mr. E.J. Godman, the inventor\\n      and patentee, is constantly on the lookout, and always striving for\\n      improvements to his machine. He has made many that you all know of. Permit\\n      me to report a few so recent they have not yet left the factory.\\n      \\n First.-The machine has been taken from\\n      its case, and is now mounted on a solid stand or table of oak, being set\\n      below the level, or so that the face of the instrument is just level with\\n      the face of the table. This is all supported by rigid, solid metal legs,\\n      which absolutely prevent foreign vibrations.\\n      \\n Second.-The motor has been removed from\\n      its little shelf and relegated below the table. I t can be placed upon a\\n      box on the floor, a shelf against the wall, or, better yet, a shelf\\n      solidly attached to the metal supports of the table. A belt goes up\\n      through an aperture to a wheel on a shaft, the other extremity of which\\n      carries a wheel with a rubber tire (a friction wheel), which in its\\n      revolution, being in contact with a larger flat- surfaced wheel on the\\n      main shaft of the instrument, turns this in harmony with itself. This\\n      arrangement does away with the necessity of shifting the motor each time\\n      you wish to shift the carriage from one string to another- a consummation\\n      to be devoutly thankful for. The removal of the motor from the instrument\\n      as at present attached will recommend itself to all who have used the\\n      vibrometer, a great amount of undesirable jar being thus avoided.\\n      \\n Third.-Ratchet keys capable of very\\n      fine adjustment of tension of strings are now provided for the instrument.\\n      \\n Fourth.-A rheostadt or resistance-coil\\n      is now to be placed beneath the table between the storage battery and the\\n      switch, by this means enabling us to control the speed and number of\\n      revolutions to a nicety.\\n      \\n Other, though comparatively minor,\\n      improvements are being made, and others are contemplated, as, for\\n      instance, the substitution of a roughly corrugated rubber band for the\\n      picker on the wheel, thereby getting rid of the metallic sound of the\\n      picker on the wire strings.\\n      \\n I have experimented with a number of\\n      appliance for the production of the sounds and pitches that I have\\n      required, but I always fall back on the vibrometer, especially as at\\n      present constructed, for satisfactory work and results.\\n      \\n This instrument may be, and probably\\n      is, as yet, in its infancy. It, and the method it applies, can only be\\n      perfected by constant work and experimentation both on the part of the\\n      profession and of the manufacturers. Each improvement we can suggest, if\\n      it only should serve as a means of helping one solitary case, would be\\n      well worth our while.\\n      \\n The experiments being made by different\\n      methods for treating deafness by sound waves is indicative of the interest\\n      the profession has taken in the matter. It is indicative of a lack of\\n      something in our usual armamentarium which is greatly longed for by\\n      patient and doctor; that is, the means for making the deaf hear and for\\n      relieving distressing tinnitus. There has been a dearth in this direction,\\n      and perhaps there still is, but I believe fully that we have in aural\\n      massage by vibratory force a decided acquisition at our hands.\\n      \\n E. H. LINNELL., M.D.: I would simply\\n      like to ask Dr. King how long he uses the instrument, and whether he uses\\n      it according to the deafness.\\n      \\n DR. KING: Yes, decidedly. In an intense\\n      case of deafness I would have to use it a great deal longer. The central\\n      attachment I never carry over three or five minutes, and the whole\\n      treatment I don\\'t think is over carried over twenty or twenty-five minutes\\n      in one case, and usually averages from ten to fifteen.\\n      \\n HAROLD WILSON, M.D.: I have only to\\n      suggest, what I have elsewhere called attention to, the possibility of\\n      another mechanical device for securing vibratory motion. It is well known\\n      that in the make and break of a current of electricity, in the circuit of\\n      which there is a telephone, we get an influence upon the make and break of\\n      the current in the telephone. Now, it is a simple matter with which these\\n      makes and breaks are made as to obtaining any number of vibration that you\\n      wish. You may, by a mechanical device of some rotary motion, if you\\n      choose, make and break the current as rapidly as you please until you have\\n      reached several thousand vibrations a second, or you may even make the\\n      vibrations so slow us to be easily counted. The application of this\\n      suggestion has been put in force in my own practice, more or less, in the\\n      use of the telephone as connected with the induction-coil ordinary\\n      battery. The more intense the current, the more intense the sound. You can\\n      easily see that it is mere question of mechanics to secure these two\\n      sounds-intensity of vibration and rapidity of vibration. I will say,\\n      furthermore, that it has this advantage. There is no noise in the office,\\n      which I think is not altogether true of the vibrometer. I would suggest\\n      that so far as the vibrometer is concerned, if it could be made to be\\n      noiseless to anybody but the patient, it would be a decided improvement.\\n      In that respect the telephone is a decided improvement, because there is\\n      no noise except to the patient, because the noise is right at the ear of\\n      the patient. If I were seeking for a perfected instrument in this line, I\\n      would go outside of the banjo idea. As we have the most perfect writing\\n      machines, which have no connection with the ordinary method of writing,\\n      and sewing machines, which have no connection with sewing by hand, so it\\n      occurs to me that possibly the securing of he vibratory motion upon the\\n      ears might be obtained in a totally different way from that which you get\\n      when you listen to the drum of the guitar or an ordinary musical\\n      instrument, and I would suggest that the make and break of a telephone\\n      open a very fruitful field for mechanical experimentation.\\n      \\n H.C. HOUGHTON, M.D.: In my study of\\n      this subject I made the acquaintance of Mr. Bernhardt, of New York City,\\n      who is a personal friend of Mr. Emil Berliner, the inventor of the Emil\\n      Berliner Telephone, which is the instrument by which the Bell Telephone\\n      Company maintain their monopoly at present. Mr. Berliner is the inventor\\n      of the graphophone, and has, I think, covered this whole matter which Dr.\\n      Wilson has mentioned. As ordinary Bell telephone receiver is put into the\\n      circuit of an ordinary induction machine, and you can use it just as the\\n      English people use the audiometer, and as you remove the coil you modify\\n      the vibrations, which is covered with another disk and a tube, and that\\n      tube covered with a stethoscope tube, which is the same as we use for the\\n      phonograph or vibrometer, and, as Dr. Wilson has suggested, you can modify\\n      the intensity, and of course the whole matter is adjusted by the\\n      attachment of the cord, so that you can have fine vibrations. The\\n      intensity of the vibrations is regulated by the distance to which you\\n      uncover the cord. The only difficulty in the adjustment is that it has\\n      been so severe that it is really uncomfortable, and the noise of the\\n      instrument is reduced to the minimum for office use.\\n      \\n A.B. NORTON, M.D.: I will also add that\\n      in regard to the objection Dr. Wilson makes to the noise, there is no\\n      doubt it is an annoying thing in the office, and in that line I have some\\n      men at work on my suggestion. We are devising another machine, or\\n      instrument, which is to be entirely enclosed in a cabinet, so there will\\n      be no noise whatever in the room if it is made a success. The idea is a\\n      little crude, and I am quite uncertain whether it will amount to anything\\n      or not. Then, in the line of what Dr. King was speaking in regard to Mr.\\n      Goodwin-he called, at New York, to see me last week. I made two little\\n      suggestion to him, which I think would be in line with his advancement.\\n      One is the number of the picks. The present vibrometer has four picks I\\n      suggest the experiment of trying twelve or sixteen picks, which will make\\n      a more continuous sound; it may be of some value. Then, in regard to\\n      regulating the speed of the machine: you regulate that now by a series of\\n      buttons, so as to get three different speeds. We will have a very slight,\\n      intermediate speed, and a very rapid speed. My experience with the\\n      vibrometer is especially favorable. I think the idea is in the right\\n      direction, and it is simply a matter of instrumentation.']\n",

Dietary sources of vitamin C include fruits and vegetables, particularly citrus fruits such as oranges.Severe deficiency of vitamin C causes scurvy. Although rare, scurvy results in severe symptoms and can cause death. People with scurvy are treated with vitamin C and should be under medical supervision.Many uses for vitamin C have been proposed, but evidence of benefit in scientific studies is lacking. In particular, research on asthma, cancer, and diabetes remains inconclusive, and a lack of benefit has been found for the prevention of cataracts or heart disease.The use of vitamin C in the prevention or treatment of colds remains controversial. Extensive research has been conducted. Overall, vitamin C lacked an effect on the development of colds and on cold symptoms. However, the duration of the cold shortened slightly. Notably, people living in extreme circumstances, including soldiers in the subarctic, skiers, and marathon runners, had a 50% decrease in the risk of developing a cold. This area merits additional research and may be of particular interest to athletes or people in the military.'\n",

Vitamin B12 is frequently used in combination with other B vitamins in a vitamin B complex formulation. Vitamin B12 is important in DNA synthesis. Vitamin B12 is bound to the protein in food. Acid in the stomach releases B12 from protein during digestion. Once released, B12 combines with a substance called intrinsic factor (IF) before it is absorbed into the bloodstream.The human body stores several years\\' worth of vitamin B12 in the liver, so low levels in the body are rare. Decreases in vitamin B12 levels are more common in the elderly, HIV-infected persons, and vegetarians.

Arginine is also found in many foods that have protein.Arginine becomes nitric oxide (a blood vessel-widening agent called a vasodilator) in the body. Early evidence suggests that arginine may help treat medical conditions that improve with increased vasodilation. These conditions include chest pain, atherosclerosis (clogged arteries), heart disease, heart failure, erectile dysfunction, peripheral vascular disease, and headaches from blood vessel swelling).Arginine also triggers the body to make protein and has been studied for healing wounds, bodybuilding, enhancing sperm production, and preventing tissue wasting in people with critical illnesses. However, caution is warranted. Arginine use was associated with death in some people with heart conditions. Caution is also needed when using arginine to treat pre-eclampsia (high blood pressure in pregnancy).Arginine hydrochloride has been used to treat metabolic alkalosis. This use should be under the supervision of a qualified healthcare professional.'\n",
      " 'Flaxseed and flaxseed oil (or linseed oil) are rich sources of the essential fatty acid alpha-linolenic acid (ALA). In the body, some ALA is converted to omega-3 fatty acids.Lignans are a type of plant hormone similar to estrogen. The lignan components of flaxseed (not flaxseed oil) may possess antioxidant properties and alter estrogen activity.As a source of fiber, flaxseed (not flaxseed oil) has laxative properties. In large doses, or when taken without enough water, flaxseed may cause bowel obstruction. The effects of flaxseed on blood sugar levels are unclear.Flaxseed oil contains only the ALA component of flaxseed and not the fiber or lignan components. Therefore, flaxseed oil may share the potential cholesterol-lowering properties of flaxseed, but not the proposed laxative or anticancer abilities.'\n",

      " 'Tresorie - The Present Status of Radiation in the Treatment of Malignant\\nConditions [Present Status Of Radiation in the Treatment Of Malignant\\nConditions]\\n ISIDORE ARONS, M.D.\\n      \\n New York, N.Y.\\n      \\n AT A meeting of the American Medical\\n      Association recently held in Cleveland, Dr. Joseph C.Bloodgood, in\\n      discussing a paper on radiation therapy, said that \"report at my\\n      clinic told me that 49 per cent of the patients previously operated on in\\n      the clinic now to for radiotherapy. This is based on results. They are not\\n      hopeless cases; they are still hopeful and they get well under\\n      radiotherapy. This has happened during the last three years, not because I\\n      have changed any but because the method of radiotherapy has changed. A\\n      great change has taken place. First of all, radium and x-rays are no\\n      longer looked on a last resort.\".\\n      \\n The foregoing bears witness to the\\n      progress made in the field radiation therapy. The manufacture of more\\n      adequate apparatus and the improved technic in its use reflect this\\n      improvement. Machines are used generally delivering twenty to thirty\\n      milliamperes of current at 200 K.V., while machines operating at 750 to\\n      1,000 200 K.V., using lower milliamperes, have been installed in several\\n      places in this country. Since the question of increased voltages began to\\n      dominate the field, machines operating at 400 to 600 K.V., using sealed\\n      tubes, have been manufactured in this country as well as on the been\\n      manufactured in this country as well as on the continent. This higher\\n      powered machines occupy little more space than the usual 200 K.V. machine.\\n      \\n The effectiveness of these stronger\\n      radiations is thought to be due to (1) the increased penetration and its\\n      consequently larger percentage depth doses, (2) the supposed higher\\n      selective action of short have length radiation on malignant cells, and\\n      (3) greatly increased x-ray output. Clinics using super-voltages report\\n      that clinical results are somewhat better than those secured through the\\n      use of the lesser voltage machine.\\n      \\n Experimental effort, from the physical\\n      and biologic point of view, has been exerted to establish to standard\\n      basis for radiotherapy since Roentgens discovery thirtyfive years ago, and\\n      its application five years later. Radiotherapists have only recently begun\\n      to understand the principles of clinical application or radiotherapy in\\n      the treatment of malignant conditions.\\n      \\n Regaud selected the rabbits testicle\\n      for his experiments because its histologic cellular structure was highly\\n      sensitive to radiation, containing cells which are in a state of active\\n      mitosis resembling that of malignant tissue. In 1922, Regaud reported that\\n      of malignant, tissue. In 1922, Regaud reported that it was impossible to\\n      sterilize the testicle by a single dose of radiation without causing\\n      serious damage to the overlying skin. The dose required to produced such\\n      radio necrosis was equivalent to about three radionecrosis was equivalent\\n      to about three erythemas when administered in one dose. However, by\\n      dividing the dose in such a manner as to prolong the treatment over a\\n      period of fourteen days, a total dose of about five erythemas could be\\n      given causing complete sterilizations without damage to the skin. Thus it\\n      is seen that by prolonging the time of treatment the cutaneous dose could\\n      be increased nearly 50 per cent without causing necrosis.\\n      \\n The above experiments were reported,\\n      and the same results determined, by Schinz and Slotopolsky in 1926, and\\n      again by Regaud and Ferroux in 1927. These experiments formed the\\n      foundation for the clinical studies of Pfahler (America), Hohlfelder\\n      (Germany) and Coutard (France), who have swung the pendulum from massive\\n      radiation, as advocated by the German school, to that of the protected\\n      fractional dose method. Results have been achieved by this method which\\n      are superior to previously reported; these are obtained by the improved\\n      method of administering a large dose to the (3 days) without causing\\n      destructive effects to the surroundings normal structure (or cancer bed);\\n      its effect are rather biologic than physical. The clinical application of\\n      the method of radiation by Pfahler, Countard, and Berven (Sweden) in the\\n      treatment of cancer of the tonsil, pharynx and larynx and have proved the\\n      radio-sensitive properties of squamous carcinoma, previously considered\\n      incapable of of responding to radiation.\\n      \\n According to Coutard, the neoplasm is\\n      exposed to x-rays twice daily, giving a total dose of 350 r to400 r to two\\n      areas, using 190 to 200 k.v., four milliamperes, two millimeters of copper\\n      and three millimeters of aluminum filtration at a distance of fifty of\\n      sixty centimeters, for lesion of the head and neck. For deeply situated\\n      lesions, such as cancer of the uterus, the focal distance varies from 80\\n      to 100 centimeters, the area of the field for the head and neck conditions\\n      being only 50 to 100 square centimeters, while those of the lower abdomen\\n      require on an average of 250 to 300 square centimeters. For the\\n      sterilization of the radio-sensitive squamous carcinomatous growth, a\\n      depth dose of 3,000 r to 4,000 r is given, while stronger dose is\\n      necessary for the radio-resistant tumors.\\n      \\n In the course of treatment of principle\\n      guides a radio reaction of the covering epithelium and the radio reaction\\n      of the cancer cells. The radio reaction of the cutaneous epithelium is\\n      called \"radio epidermitis.\"characterized by loss of epithelial\\n      layers and denudation of the dermis. The reaction of the mucous membrane ,\\n      called \"radio epithelitis,\" manifests itself by loss of the\\n      epithelial layer sand denudation of the mucous membrane, epithelial layers\\n      and denudation of the corium which becomes covered by a fibrinous and\\n      false membrane; of clear. The duration of both describe radio reactions is\\n      six weeks. Each appears at the beginning of three weeks and disappears at\\n      the beginning of the ninth week.\\n      \\n Should the total or daily dose or the\\n      intensity per minute be too high, or the filtration or the tension too\\n      low, the cancer bed would be modified. the nutrition of the malignant\\n      cells becomes impaired The cellular radio- sensitivity, which seems to be\\n      linked up not only with the mitosis of the cell but above all with the\\n      activity of their interchange with the cell but above all with the\\n      activity of their interchange with the surrounding normal structures,\\n      becomes diminished and at times suppressed. The cancer cells become\\n      incentive to radiation. This phenomenon is called \"radio-\\n      vaccination\" by Regaud.\\n      \\n Observation of clinical facts shows\\n      that changes in the surrounding normal tissue result from excessive daily\\n      doses and intensity per minute per minute causing radio resistance of the\\n      tissue. Conversely, radio- sensitivity would be prolonged with a smaller\\n      daily dosage and the resultant extended period.\\n      \\n Realizing that better results may be\\n      obtained by prolonged treatment, Coutard and his collaborators in the last\\n      few years have begun to extend the duration of treatment of certain\\n      so-called radio-resistant cancers from thirty to ninety days, giving weak\\n      daily doses in order of about 175, 220, 225 and 250 r per day, dividing\\n      the dose in two treatments. By this method he was able to cure a certain\\n      number of lesions on which he had not been able previously to obtain the\\n      same results, such as very differentiated epidermoid epithelioma invading\\n      the muscles and cartilages, glandular epithelioma of the breast ad the\\n      thyroid body, and special round celled epitheliomas of the upper part of\\n      the ethmoid and the adjacent sinuses. This mode of prolonged treatment not\\n      only controlled the condition locally but it lessened the frequency of\\n      metastasis.\\n      \\n When radiating a cancer of very\\n      embryonic, very radio-sensitive growths, the energy factor is predominant.\\n      The action of the x-rays seems to be direct and rapid; the treatment can\\n      be accomplished within fifteen to twenty days. The cells are destroyed and\\n      generally normal structures are affected very little. When radiating the\\n      less embryonic type of growths, the time of treatment should be longer.\\n      \\n Pursuing these general principles, I\\n      have adopted the Countard method with some slight modifications. The cures\\n      which I shall illustrate will show that the percentage of cures in a\\n      number of most dangerous epidermoid carcinomas has markedly increased and\\n      that some conditions formerly considered hopeless have been temporarily\\n      cured. In conclusion I wish to emphasize the following facts:.\\n      \\n (1) Cure of cancer by x-rays is still\\n      difficult and must not be entered into lightly and causally.\\n      \\n (2) Radiotherapy is just as radical in\\n      method as surgery, and requires great skill, judgment and experience.\\n      \\n (3) The cooperation of the pathologist\\n      and the radiotherapist is imperative for a proper estimate of the\\n      radio-sensitivity in relation to treatment of the lesion.\\n      \\n (4) Daily examination of the patient is\\n      necessary; modification of the normal structure and general reaction by\\n      the x-ray treatment sometimes appears to quickly that it is often\\n      necessary to diminish the daily dose or the size of the field in the\\n      course of treatment.\\n      \\n (5) There exists no fixed method of\\n      treatment, only a simple clinical treatment for each individual patient\\n      and for the special type of tumor..\\n      \\n (6) Improvement in roentgen apparatus\\n      of higher voltages, producing more penetrating rays, will permit a better\\n      relation between destruction of malignant cells and preservation of the\\n      supporting, and the radio sensitivity of the tumor may be prolonged.'\n",

This is the city where\\n      Homoeopathy was first introduced by Rajendra Lal Dutta of hallowed memory,\\n      who spent a princely fortune for dissemination of its principles and\\n      practice among his countrymen. This is the city where took place the\\n      dramatic conversion of one of the then medical luminaries of the first\\n      magnitude, to the practice of Homoeopathy under the influence of Rajendra\\n      Lal. I mean Dr. Mahendra Lal Sircar who became the high priest of\\n      Homoeopathy, spread its glory far and wide and gained thereby an\\n      international reputation for himself. This is the city where the\\n      celebrities of Homoeopathy like Dr. Berigny, Dr. Salzar, Dr. P.C.\\n      Majumdar, Dr. D. N. Roy. Dr. Younan, Dr. J.N. Majumdar, Dr. Baridbaran\\n      Mukherji, Dr. S.K. Nag, Dr. A.N. Mukherji, Dr. T.N. Palit, Dr. G.\\n      Dirghangi and a host of other talented physicians practised their\\n      profession with credit and success and held aloft the banner of\\n      Homoeopathy. This is the city where exist pioneer institutions for the\\n      teaching of Homoeopathy. This is the city wherefrom Homoeopathy has spread\\n      to all parts of India and its votaries are doing yeomans service for the\\n      good of the suffering humanity.\\n      \\n We are meeting this evening on a\\n      historic occasion and we have to arrive at decisions which might make or\\n      mar the future history of Homoeopathy in India. It may be that forces of\\n      disruption, destruction and obstruction are at work; it may be that self\\n      and vested interests seem to thwart the smooth progress of Homoeopathy; it\\n      may be that some may seem to play in the hands of the Powers that are not\\n      too sympathetic to the cause of Homoeopathy; it may be that the present\\n      seems to be chaotic and future of Homoeopathy dubious but great is truth\\n      indeed and will prevail. We should not lose heart or throw up the sponge.\\n      Tradition, authority, sectarianism, dogmatism are great obstacles on the\\n      way. But obstacles and difficulties are meant to be fought out and\\n      overcome. Strifes and dissensions, discords and disunities may hamper our\\n      progress but they are nonetheless signs of lifes activities. It is a good\\n      augury that the Homoeopathic profession is shaking off its age - long\\n      slumber and getting more and more conscious of its duties and obligation,\\n      its rights and privileges and of its short - comings and practical\\n      difficulties. The life of Hahnemann is there to encourage us; the\\n      masterful will of his dynamic spirit is there to inspire us to intensify\\n      our activities; his achievements are there to goad us to realise greater\\n      success; and his personality is always before us to take lessons from, in\\n      our life which as Swami Vivekananda puts it, is \"a process of\\n      unfolding and development of a being under circumstances tending to press\\n      it down.\"\\n      \\n That Homoeopathy is a scientific system\\n      of treatment, philosophically sound, logically unimpeachable, practically\\n      highly efficacious in curing the sick and cheap enough to suit the poor\\n      economic condition of the Indian masses - has become a much talked - of\\n      subject in the country. But why is it not spreading sufficiently and\\n      adequately in our motherland or in fact anywhere in the world? Why is our\\n      National Government not still keen on according official recognition to\\n      this superb system of healing art or providing ways and means for its\\n      development and diffusion? Why the public opinion is not gaining strength\\n      enough to put sufficient pressure on our Government to take interest in\\n      it? Why sufficient number of fully equipped Homoeopathic teaching\\n      institutions and hospitals are not growing to turn out adequate number of\\n      fully qualified Homoeopathic physicians in the country?\\n      \\n It is high time that we should draw the\\n      attention of the profession and the laity to provide answers to so many\\n      \"whys\" and to solve the pressing problems in the matter\\n      concerned. On a cursory view it becomes evident that the Homoeopathic\\n      profession, the people and the Government are each individually and\\n      collectively responsible for this impasse.\\n      \\n The so - called Allopathy still\\n      occupies the dominant place in any country, even in the land of birth of\\n      Homoeopathy. It is no wonder that Homoeopathy, being a discovery of merely\\n      a century and a half still lags behind its rival shool. But it is a wonder\\n      of wonders that Homoeopathy has already encompassed the whole world within\\n      such a short period since it was ushered into existence by Hahnemann.\\n      History of man reveals that nowhere a new truth was accepted by him easily\\n      and readily, obsessed as he is with conservatism, tradition, authority and\\n      vested interests. Nonetheless the triumphant march of Homoeopathy with a\\n      such a meteoric speed throughout the length and breadth of the world is a\\n      proof positive of the truth inherent in the system and phenomenal\\n      therapeutic efficacy of this healing art. It is one more glaring instance\\n      of mans love of truth against heavy odds that impede his progress at every\\n      step.\\n      \\n For the propagation of any new truth\\n      and its acceptance by man, in general, the first and foremost condition is\\n      the turning out of sufficient number of persons who have realised the\\n      truth and are adept in the practice of it. This involves establishment of\\n      a sufficient number of teaching institutions which will turn out experts\\n      in the science and art of Homoeopathy; and a sufficient number of\\n      Homoeopathic Hospital where, the efficacy of this system of treatment will\\n      be put to test.\\n      \\n Human knowledge is becoming\\n      unmanageably vast. The appearance of specialists has become indispensable.\\n      So special Hospitals for the treatment of specific types of diseases have\\n      sprung forth elsewhere, e.g. Tuberculosis Hospitals, Cancer Hospitals,\\n      Hospital for Tropical Diseases etc. Because of organisation of these\\n      hospitals people generally think of getting themselves treated in these\\n      institutions. As there are no fully - equipped general Homoeopathic\\n      Hospitals and not to speak of special Homoeopathic Hospitals and not to\\n      speak of special Homoeopathic Hospitals the result is Homoeopathy is not\\n      getting a fair chance of treating those diseases like tuberculosis,\\n      cancer, acute infectious diseases of epidemic type e.g., Small-pox,\\n      Cholera etc. on a large and organised scale. Consequently the general\\n      public cannot keep much faith in this treatment and mostly take recourse\\n      to homoeopathic treatment when the case is \"past all hope and past\\n      all surgery\". Hence the establishment of fully - equipped\\n      Homoeopathic institutions (College - cum - Hospitals) is an imperative\\n      necessity for enhancing the prestige of the Homoeopathic profession and\\n      for convincing the people about the therapeutic efficacy of this system of\\n      treatment. Is it not a pity that Homoeopathy once established its\\n      reputation by treating Cholera cases in this city and now nobody thinks of\\n      this treatment in Cholera cases and rushes the patient to the Allopathic\\n      Hospitals which are especially meant for these types of patients? How can\\n      we hope to gain ground under these circumstances?\\n      \\n The next great obstacle is the apathy\\n      and in many cases active antagonism of our Government, both at the Centre\\n      and at least in some of the State, towards Homoeopathy. The Government is\\n      under the thumb of its medical directorates which are solely manned by\\n      Allopathic doctors. The main reasons for the non - acceptance of the\\n      Homoeopathic system of treatment may be summed up in three words:\\n      tradition, authority and professionalism. Their psychology is easily\\n      understood if it is borne in mind that the conservative inertia of human\\n      mind attempts to reject any new thought will all the means at its\\n      disposal. Another reason is due to vested interests. Even a cursory glance\\n      at the history of origin and spread of Homoeopathy, enables one to find\\n      out that the opposition to this system from the start, was not scientific\\n      but rather of commercial nature on the part of the apothecaries who were\\n      afraid of losing their trade - profits. We regret to note that the Central\\n      Government have not yet implemented a single recommendation put forward by\\n      the Homoeopathic Enquiry Committee, Planning Commission. Third Health\\n      Ministers Conference, Ad Hoc Committee etc. though Homoeopathic Acts have\\n      been passed in the States of Bombay, U.P., Madhya Pradesh, Travancore -\\n      Cochin, Bihar etc. I is curious to note that W. Bengal is the only State\\n      where a Homoeopathic Bill has recently been thrown out by the State\\n      Government.\\n      \\n Another great obstacle is the\\n      psychology of the general mass of population who fail to adopt a proper\\n      philosophical attitude towards Homoeopathy and takes the Homoeopathic\\n      Therapeutic Law as great paradox contrary to common sense. Unless we can\\n      educate the public in the matter, we cannot hope to secure their whole -\\n      hearted support for this system of treatment.\\n      \\n Lack of enthusiasm for constructive\\n      works on the part of the Homoeopathic profession, the apathy of our\\n      Government and hesitancy on the part of the public to accept Homoeopathy\\n      are great obstacles to the spread of this system of treatment in the\\n      country. Unless this vicious circles is broken the progress of Homoeopathy\\n      is bound to be impeded. We have to fight on all fronts if we aspire to\\n      achieve victory in our battle for the cause of Homoeopathy and the\\n      suffering humanity.\\n      \\n But our first necessity as pointed out\\n      by the Soul of India expressing itself through Sri Aurobindo, is: If India\\n      is to survive and do her appointed work in the world, the youth of India\\n      should learn to think, to think on all subjects, to think independently,\\n      fruitfully, going to the heart of things, not stopped by their surface,\\n      free of pre - judgements, shearing sophism and prejudice asunder as with a\\n      sharp sword smiting down obscurantism of all kinds as with a mace of\\n      Bhima.\\n      \\n \"Let our brains no longer, like\\n      European infants, be swathed with swaddling clothes; let it have recover\\n      the free and unbound motion of the Gods, let it have not only the\\n      minuteness but the wide mastery and sovereignty natural to the intellect\\n      of Bharata and easily recoverable by it if it once accustomes itself to\\n      feel its own power and be convinced of its own worth.\\n      \\n \"The old fixed foundations have\\n      been broken up, we are tossing in the waters of a great upheaval and\\n      change. It is no use clinging to the old ice - floes of the past, they\\n      will soon melt and leave their refugees struggling in perilous waters. It\\n      is no use landing ourselves in the infirm bog, neither sea nor good, dry\\n      land of a second - hand Europeanism. We shall only die there a miserable\\n      and unclean death.\\n      \\n \"No we must learn to swim and use\\n      that power to reach the good vessel of unchanging truth; we must land\\n      again on the eternal rock of ages.\"\\n      \\n Yes, we must expand, we must assimilate\\n      whatever is assimilable for our growth. Stagnation and contraction are the\\n      signs of Death. Our knowledge must be aggressive, must diffuse through the\\n      rank and file of the whole Homoeopathic profession if we wish to survive\\n      and perpetuate ourselves; to leave an extensive ignorance either below or\\n      around us is to expose ourselves to the perpetual danger of being\\n      exterminated as a professional entity.\\n      \\n In fine, I welcome you, once again, on\\n      this historic occasion to this historic city to deliberate, to exchange\\n      view points and to come to agreed decisions with regard to our future line\\n      of action in respect of Homoeopathy in all its aspects.'\n",
      " 'Tresorie - SOME OBSERVATIONS ON NEURASTHENIA AND ITS TREATMENT\\n[Neurasthenia & Treatment]\\n\\n WHEN, thirty-five years ago, the writer\\n      first made the acquaintance of what is now called neurasthenia, it was\\n      known as spinal irritation, and the best of modern researches have been\\n      unable to give a better definition beyond a functional disturbance of the\\n      spinal and cerebral nerves, dependent on a morbid process, for which\\n      \"irritation\" is as proper a term as any. As deaths do not occur,\\n      autopsies throw no light on the subject. Briefly stated, neurasthenia,\\n      when observed from the beginning through its chronic course, has a period\\n      of prodromal symptoms followed by a protracted acute, and succeeded by a\\n      still more protracted chronic, state, between the end of which and the\\n      beginning of convalescence there is a very vague, often indiscernible,\\n      boundary line.\\n      \\n The prodromal symptoms are quite\\n      indefinite and very variable, pointing to nothing in particular. Loss of\\n      appetite, irregular sleep, excitability alternating with lassitude, etc.,\\n      are often overlooked, especially when the second stage-display of unusual\\n      mental and physical energy without subsequent fatigue- becomes apparent.\\n      This is often mistaken for a sign of unusually good health. When a young\\n      girl or mature woman, married or unmarried, feels that she can study ten\\n      hours a day and devote half of her night to pleasure or business; when\\n      besides much mental occupation she begins to rejoice in long walks without\\n      fatigue, that is the time when the mischief is going on without exciting\\n      timely suspicion. Relief is at last sought when the functional disorder of\\n      the nerves has gone to the opposite extreme, and becomes manifest in what\\n      is properly and popularly termed \"nervous prostration,\" when\\n      instead of having no sense of fatigue, the best bodily or mental effort\\n      seems intolerable, in grave cases rendering the patient a helpless being,\\n      completely dependent on the unremitting assistance of others whom she )it\\n      is usually a woman) rules with the inexorable power of the vis inertiae.\\n      \\n During this usually very protracted\\n      period of the disease convalescence usually sets in, but so imperceptibly\\n      that the physician alone can sometimes estimate its progress, which is\\n      unnoticeable to others towards whom the patient acts as she has for months\\n      or years. This is the time for action, too often delayed from motives of\\n      misplaced sympathy on the part of relatives and friends.\\n      \\n The affections is in many instances\\n      limited to the spine, the mind becoming only secondarily tired. In other\\n      cases it is spinal and cerebral; in others again chiefly cerebral. The\\n      line between this and insanity is always clearly definable. Though a\\n      neurasthenic patient may become insane, and probably the reverse, yet both\\n      are distinct conditions.\\n      \\n Books speak of this disease at common\\n      to men and women. Yet in this region in small towns as well as in large\\n      cities the cases of neurasthenia in women are preponderatingly great.\\n      \\n Hypochondriacs and hysteria stand in\\n      peculiar relation to neurasthenia. They maybe regarded as different\\n      species of the same genus; that is, more or less deeply seated\\n      disturbances of the cerebro-spinal system in which the sympathetic system\\n      is probably indirectly involved, as many functional disturbances presided\\n      over by the great sympathetic system often testify. Hypochondriasis, pure\\n      and simple as occurring in men, is easily distinguishable by its striking\\n      characteristic of introspection and despondency, occasioned by abnormal\\n      sensations, without marked physical weakness and tiredness. Pure\\n      hypochondriacs are often energetic, conscientious workers. In hysteria\\n      there is neither great tiredness nor tendency to introspection, but a\\n      paroxysmal or prolonged absence of the power of self control, in grave\\n      cases associated with tonic or clonic muscular spasm and loss of\\n      consciousness. While neurasthenia in its uncomplicated forms is free from\\n      these symptoms, but, as ample experience teaches, often complicated with\\n      both of the preceding forms to such an extent that it is often very\\n      difficult to tell which is primary and which secondary. The symptoms known\\n      as introspection, hysterical aberrations of the emotions, and neurasthenic\\n      sense of exhaustion are in their distinctive manifestations most important\\n      and constitute indications in the selection of remedial and dietetic\\n      measures.\\n      \\n The following are some observation of\\n      peculiarities observed in a large number of cases and peculiar to all:.\\n      \\n Introspection.-The neurasthenic patient\\n      in variably expresses her desire for relief, not so much in a direct\\n      appeal as in a supplicating, subdued tone of voice and manner. She rarely\\n      asks, \"What can you do to relieve me?\" but almost invariably,\\n      \"What is the cause of\" this or that sensation? If she is\\n      introspective, that is, hypochondriacal, she becomes a nosomaniac,\\n      watching acutely every one of her numerous distressing sensation, on the\\n      unremitting analysis of which her mind dwells. In marked cases she is\\n      quite unable to think of anything outside of herself, and in many cases\\n      dislikes to do so, preferring to river her attention on herself. Attempts\\n      to divert her annoy or anger her. Friends and relatives implore the\\n      physician to divert the patient, but all their attempts are in vain\\n      because quite misdirected.\\n      \\n Positive and Negative Will.-It seems\\n      sometimes as if the patient delights in her self-inspection, and that she\\n      prefers her condition to speedy recovery. This is not the case, for the\\n      patient will always assure the physician of her wish to get well. During\\n      the acute stage-a long yet definable period-this wish and longing cannot\\n      well be utilized, but the long and ill-defined period of convalescence\\n      must first be awaited. Here we shall always discover that the wish and the\\n      will of the patient are two very different mental conditions. The desire\\n      or wish for recovery is entirely unattended by any will effort to\\n      accomplish the desired end. The injunctions and directions of the\\n      physician are resisted by the same unconquerable power of negative power,\\n      or vis inertiae. The patient having been unable to exert her will, now\\n      thinks herself unable to use it.\\n      \\n Numerous Symptoms of Patients.-To\\n      physicians in search of indications for medicines each statement of\\n      patient concerning a sensation is apt to be considered as a symptom. Many\\n      years ago, when resolved to get at the keynote of a patient\\'s case, the\\n      writer determined to allow the patient to detail all her symptoms as long\\n      as she chose and to take accurate notes of each one till the right one\\n      should be disclosed; and this was to be done regardless of time and\\n      exertion. The patient, one who needed no urging to describe her\\n      \"symptoms,\" began in an almost inaudible voice, detailing one\\n      sensation after another with an unrivalled degree of clearness and\\n      vividness of expression; as she proceeded the voice became stronger, her\\n      face slightly flushed, and the most perfect descriptive language flowed in\\n      an endless stream. Each word was written down, page after page was filled;\\n      still she went on with unmistakable signs of satisfaction at being able to\\n      pour her pent-up emotions into willing and sympathetic ears. If, for a\\n      moment, the flow of language was interrupted, a simple question would\\n      re-animate her to proceed with renewed energy. Feelings seemed to beget\\n      feelings; their complexity gave the patient no trouble; her intellect was\\n      equal to the action of unraveling the most complicated sensation,\\n      separating them into their component parts and spreading them out before\\n      the mind of the listener. A glance at the watch showed that nearly two\\n      hours had passed, during which the feeblest of neurasthenic patients had\\n      talked incessantly. The note-book was full, the keynote was found. It was\\n      this: neurasthenic patients have innumerable sensation and exhibit no\\n      sings of fatigue after talking incessantly for nearly two hours.\\n      \\n Great Endurance of Neurasthenics.-The\\n      instance just related, which is one of many, illustrates two things. One\\n      is, that it is not the kind of sensation described but the fact that\\n      neurasthenics have innumerable sensations, that constitute the symptoms.\\n      The other thing is that many neurasthenics are capable of great exertion\\n      without suffering disagreeable after- effects from fatigue. This is\\n      illustrated by other cases of which I have notes. A highly neurasthenic\\n      young lady consented to camp out for her health near a lake. She was\\n      induced to join a party for a short walk along the lake. By trying what\\n      they thought a shorter road the party lost their way and took a very long\\n      walk of about four hours, through bogs and over forces. The neurasthenic\\n      was less fatigued than some of the others. The interesting observation was\\n      subsequently made that the patient had become interested in a young man of\\n      the party. She recovered her health within a year from that time. Other\\n      cases of this kind will appear under the head of therapeutic suggestions.\\n      \\n Neurasthenic Patients Crave\\n      Sympathy.-This is one of the most formidable obstacles to the curative\\n      management of such cases, for the kind of sympathy such patients crave is\\n      expressions of condolence and more or less deep affliction at so much\\n      suffering as the patient expresses. Such sympathy is most natural and does\\n      honor to the feelings of parents, sisters, brothers and husbands, but it\\n      is unfortunate that the deeper their expression of affliction so much the\\n      more profound will be the mental dejection and weakness of the patient.\\n      Almost every case which has come under the writer\\'s observation has been\\n      much hampered if not made hopeless by this condition of things, against\\n      which no remedy suggests itself that would not be construed as\\n      \"unkind\".\\n      \\n The origin of this very formidable and\\n      refractory nervous disease, like that of most diseases usually termed\\n      chronic, is either hereditary or acquired, as the histories of every\\n      observed case plainly testify. Either the father was a hypochondriac or\\n      the mother neurasthenic, or both parents were of unsound nervous\\n      constitution. Dipsomania on the part of parents produces neurasthenia in\\n      the children, as readily as it will be followed by any other form of\\n      nervous disease, according to the individual predisposition of the\\n      offspring. The excessive use of tea and coffee is another very active\\n      factor in the history of neurasthenics. Where fathers inclined to alcohol,\\n      mothers are addicted to tea and coffee, which, while its immediate effects\\n      do not obtrude themselves upon our notice, are none the less insidious in\\n      their more remote consequences.\\n      \\n The acquired forms of neurasthenia are\\n      of utmost interest to the therapeutist, and the sources of acquisition are\\n      readily stated. They are much brain-work with insufficient food and sleep.\\n      Such conditions obtain chiefly in women (less frequently in men) of fine\\n      intellectual ability, conscientiousness and ambition. Physical overwork\\n      with unintellectual women has no such effect. Quite analogous to the above\\n      are the conditions of care and sorrow, especially in women who are able\\n      for a long time to conceal and control their emotions. The usual\\n      consequence of such states of mind is disregard of food and insufficient\\n      sleep. Instances of acquired neurasthenia are presented in families of\\n      several girls and boys, where one or more of the former are Neurasthenic\\n      while the latter are vigorous and athletic. Boys delighting in vigorous\\n      exercise do not, as is the case with girls, lose appetite and sleep.\\n      \\n The effects of nervous exhaustion in\\n      boys are usually much less grave than in girls; as a rule such effects are\\n      manifested in mental, not muscular, tiredness, and they are relieved by\\n      air and exercise, while in girls and women those influences are shunned\\n      because they seem to increase the tiredness.\\n      \\n Predisposition-The temperament, or what\\n      in modern pharaseology is called the personal equation, plays a visible\\n      but uncontrollable part in the progress of neurasthenia, as temperament\\n      greatly determines the other imperfectly known condition known as\\n      predisposition. Where the disease is hereditary, it is easy to say that\\n      the predisposition is due to that source; where there is no history of\\n      heredity and where neurasthenia exists in the last members of a\\n      generation, it may be attributed to acquired predisposition which needed\\n      only the exciting cause to establish the disease in its most typical form.\\n      \\n One of the most common forms of\\n      neurasthenia, often quite intractable, results from a serious defect in\\n      our public school system, one which affects chiefly girls from twelve to\\n      fourteen years of age. The following is a brief example: The child rises\\n      late with no appetite for breakfast and no time to eat it if so inclined.\\n      The lessons, however, have been learned the evening before, and the school\\n      work is begun with an ambitions will and a crammed mind, and continues\\n      with one intermission of often not more than ten minutes or three of four\\n      hours. The pupil arrives at home ravenously hungry, eats too fast, and too\\n      much of injudiciously prepared food, too long in digesting to leave room\\n      for an appetite for even a light evening meal, or even for a breakfast the\\n      next morning.\\n      \\n In another case the girl or boy grows\\n      desperately hungry while at school, but being unprovided with food\\n      (lunch), goes on with the school exercises, at the end of which the sense\\n      of hunger has vanished and has been replaced by an aversion to normal\\n      food, with a possible craving for something pungent and indigestible. This\\n      observation can easily be made in many instances, and will, in as many\\n      cases, be seen to lead to nervous prostration, which is then treated by\\n      vile, patented concoctions consisting largely of whiskey, under the name\\n      of \"tonics,\" while the patient needs only the best that a\\n      legitimate market affords prepared in a sensible manner.\\n      \\n Typical Cases Ending in Rapid\\n      Recovery.-Curative results have already been indicated in what has been\\n      said above, and further indications for treatment may be gathered from a\\n      few cases of extremely rapid recovery of apparently incurable cases, to\\n      which brief allusion will here be made. A woman of forty had been a victim\\n      of grave neurasthenia for five years. In the absence of an inclination to\\n      exert himself, she had, during that period, been mostly confined to her\\n      bed or lounge, in the meantime giving birth to two children, going through\\n      gestation and confinement normally, without recovering from neurasthenic\\n      prostration which, in the course of some years more, rendered her entirely\\n      helpless. Her condition was associated with a feeling of dropping to\\n      pieces unless supported and braced by a harness of wood, iron and leather,\\n      in which she \"sat up\" for several hours each day, spending the\\n      rest of the time in bed. Having left the patient in this condition, it was\\n      reported before the writer\\'s next professional visit that Mrs.-had been\\n      cured, and that she was able to go out like other people. A visit to the\\n      house confirmed the report. The patient came to the door herself, and in a\\n      quiet manner, entirely without the least expression of joy or wonder at\\n      her release, stated, that having heard of a famous \"magnetic\\n      physician,\" she summoned him, was ordered by him to arise and stand;\\n      protesting that it was impossible, she was raised to her feet and again\\n      ordered to stand, then to walk. Fearing that she would fall, she begged\\n      the magnetic doctor to support her, which he peremptorily refused, saying\\n      she might fall if she liked. Instead of falling, she had to walk about the\\n      room, was then placed upon a lounge and subjected to a severe treatment of\\n      rolling and pummelling, and then ordered to dress and sit up until tired,\\n      to remain up and about like other people, and to call on the doctor in\\n      future, as he would not come so far to the patient again. This happened\\n      about twenty-five years ago, and the patient has been in very fair health\\n      arrested by insisting that all professional visits by the writer or any\\n      other physician to whose sympathy the patient could appeal must cease.\\n      This injunction was carried out conscientiously with the best results by\\n      the husband of the patient. Perhaps we may learn from this that sometimes,\\n      at least, the familiar motto is reversed, and angels rush in where fools\\n      fear to tread.\\n      \\n Profiting by this experience, another\\n      neurasthenic woman, unmarried, but of most intractable, antagonistic\\n      temperament, confined to her bed, in and out of hospitals, for years,\\n      wearing out the strength and means of her relatives and the patience of\\n      many physicians, was at length abandoned by them. It was a case of spinal\\n      and cerebral neurasthenia complicated with hypochondriasis in its most\\n      trying form of introspective maunderings and endless description of\\n      symptoms. She tormented her advisers by her endless tirades, the\\n      indulgence of which invariably aggravated her condition, and were there\\n      fore avoided, until once her physician yielded to the patient\\'s\\n      importunities for a visit, when be found her in her usual abject state of\\n      prostration. Guided by experience derived from cases like the one first\\n      described, he assisted the patient to her feet and marched her, will you\\n      nil you, up and down the room until he, at least, was thoroughly tired,\\n      and then departed with the promise never to do so again. The patient, on\\n      her part, made a number of her unnameable promises, but kept on her feet\\n      and let the doctors alone. Though not cured of deeply-rooted morbid mental\\n      faults, the neurasthenic phase of her condition had yielded to the change\\n      of the antagonistic element of her character from passive to very\\n      practical activity. A third very serious case of this kind occurred in the\\n      person of a girl of fifteen, of selfish character, who gradually became\\n      bed-ridden with spinal and cerebral neurasthenia, and tormented with the\\n      usual multifarious painful sensations, none of which, on the most\\n      pains-taking physical examination, resulted from demonstrable organic\\n      disease of genital or abdominal organs. The patient was most tenderly\\n      cared for by her mother, who, in the course of years, became so imbued\\n      with the idea of yielding to every wish and whim of the patient, that at\\n      length remonstrance became useless. The mother, though recognizing the\\n      importance of persuading or urging her daughter to depend more on herself,\\n      admitted that she had yielded so long that now she must continue to feed,\\n      dress and assist her charge in the most trivial things. Her food had to be\\n      placed in her mouth, the position of a hand or foot changed by some one\\n      else, although patient did so spontaneously when she chose. This went on\\n      for fifteen years, when the mother, growing old and feeble, died. Her\\n      maternal support being gone, the patient at once proved her ability to\\n      walk, to dress, to feed herself, and to seek light employment. Though far\\n      from well, she is equally far fro being a helpless, bed-ridden invalid.\\n      \\n A fourth case, still very vividly\\n      impressed on the writer\\'s mind, was one of a healthy, romping girl of 14,\\n      who, as happen in this remarkably capricious disease, in the midst of\\n      perfect health, one day took to her bed and remained there with all the\\n      symptoms of neurasthenia, involving first the spinal and finally the\\n      cerebral nerves. This patient was very amiable, conscientious, and\\n      sensible, never loquacious, and not troubled with hypochondriacal thoughts\\n      or sensations. Tiredness was the only expression she used in describing\\n      her feelings. There was literally no variation from this condition, which\\n      confined her to her bed for years, till she grew from a girl to a woman.\\n      Eating and sleeping well, and improving perceptibly in personal appearance\\n      and character, yet she lay on her couch tired and watched over with\\n      unremitting care by a most anxious mother, showing her solicitude and\\n      sympathy in every feature. Once, in the second year of the disease, a\\n      favorable interruption occurred. The mother, still a young woman, gave\\n      birth to another child. During her confinement the neurasthenic patient\\n      was in charge of her mother\\'s nurse, assisted by other servants. The\\n      nurse, while devoted to the daughter, agreed with the writer that excess\\n      of sympathy was injurious, and used her best and judicious endeavors\\n      gradually to persuade the patient to make some physical effort at walking\\n      and standing. In this she was so successful that in two weeks she\\n      accompanied the girl on half-mile walks up and down hill, finally without\\n      assistance. Thus, recovery seemed assured, and everything was favorable\\n      progressing towards it when the mother, having fully recovered, again took\\n      charge of her daughter, with the result that she at once took to her\\n      lounge and remained there two years longer. About that time other advice\\n      was urged and gladly acceded to, with the result that the case was\\n      diagnosed by an eminent surgeon as spinal paralysis in consequence of\\n      concussion, though it could never be shown when and where it occurred.\\n      Salves, plasters, anodynes, nervines, and electricity did no good, but\\n      effectually destroyed appetite and digestion, which higher to had been\\n      normal. So this adviser resigned in favor of a third, who, being a younger\\n      and less prejudiced man, agreed perfectly with the writer\\'s original\\n      opinion. He advised return to moderate exercise, avoidance of drugs, and\\n      less display of sympathy. This, though formerly rejected as\\n      \"unkind,\" was now acceded to as coming from a nerve- specialist,\\n      fresh from Europe, at that time very rare. Still attending the other\\n      members of the family, the writer had sample opportunity of observing the\\n      course of the case. Improvement was very slow and uncertain till financial\\n      misfortune overtook the family. Almost with a bound our patient left her\\n      cough, and, organizing a kindergarten, strove energetically in supporting\\n      herself and assisting her mother. The change came about in less than three\\n      weeks, and resulted in perfect recovery.\\n      \\n At this point another very instructive\\n      case of very speedy recovery, after six or seven years of neurasthenic\\n      prostration, deserves to be mentioned. A woman of 35 had been in bed and\\n      on the lounge most of the time for nearly seven years, at the end of which\\n      time she became my patient, her regular medical attendant having gone to\\n      Europe. She was of very amiable disposition and as sensitive as she was\\n      weak. Her symptoms, as in the other cases, were instantaneous exhaustion\\n      on the least physical exertion. She could give herself up to no mental\\n      occupation beyond directing her house-hold affairs, the education of her\\n      son, and the rehearsal of her numerous sensations. She had not been my\\n      patient long when her husband failed in business, so that the family was\\n      reduced from very comfortable circumstances to a condition which made it\\n      necessary for the patient to make her own living and that of the family.\\n      This she almost at once proceeded to do, setting aside all other\\n      considerations and establishing a boarding-house, where she did most of\\n      the work herself. This she has done now for ten or twelve years without a\\n      serious relapse. The time involved in the period of convalescence was\\n      scarcely more than three weeks, a although her work maybe said to have\\n      begun at the moment her resolution was taken.\\n      \\n Prognostics.-From these and other cases\\n      in and outside of the writer\\'s practice, it is safe to say that the\\n      majority of cases of neurasthenia recover, though years may elapse before\\n      that period. We learn, furthermore, that recoveries, especially of very\\n      inveterate cases, depend on conditions beyond the control of the\\n      physician, as was the case in the above-recorded instances, where\\n      circumstances forced the patient to cases to wish for recovery and to make\\n      an effort of the will. This having been once accomplished self-confidence,\\n      for a long time in abeyance, was permanently restored.\\n      \\n Curability, further, depends very much\\n      on the temperament of the patient, whether amiable, tractable and\\n      confiding in the honest endeavors of the physician, or whether refractory,\\n      suspicious, untruthful, selfish and antagonistic, of a disposition\\n      impossible to win over on account of unnatural distrust of every\\n      well-meaning person. The degree of intelligence of patients also has a\\n      pronounced influence on the result. The most readily curable cases are\\n      those acquired without hereditary predisposition, where the cause is found\\n      in the absence of food and sleep, also where sorrow and anxiety can be\\n      averted or counteracted by judicious conduct of near relatives and\\n      friends.\\n      \\n Dietetic Treatment.-This, as medicinal\\n      treatment, must be governed by the stage at which the case comes into the\\n      physician\\'s hands-whether yet in its prodromal, its acute or its chronic\\n      phase. The prodromal stage of the disease has no very decided\\n      pathognomonic signs. The most that can be recognized in this stage is that\\n      the patient\\'s habits or duties are of a kind which will eventually lead to\\n      obdurate neurasthenia if not arrested in time by removing the exciting\\n      causes. Too much pleasure, as well as too much care, especially in girls\\n      and woman, tends to neglect of food and rest, in the absence of which,\\n      excitements, whether of pleasure or care, begets a state of unrest in\\n      which repose is disagreeable. With such a condition comes a list of\\n      incipient casual complaints of headache, imperfect sleep, notional ways of\\n      eating, working or playing. A few questions will determine whether the\\n      patient is living according to normal or abnormal habits with regard to\\n      appetite, sleep and occupation. Where these are found, their alteration to\\n      normal ways must be instead on. It is unnecessary to say that this is\\n      easier said than done, for it will probably meet with serious objections\\n      on the part of the patient, if not on that of her relatives; for most\\n      likely she has examinations for college to prepare for, involving several\\n      months of dose and careful study at night, and the patient cannot waste\\n      time in sleeping and eating while cramming that little excited and\\n      ambitions brain. A failure in the examinations would be as much of a\\n      disappointment to parents as to patient, who proves, as usual, that this\\n      appellation is a misnomer. She accordingly goes in as she please, lied by\\n      an increasing morbidly ambitions impulse, and the result is likely to be\\n      the mournful satisfaction on the part of the physician of being obliged to\\n      say, \"I told you before what would happen.\" Of course, all\\n      regret the now evident nerve-prostration, while, if the doctor had\\n      succeeded in enforcing his rules, he would in many cases experience the\\n      still more painful reproach of having been too severe. Nevertheless,\\n      absolute firmness and a kindly but unflinching exertion of his will,\\n      without the least compromise, reward the physician with the best results\\n      in such cases.\\n      \\n When the case, after the stage of\\n      excitement and untiring restlessness (at which it would still be speedily\\n      curable by simple dietetic rules) has, after weeks or months, entered upon\\n      the phase of painful prostration, here we encounter backache, oppressive\\n      headache, and absolute loss of mental or bodily endurance, measures of\\n      dietetic management are much less effective and much more difficult to\\n      find. it is at this stage that slight rise of temperature will occur,\\n      especially towards evening; then the backache and headache disappear, the\\n      pallor is replaced by a flush of color, the eyes lose their listless look,\\n      and the patient is inclined to enter upon some diversion or excitement,\\n      followed by a restless night and a morning of exhaustion and a renewal of\\n      all painful sensations. Most of such patients feel much better in the\\n      evening when they are ready for some entertainment, while in a normal\\n      state this would be the time for relaxation and repose.\\n      \\n The dietetic treatment of this stage is\\n      methodical rest. In severe cases the patient will do well to remain in bed\\n      for several days or even for weeks. It is well to shorten this period as\\n      much as possible and to insist on walking about, or, at least. sitting for\\n      a specified time every day. This may be varied b equally specified periods\\n      of rest in the recumbent position.\\n      \\n Irregularities of eating are at this\\n      and at all times to be superseded by the most rigid regularity of meals.\\n      The traditional and conventional three-meal system, however well adapted\\n      to the needs of a vigorous man or woman, does not agree with the\\n      neurasthenic patient. It is much better that these should eat oftener;\\n      four times a day is best in most cases, for the simple reason that in this\\n      way a patient, while eating less at a time, consumes more food in the\\n      aggregate.\\n      \\n As neurasthenic patients are rarely\\n      troubled with absolute aversion to wholesome food, they are generally able\\n      to consume a liberal quantity, about which it is only needful to remark\\n      here that the food should be selected from among the articles and dishes\\n      which the patient likes, provided they belong to the order of good, normal\\n      articles of food, to the exclusion of those which simply please the taste\\n      without being digestible. A dish entirely of meat or \"animal\\n      food\" is as far from being a good diet for neurasthenics as one\\n      consisting entirely of \"vegetable\" food. As a rule, the diet\\n      list should comprise one-third of nitrogenous material and two-thirds of\\n      carbohydrates. Together with these, it is a great mistake to neglect the\\n      fats, such as good butter and the fats of meats. And, lastly, every\\n      patient of this kind should be made to drink some water often, a dietetic\\n      feature too often neglected.\\n      \\n During this stage, actually fatiguing\\n      exercise of body and mind should be avoided, while, on the other hand, the\\n      patient\\'s mind should be directed away from herself, in which she is much\\n      assisted by withholding a certain kind of emotional sympathy, quite as\\n      natural as it is difficult to repress on the part of affectionate persons.\\n      Of this, a few words further on.\\n      \\n There is no definite time for the\\n      duration of this stage, which, however, depends largely on the time during\\n      which the exciting causes have acted, either aided by or without a\\n      predisposition. It is certain, however, that the sooner it is recognized\\n      and the exciting causes eliminated, so much the sooner recovery will\\n      begin. But there is a stage at which the best of experience and judgment\\n      often fail, especially in very inveterate cases. If the case is one of a\\n      patient whom the physician has had opportunity of watching at least since\\n      the earlier stages, the difficulty is not so great as it is in old cases\\n      months or even of several years\\' duration which come to treatment late. In\\n      these, the line between the intermediate stage and incipient convalescence\\n      cannot be drawn. The patient is as neurasthenic and hypochondriacal as\\n      ever; cannot bear the slightest mental or bodily exertion, not even a word\\n      or a look, without sings of apparent exhaustion, while nearly the whole\\n      time is spent in bed under anxious care of sympathetic attendants. In such\\n      cases, having become assured, by careful physical examination, of the\\n      absence of organic disease, seeing the patient generally well nourished\\n      and in fair muscular condition, the physician is warranted in assuming\\n      that the disease has run its course, that whatever morbid (pathological)\\n      process there may have been progressing in the nervous system, this\\n      process has now come to and end, but it has left the patient\\'s mental\\n      condition habituated to the moods of the past months or years, and fixed,\\n      as it were, indelibly in the memory. It is the habit that now remains, not\\n      the disease.\\n      \\n If reasonably sure of this, and calling\\n      to mind the rapid recoveries and the circumstances attending them, as\\n      above detailed, the physician is now safe in ordering a more energetic\\n      treatment, calculated to rouse the self-reliance of the patient. All\\n      visible signs of sympathy must now be set aside; the actins and demeanor\\n      of the attendants should, from this time, if not before, be changed so as\\n      to give the patient the impression that she is no longer an invalid, but\\n      expected to rely on her own exertion. Instead of being fed, the food\\n      should be placed where she must go for and eat it. She should now be\\n      expected to dress and attend, without assistance, to her natural wants.\\n      This, with some temperaments, is almost impossible, with al extremely\\n      difficult. The best course to pursue is to remove such patients from\\n      sympathetic relatives or friends, and to place them in charge of kind,\\n      reliable, but eminently practical nurses.\\n      \\n The first effect of this is either to\\n      throw the patient into a stage of helpless despondency, which, again\\n      appealing powerfully to the sympathies of those nearest to her, often\\n      frustrates the physician\\'s plans which, if firmly but kindly adhered to,\\n      would, ere long, prove of their superiority by signs of returning\\n      self-reliance and absence of complaints on the part of the patient. A\\n      second form of effect is that occurring in patients of obstreperous,\\n      selfish disposition, whose opposition and even anger is aroused by being\\n      thrown on their own resources after the removal of depressing and\\n      unpractical sympathy. This opposition or temper, often manifested in all\\n      sorts of intrigues and subterfuges on the part of the patient, if not\\n      supinely yielded to by sympathetic persons, will finally be replaced by a\\n      more rational disposition. On the whole, anger or active opposition are\\n      signs of returning energy, which, once coming to the consciousness of the\\n      patient, takes the form of self- reliance. it is this way that the cures\\n      of chronic cases above related can be explained, and physicians should\\n      profit by such experience for the benefit of their patients.\\n      \\n The general dietetic management now\\n      readily follows from what has been said, and needs only a few general\\n      modifications. The first duty of the physician will be to test the degree\\n      of reliance to be placed on the patient and her friends, ad to win them\\n      over if possible to his plans, and his success will be in proportion to\\n      the degree of confidence he is able to inspire. This personal confidence\\n      should not degenerate into a mere personal liking or attachment of a\\n      sympathy-craving neurasthenic who should discover henceforth that all\\n      sentimental expressing of sympathy are about to take a practical form,\\n      aiming at a definite result-the patient\\'s health-which she wishes but\\n      cannot exert her will to attain. The best and often the only way to do\\n      away with sentiment and to reach practical kindness is to remove the\\n      patient from certain home influence, and to place her in a hospital or\\n      elsewhere under the management of competent nurses who, without being\\n      selfish, know how to exert a certain amount of wholesome push as fast as\\n      the patient can bear it. Without the removal of sentimental sympathy, all\\n      efforts at counteracting the purely hypochondriacal side of neurasthenia\\n      are useless.\\n      \\n In these cases of neurasthenia as yet\\n      uncomplicated with the hypochondriacal element of introspective nosomania,\\n      there is only one unconditional rule to be followed, especially in\\n      acquired cases whose evident cause was incessant, conscientious work of\\n      mind and body, together with insufficient food and sleep. Such cases come\\n      on very insidiously, the loss of strength-that is, the actual waste of\\n      nerve-substance-being just a trifle grater than the quantity restored, the\\n      patient unconsciously using up a minute part of her capital every day.\\n      Here the rule should be to reverse matters to insuring a supply of\\n      nourishment and time for its assimilation greater than was the case\\n      heretofore. The case of young school-girls belong in this class. The time\\n      of food and rest should be carefully controlled at home, the duty of the\\n      physician being to educate indifferent and ignorant parents up to an\\n      appreciation of the nature of the case. It is generally not difficult to\\n      open their eyes through the medium of their anxiety concerning their\\n      children\\'s health. Having thus insured sufficient rest and food at home,\\n      the physician\\'s next object of attention should be the regulations of the\\n      school. Here is the point where teachers have an opportunity of exerting\\n      their most practical influence. It should be made obligatory on the part\\n      of teachers to institute inquiry as to whether pupils have had their meals\\n      before coming to school. This they could often ascertain without a\\n      question, by reading the pupil\\'s condition in her emaciated form, pale\\n      face and nervous manner. To guard against neglect at home, it would be an\\n      easy matter to insist that all pupils of public and private schools should\\n      bring with them some proper food. The few who do so generally bring\\n      sweets-an apple, orange or a few dry crackers-when a piece of good bread\\n      and slice of cold meat would be what they actually need. All pupils should\\n      pass inspection, and if remiss in this important particular, the\\n      delinquent should be dismissed with several marks against her. To expect\\n      this of teachers would be a great advance in the place of futile\\n      innovations of endeavoring to send forth from our common schools graduates\\n      in arts and sciences.\\n      \\n Sudden Effects.-A large number of cases\\n      of neurasthenia, especially those complicated with inveterate\\n      Hypochondriasis, are frequently traced to some sudden occurrence, having\\n      the effect of a mental or physical shock. In one patient, a vigorous girl,\\n      used to romping, climbing and running lie a boy, the cause was supposed to\\n      be a slight thump she received during a game of blindman\\'s-buff. She\\n      thought nothing of it at the time, but it was suggested long after the\\n      patient\\'s illness began. In another case some mental shock of joy or\\n      grief, not very severe and such as is often experienced in every person\\'s\\n      life, is the beginning of months of nervous prostration.\\n      \\n There is quite an array of evidence\\n      that neurasthenia which has entered upon a hypochondriacal stage or\\n      complication with or without a strong hysterical admixture, is curable by\\n      sudden impressions in the form of a shock, or more gradually by frequent\\n      repetitions of an impression. Such cases, as I have shown above, occur\\n      most commonly in the stage when what may be considered the essential\\n      pathological disturbances of function have run their course and have left\\n      the patient in a state of mental disturbance which indicated that the\\n      patient\\'s recovery depends entirely upon her volition. But there is none,\\n      and so far nothing has succeeded in arousing it. Persuasion is as useless\\n      and irritating, as argument would be in a case of insanity with a fixed\\n      illusion. The resemblance between this and the state of mind of a\\n      hypochondriacal neurasthenic is very close. She cannot move nor thick.\\n      Exhaustion overcomes her and keeps her its victim for years, when suddenly\\n      the scene changes, and a few days or weeks suffice to restore the patient\\n      to activity. In one instance it is attributed to medical, in another to\\n      \"mind cure,\" in a third to \"Christian science;\" in\\n      still other cases massage has done it, in others again \"magnetic\\n      influence,\" in others the very powerful factor necessity. It is\\n      certain that cases of this kind, produced by sudden effects on the mind of\\n      a predisposed person, are also cured by such effects. Whatever the visible\\n      form of these effects may be -whether that of \"Christian\\n      science,\" joy, grief or absolute inexorable necessity, there is\\n      always to be noticed a certain force and condition involving the modern\\n      idea of suggestion, which comes to the patient in an irresistible degree\\n      and now sets the function of the will in motion again.\\n      \\n Experience teaches that it is by no\\n      means a matter of indifference which of these forms of effect are brought\\n      into action. In one case it is the professional Christian scientist\\'s\\n      method, in another the almost brutal exertion of a person\\'s will combined\\n      with some physical force. In either case the patient is aroused from his\\n      inertia, and discovers his powers of mental and bodily ability to act.\\n      \\n A deplorable result is that recoveries\\n      after such effects are attributed in the popular mind to supernatural\\n      causes. That such is not the case may be gathered form instances occurring\\n      in very sensible and intelligent patients, whose reason is scarcely ever\\n      so far disturbed and weakened that they do not resent the proposition of\\n      trying, e.g., Christian science or mind cure.\\n      \\n Nevertheless, it is the mind cure which\\n      the intelligent patient needs quite as much as the ignorant and\\n      superstitious person; the difference is only the form in which the\\n      influencing force is applied. While in one case it is obedience to the\\n      candidly expressed instructions of the physician, in the other case the\\n      result is the to mystification. In either case it is the powerful stimulus\\n      of hope and aroused confidence that recovery will be realized.\\n      \\n The definition of suggestion does not\\n      fully cover the meaning, because the influence employed is greater than\\n      mere suggestion. The physician\\'s plan of action should be straightforward\\n      assurance of recovery, a direct appeal to hope, and an unceasing endeavor\\n      to arouse the self-reliance of the patient, not so much by verbal\\n      exhortations as by a manner and department from which the patient learns\\n      more readily than from words what is expected. If the attitude of the\\n      physician is appreciated, and seconded by the relatives and attendants, a\\n      favorable result is much more certain to follow.\\n      \\n Hypnotism is not advisable. There are\\n      now existing ancient neurasthenic invalids dating from the times of\\n      spiritualism when they were famous \"mediums.\" Hypnotism weakness\\n      the will and nervous endurance, and produces a predisposition to emotional\\n      nervousness with an intractable erotic admixture. The suggestions sought\\n      to be instilled into a hypnotized patient amount to nothing. The mental\\n      influence of mystical treatment administered while the patients is awake\\n      is much more powerful in awaking hope and confidence than the uncertain\\n      effects of an abnormal state like that of hypnotism. Mystification, again,\\n      though sometimes unavoidable with the best intention, is less powerful\\n      than direct and intelligible encouragement. While resort to mystification\\n      should be shunned by reputable physicians, the question arises as to what\\n      shall be done with the many who, from lack of intelligence or education,\\n      are entirely beyond the reach of honest common sense, and who will persist\\n      in mystifying themselves, who remain neurasthenic invalids in spite of the\\n      best regulations of the physician, and who do not recover unless their\\n      encouragement follows some mystical formalities which alone arouse their\\n      \"faith\" and finally their confidence and will-power. For the\\n      present there is no way out of the dilemma but to submit such patients to\\n      the suggestive methods of what is popularly known as mind cure and\\n      Christian science. In doing so, physicians should use their influence as\\n      far as possible in selecting the most honest persons of this class.\\n      \\n DISCUSSION.\\n      \\n JAMES C. WOOD, M.D.: I have nothing but\\n      words of praise for Dr. Wesselhoeft\\'s excellent paper. It is very evident\\n      that the author\\'s inspiration came not from books but from actual contact\\n      with neurasthenic subjects, for the impress of originality is most\\n      conspicuous. It is a production which could only come from one of\\n      experience and from a reasoner. I consider it a most valuable contribution\\n      to the literature of that now most interesting subject,\\n      \"neurasthenia\".\\n      \\n The doctor, in his paper, has sometimes\\n      used the term \"neurasthenia\" instead of\\n      \"neurasthenia.\" The first of these means, according to Thomas,\\n      great nervous power or excitement; the second, nervous debility. I taken\\n      it from the context that the subject dealt with is neurasthenia. To the\\n      average mind there exists what seems to me a needless confusion regarding\\n      the terms, nervous prostration, hysteria and hystero-neurosis. As I\\n      understand these terms they define distinct conditions, though there is a\\n      frequent blending the one with the other. The term nervous prostration,\\n      which is a synonym of neurasthenia, defines itself; the term hysteria\\n      should be restricted to those general neuroses characterized particularly\\n      by psychical manifestations, though not infrequently by motor, sensory,\\n      secretory, vasomotor and reflex derangements as well; while the term\\n      hysteroneurosis implies the uterine origin of symptoms manifesting\\n      themselves in organs remote from the uterus without structural changes in\\n      such organs, being the direct result of reflex nervous influence starting\\n      from the uterus. The last term does not occur in the paper under\\n      discussion. From the standpoint of a gynecologist I think that this is\\n      misleading.\\n      \\n Let us see why and how it is that these\\n      three conditions (I will not call them diseases) are so frequently\\n      associated. I think that all will admit the frequent occurrence in woman\\n      of reflex symptoms, the result of pelvic lesions. An irritation staring\\n      form the pelvis is conveyed to the genito-spinal centre, thence to any or\\n      all organs with which this centre communicates. The organ oftener involved\\n      than any other is the stomach. This is shown by the frequent occurrence of\\n      nausea and vomiting following conception. The nervous system may have been\\n      previously involved, but oftener it becomes so only after the nutrition is\\n      depraved, which, sooner or later, occurs if the pelvic lesion is not\\n      removed. The depraved blood fails to supply the nerve centres with that\\n      which they need to sustain them, and they become anaemic. Prostration is\\n      but a subjective manifestation of the anaemia, and it varies in degree\\n      from a slight indisposition to the most abject helplessness.\\n      \\n If, then, nervous prostration may have\\n      its beginning in a pelvic lesion, is it possible for a pelvic lesion to be\\n      inaugurated by systemic disturbances? Personally, I believe that it is,\\n      and offer this explanation as the modus operandi by which such a lesion is\\n      induced: Marked circulatory changes nearly always attend nervous\\n      prostration. The circulation is presided over by the vaso-motor system,\\n      and wear and repair depend upon the proper regulation of this system. If\\n      it becomes disturbed, the bloodvessels dilate or contract unduly, with\\n      resulting local hyperaemia or local anaemia, as the case maybe. The\\n      climacteric flushes are the result of such disturbance. The alternate\\n      coldness and heat of the extremities, so often associated with rectal and\\n      uterine lesions, is another familiar illustration. If the brain is\\n      involved, either insomnia or drowsiness occur, depending upon whether the\\n      brain is anaemic or hyperaemic. Flatulence, gastralgia, and nervous\\n      dyspepsia result when the stomach is similarly affected. The womb and the\\n      ovaries, because of the periodical congestion imposed upon them, are\\n      oftener implicated by these unnatural circulatory disturbances than any of\\n      the pelvic organs, and in time also become unduly hyperaemic or anaemic,\\n      as the case may be.\\n      \\n It will thus be seen that nervous\\n      prostration may exist independently of pelvic lesions, or, conversely,\\n      pelvic lesions may exist independently of nervous prostration.\\n      Nevertheless, the two are frequently associated, and this fact ought, I\\n      believe, to be kept in mind in dealing with the affection known as\\n      neurasthenia. Hysterical manifestations nearly always come to the surface\\n      in nervous prostration, and they also frequently attend pelvic lesions.\\n      Indeed, the term \"hystero-psychosis\" has been coined for the\\n      purpose of defining certain psychical disturbances of presumably pelvic\\n      origin, and in the broadest sense neurasthenia is not uncommonly an\\n      hysteroneurosis. It is the frequent association of these three conditions\\n      which, it seems to me, makes it more practicable to study them conjointly.\\n      \\n The special symptoms of nervous\\n      prostration are most variable. Introspection, as Dr. Wesselhoeft has\\n      pointed out, makes of the patient a nosomaniac. The anaemic nerve centres\\n      are unduly impressionable, and a mental shock which would not seriously\\n      affect a stronger and more rugged woman falls with crushing force upon one\\n      whose nutrition is already depraved. In this way are developed disorders\\n      of sensibility, alternations of mobility, circulatory disturbances,\\n      anomalies of secretion and exertion, disorders of the gastro-intestinal\\n      canal, dermatoses, and general and psychical disturbances of all kinds.\\n      Many of these affections start from pelvic lesions, and are nearly always\\n      associated with depravity of nutrition and more or less nervous\\n      prostration.\\n      \\n Some of the worst symptoms of\\n      neurasthenia with which I have had to contend have been hyperaesthesia of\\n      the articulations, giving rise to the so-called \"hysterical\\n      joint.\" Here the prostration is usually not profound, and it is\\n      possible to apply the somewhat energetic treatment recommended by Dr.\\n      Wesselhoeft. I remember one case very distinctly, the detailed history of\\n      which I shall give in another place, which brought me much reputation\\n      because of the \"remarkable\" cure I was fortunate enough to make.\\n      \\n The patient, a beautiful girl of\\n      eighteen, had been bed- ridden for three years with supposed hip-joint\\n      disease. She was in college before assuming the ride of an invalid, and\\n      worried much over her studies and work. She sustained a fall a short time\\n      previously to taking to her bed, and to this fall the injury to the hip\\n      was attributed. She had been from physician to physician and from\\n      sanitarium to sanitarium without receiving benefit. All of the numerous\\n      medical men under whose care she had been, directed their attention to the\\n      hip and applied the classical treatment for morbus coxarius without avail.\\n      The patient had finally reached a point where introspection was her chief\\n      occupation and her mind dwelt almost continually upon a \"diseased\\n      hip.\" She was finally brought to me, coming in an invalid\\'s chair and\\n      looking the very picture of dependency. There was a slight degree of\\n      anaemia, though this was not marked. Notwithstanding the expression\\n      expression of abjectness the girl did not look seriously ill. The hip was\\n      excessively tender upon pressure, but there was no local increase of\\n      temperature, no evidences of fever and suppuration, and forcible\\n      apposition by striking the heel was not very painful. More less spastic\\n      contraction of the flexor muscles of the affected side existed, which gave\\n      to the limb an appearance of actual shortening, which was very deceptive.\\n      Hysterical symptoms were common. On examination I found the left ovary\\n      exquisitely tender. Compression of the ovary increased the pain in the hip\\n      most decidedly and gave rise to much nervous agitation. I did not,\\n      therefore, deem it wise to recommend local treatment other than the daily\\n      use of the hot douche. She had long been a victim of ovarian\\n      dysmenorrhoea. I placed upon the ankle of the affected limb three pounds\\n      of bar-lead, prescribed a pair of crutches and insisted upon her walking.\\n      The lead was used to overcome the spastic contraction as well as for its\\n      moral effect. I did not deem the joint lesion of such a character as to\\n      used extension. In two months\\' time this patient discarded her crutches\\n      for a cane. Six weeks later she put up the cane and is now perfectly well.\\n      \\n This was a case in which somewhat harsh\\n      measures were eminently appropriate.\\n      \\n In marked contrast to the case just\\n      recorded is the following: Mrs.-, aet. 47, widow for twenty years. She is\\n      a devoted church-woman, and for years was a leader in all charitable work\\n      done in the community in which she resided. Through friends she was urged\\n      to consult me, and I think that the call to the neighboring town in which\\n      she lived was countermanded at least four or five times before the finally\\n      mustered up courage and strength enough to see me. Upon reaching the\\n      bedside I found my patient in a room made dark by closed blinds, over\\n      which were hung heavy blankets to shut out every ray of light. The mirror\\n      was turned toward the wall for fear a ray of light might strike it and\\n      flesh throughout the darkened room. Nor did the patient rest under these\\n      extreme precautions, for the eyes were protected with two pairs of colored\\n      glasses with side attachments. Hyperaesthesia of the sense of hearing was\\n      equally marked and the noise was excluded from the room by double doors\\n      whose keyholes were stuffed with cotton. She l so had her ears filled with\\n      cotton, over which she wore ear-mufflers. She was emaciated to an extreme\\n      degree, and had been reduced to her miserable condition by a series of\\n      events which frequently precede profound neurasthenia. Her husband was\\n      killed during the war, and she was left childless. Twelve months previous\\n      to taking to her bed she nursed her mother through a long and fatal\\n      illness. This greatly prostrated her, yet she kept up until a favorite\\n      brother-in-law was thrown from a carriage and killed. This was the last\\n      straw, and the shock compelled her to take to her bed. In due time loss of\\n      appetite with irritability of the stomach developed, which, of course, led\\n      to marked depravity of nutrition. With the anaemia came hyperaesthesia of\\n      the special senses, spinal irritation, headache, hysterical\\n      manifestations, etc. There was no series pelvic lesion, although she had\\n      been much treated for an alleged uterine displacement with congestion.\\n      Unfortunately, she was encouraged, instead of discouraged, in her\\n      invalidism, and she soon became a nosomaniac of the worst type. She had\\n      written down her symptoms one at a time, and the record is such a typical\\n      one that I should like to give it in full, but time forbids.\\n      \\n With great difficulty the patient was\\n      moved on a cough to a private hospital and placed under the Weir Mitchell\\n      treatment. I ignored the pelvic trouble entirely. It is unnecessary to\\n      give in detail the progress of the case from day to day after this\\n      treatment was inaugurated. Suffice it to say that the improvement was of\\n      the most marked character, and in six weeks from the time she entered the\\n      hospital she walked to her carriage with her eyes and ears unprotected.\\n      She soon resumed her church and charitable work, in which she again takes\\n      much delight.\\n      \\n This woman wanted to get well. She was\\n      a woman of pure motives and high ideals. She had, in the language of Dr.\\n      Wesselhoeft, the wish, but, unaided, not the will. She required the aid of\\n      an intelligent, strong-minded, nurse who could bring to her exercise\\n      applied in such a way as to enable her to assimilate food without the\\n      expenditure of nerve force. She co- operated with her physician and nurse\\n      in every possible way, and as soon as the anaemic nerve cells became\\n      flushed with new blood she began to improve. To have commanded this\\n      patient \"to take up her bed and walk\" before improving her\\n      nutrition would have been as unscientific as to have placed the first\\n      patient in bed with extension and counter-extension applied to the limb. I\\n      know of no class of cases requiring for their successful treatment more\\n      tact and discrimination than that under consideration.\\n      \\n I feel confident that I have many times\\n      cut the affection short in its prodromal stage by removing the girl from\\n      college work and insisting upon open-air exercise. Static electricity has,\\n      in my hands, proved exceedingly useful both during the prodromal stage and\\n      that of convalescence.\\n      \\n I will conclude by saying that I have\\n      been impressed with the frequency with which an hereditary history of\\n      epilepsy has been met with in the cases of neurasthenia passing under my\\n      observation.'\n",
      " 'Tresorie - SOME OF THE DISEASES PREVENTING AND COMPLICATION PREGNANCY\\n[Diseases Preventing & Complicating Pregnancy]\\n\\n STERILITY.-DeSinety, Treub, Furbinger,\\n      et al., attribute 50 per cent. of unproductive marriages to the husbands,\\n      saying that sterility in the male is more often the cause of barren\\n      marriages than is generally supposed.\\n      \\n This cause of sterility I pass by, as\\n      also sterility due to mechanical obstruction, incomplete ovulation and the\\n      numerous other causes of this condition, too manifold for mere\\n      enumeration, to consider obesity as a causative agent in this condition. I\\n      need not say that the advocates for surgical interference for the relief\\n      of this condition are legion. Sims makes the assertion that sterility can\\n      be cured by surgical means only. That, of course, is Allopathic arguing\\n      pure and simple. Cases requiring surgical interference do arise, but any\\n      treatment which raises the nutrition of the entire organism, improves the\\n      blood-formation, and favors the resorption of pathological products in the\\n      sexual organs, is to be regarded as the indicated remedy.\\n      \\n Published statements are my authority\\n      for saying that excellent results have followed the administration of\\n      drugs, nevertheless; and in complete defiance of all therapeutic measures,\\n      a certain percentage of women remain barren; for with the more occult\\n      causes of sterility we remain, as yet, unacquainted, consequently they\\n      cannot all be reached with say kind of treatment whatever.\\n      \\n The following case I report somewhat in\\n      detail. Whilst not an exceptional case at all, it bears directly upon the\\n      subject under consideration, and possesses, it seems to me, some decidedly\\n      interesting features. My object in selecting this particular one is to\\n      call attention, if possible, to a condition not sufficiently considered.\\n      Mrs. J., aet. 26, married about two years and a half, appealed to my\\n      knowledge for a reason as to why she remained childless. The lady was\\n      carrying an excess of flesh, being under the medium height, and weighing\\n      186 pounds, but appeared to be in good health; family and previous history\\n      all that could be desired. Examination showed none of the common causes of\\n      sterility; neither, so far as I could ascertain, was the husband\\n      responsible for this unproductive condition of affairs. Some previous\\n      experiences of my own, with the added testimony of other and able men, was\\n      my reason for charging this condition of things to the excess of flesh,\\n      this, by the husband, being laughingly charged to excess of laziness.\\n      \\n We all, undoubtedly, are familiar with\\n      that peculiar disease of the blood-corpuscles which, whilst producing\\n      flesh, relaxes at the same time the muscular force; acting also, I\\n      believe, upon the muscular fibres of the uterus and upon the ovaries,\\n      inducing not only serious menstrual disorders but sterility. McKee,\\n      Philbert, and others give several instances of sterility chargeable to\\n      obesity, the women in question having been married several years without\\n      bearing children, and all became mothers after losing a portion of their\\n      flesh. If any other argument were needed in support of this theory we\\n      might turn to the quadrupeds, where we find the poorest breeders among the\\n      fleshiest animals. Fournel has a very able treatise on \"The Effects\\n      of Obesity on the Menstrual Functions and Parturition.\" Without\\n      having had any actual case of this description to deal with, he inclines\\n      very strongly towards the belief that obesity favors sterility. In the\\n      treatment of the case before mentioned, the patient was subjected to a\\n      daily massage of the entire body, with a special pelvic massage three\\n      times a week. This, in the main, consists in elevating the uterus as high\\n      as possible with the finger in the vagina, ending with a quick and decided\\n      vibratory motion. The diet received particular attention, as at this time\\n      there was a slight gastric ailment. The indicated remedy, Thuja, was given\\n      in the minimum dose. At the end of three months almost thirty pounds of\\n      flesh was gone, a considerable reduction. As an experiment, I recommended\\n      coitus in the knee-elbow position, advising that the lady remain quiet as\\n      long as possible after coition, with thighs well flexed. She became\\n      enciente, but miscarried at eight weeks. There was, comparatively\\n      speaking, but little pain and not much subsequent haemorrhage. She made a\\n      rapid recovery. Since then a living child has been born to them.\\n      \\n I believe I am safe in saying that this\\n      result would hardly have obtained were it not for the prophylactic\\n      measures adopted.\\n      \\n At the end of the first two months the\\n      patient was attacked with haemorrhage. A similar occurrence took place at\\n      irregular intervals during the following five months, the quantity of\\n      blood lost being much greater than that at the normal menstrual period.\\n      \\n For the greater part of the last five\\n      months she kept her bed, at the end of which time the tendency of the\\n      uterus to empty itself could be resisted no longer. A seven months\\' child\\n      was born, and is to-day doing well.\\n      \\n Pseudocyesis cerebral pregnancy,\\n      phantom pregnancy (whatever name we may call it by) is a disease which\\n      must come under the head of those \"complicating pregnancy.\" Mrs.\\n      M., a lady, married two or three years, aet. 29. Previous history good,\\n      always enjoying perfect health. When I first saw the lady in question she\\n      was a perfect picture of health, and, according to appearance and her own\\n      statements, about seven months pregnant. I made no examination. This\\n      appeared to be a thoroughly intelligent woman, and, according to her own\\n      statement, there was cessation of the menses. There certainly was an\\n      enlargement of the abdomen and breasts, a milky secretion, and the lady\\n      was sure that she felt foetal movement. On February 28th of the present\\n      year I was called to attend her in labor. Examination showed that no\\n      pregnancy existed. So far as I could ascertain there was no assignable\\n      origin for this condition other than nervous influences, the phenomena\\n      being purely muscular distension of the abdomen.\\n      \\n Mayham reports a case of a woman 73\\n      years old, claiming to be pregnant; he also claims that subsequently she\\n      was delivered of a child; this is an Allopathic report, however, of which\\n      we will take a Homoeopathic dose. Haultain reports three cases of cerebral\\n      pregnancy. In the first, he says no cause whatever was to be found; in the\\n      second, there was a small fibroid growth in the anterior uterine wall.\\n      Hauck reports a case where the vomiting, peristalsis, and flatus, caused\\n      by alcoholism were supposed to be caused by the pregnant state. Such cases\\n      are uncommon, but they emphasize the importance of making a thorough\\n      examination, in all cases where positive information is desired of the\\n      existence or non-existence of pregnancy.\\n      \\n Hyperemesis Gravidarum.-An animated\\n      discussion, held recently between two celebrated Allopaths of Stuttgart\\n      and Leipsic, has served to awaken a renewed interest in this subject,\\n      without in the least adding anything new to our stock of knowledge\\n      regarding its aetiology. Notwithstanding the frequency of the vomiting of\\n      pregnancy, its very distressing character in many instances, and its\\n      imminent, its very distressing character in many instances, and its\\n      imminent danger, we find but very few contributions of any value, to\\n      either the aetiology of the disorder or its therapeutics. I do not expect\\n      to add anything specially new myself, but it does seem to me that our\\n      knowledge of the vomiting of pregnancy, is to say the least, in a most\\n      contradictory state. Some physicians look upon it as a trifling matter,\\n      others as a thing to be endured, and some-these are in the right too-view\\n      even the mildest cases with gravity. Even in the mildest cases of morning\\n      sickness there is a constant drain upon the nervous system, putting the\\n      sufferer into a condition, in which she is very much less able to endure\\n      parturition than she would otherwise have been.\\n      \\n Dr. Harrison Mettler says: \"After\\n      careful inquiry I find that women who suffer from much morning sickness\\n      have as a rule, tedious or otherwise troublesome labors. I have observed\\n      in multiparae that at one time they will have much nausea and vomiting\\n      followed by a difficult labor, while at another time they will be quite\\n      free from the vomiting, and will pass through the succeeding labor with\\n      comparative ease.\" I must say my observations make me agree with Dr.\\n      Mettler entirely; when one thinks how rapidly the mildest of cases assume\\n      pernicious forms, indifference is certainly no longer to be excused. There\\n      is a voluminous literature upon this subject, and many and varied are the\\n      aetiological reasons given for this very variable affection, a large\\n      majority of writers coinciding in the opinion that \"many causes\\n      operate together,\" to produce what we are pleased to designate the\\n      \"vomiting of pregnancy.\" I believe myself that in a large\\n      percentage of cases, this pernicious vomiting is simply the result of a\\n      reflex neurosis. Undoubtedly uterine displacements frequently cause\\n      vomiting; but when this is so, and the displaced organ is raised by\\n      packing the vagina with aseptic wool, the vomiting ceases.\\n      \\n Lillie reports a number of cases, where\\n      obstinate vomiting was caused by a retroflexed uterus, and restoration of\\n      the organ caused a cessation of the disorder. Bezugloff having a\\n      persistent case of morning sickness, introduced a bougie it no the uterus,\\n      the intention being to produce abortion; the immediate result was a\\n      stoppage of the vomiting, and the pregnancy went on to full term.\\n      \\n In the case just cited, I must say that\\n      I believe it was the fright, caused by the thought of abortion being\\n      performed, more than the effects of introducing the bougie, which operated\\n      so successfully; I say now, as I said before, I believe that the\\n      pre-eminent cause of this kind of sickness must be looked for i the\\n      nervous system. Flint speaks of this form of sickness as being decidedly\\n      neurotic in its origin, and cites a number of cases of a chronic variety\\n      of dyspepsia frequently occurring in young girls. I had one such case come\\n      under my personal care. There was a persistent morning sickness, with this\\n      young lady, and a disagreeable nausea whenever food was taken; this\\n      patient was at some distance from her home, in a boarding school, and she\\n      will probably never know that the lady principal entertained very grave\\n      thoughts at one time in regard to her virtue. It certainly was very\\n      difficult to differentiate between this and the vomiting of pregnancy; it\\n      was, however, simply due to a vitiated nervous system. My theory is\\n      supported by Alt, who records a number of such cases; I cite one only, the\\n      case being that of a highly hysterical woman, six months pregnant,\\n      suffering from the gravest vomiting, and anxious that miscarriage be\\n      induced. She was making preparation for entering the hospital for this\\n      purpose, when one of her children was seized with pneumonia. The anxiety\\n      felt over the child, forced all thought of self from the mother\\'s mind;\\n      from that moment the vomiting ceased and she remained well until the\\n      termination of pregnancy.-Minchener Medicinische Wochenschrift.\\n      \\n Whilst saying that I believe this\\n      disease to be in the majority of cases of purely nervous origin, I would\\n      not imply thereby that it is not to be feared, far from it; if neglected,\\n      we know how likely it is to pass quickly beyond treatment and our patient\\n      succumb from sheer exhaustion.\\n      \\n In the treatment cited such as\\n      insertion of bougies, dilation of the os, pelvic massage, etc., I believe\\n      it is merely the \"doing something,\" no matter much what it is,\\n      so long as you have gained the confidence of your patient, that does good.\\n      We have seen how suddenly Hyperemesis will cease if the patient be\\n      alarmed; it may be, has often been, and will to again, cured by a process\\n      skin to suggestion. Kattenback had a case where the patient, a primipara,\\n      was seized with an incorrigible vomiting. It was suggested to her that her\\n      stomach contained some lumps of unwholesome material and their removal\\n      would cure her. Some milk was given her, and the stomach ceremoniously\\n      washed out. its contents bore no indications of either over-acidity or\\n      abnormal ferment She was informed that she was all right and the vomiting\\n      would not return; neither did if, and she was safely delivered at term.\\n      \\n There is a familiar and now well-know\\n      phenomena, by which these neurotics can be influenced; I speak of\\n      hypnotism; it is due to purely subjective conditions.\\n      \\n There is an identity of the hypnotic\\n      susceptibility with the condition of hysteria, and it is along these lines\\n      that we can work. Just as many times as I have tried this method of\\n      treatment, for these cases of excessive vomiting, just so many times has\\n      it given me gratifying results.\\n      \\n The patient can be to sleep by\\n      bi-ocular pressure, and the idea of cure suggested; the operation may have\\n      to be repeated several times, at intervals of a day or so, but you will be\\n      rewarded by the cessation of the vomiting, often with but one suggestion.\\n      Where the patient is not easily controlled by means of the bi-ocular\\n      pressure, Luy\\'s revolving mirror is a never failing resource.'\n",
      " 'Tresorie - PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS [Presidential Address]\\n\\n THE ROLE OF HOMOEOPATHY IN THE SECOND\\n      \\n By ALVA BENJAMIN, M.B.CH.B., F.F.HOM.\\n      \\n Such a system of medicine must\\n      recognize that it is as much an art as a science, and that healing is a\\n      relationship between two living personalities. It must recognize too, that\\n      the sick individual has to take an active part in his treatment and not be\\n      merely the passive recipient of this or that treatment. For just as it is\\n      rightly said that man does not live by alone, so should it be emphasized\\n      that man cannot be cured by medicine alone. He must see to it himself that\\n      he lives as far as possible a physically and psychically healthy life.\\n      Indeed, each individual has a power within himself to help in his own\\n      cure.\\n      \\n Do the official schools of medicine\\n      teach such an art today? I am afraid not: they are so intent on seeking\\n      the specific treatment for this or that named disease or the antibiotic\\n      that will most effectively put out of action the organism regarded as the\\n      cause of the disease, that they are losing sight of the individual\\n      himself.\\n      \\n But Homoeopathy in its persistent\\n      search for the reactions of the individual to his environment in the\\n      broadest sense, no matter of what the patient is complaining surely\\n      fulfills these requirements, especially when it is recognized that the\\n      homoeopathic potencies do not anything to the patient as do the drugs of\\n      the dominant school, but rather stimulate the patients own recuperative\\n      powers to overcome the infection or re - establish the normal metabolism\\n      which has become deranged by the illness.\\n      \\n When you consider how the homoeopathic\\n      physician diagnoses the individuality of his patient over and above the\\n      name of the disease from which he is suffering, and uses for the purpose\\n      of his prescription rather than the name of the disease this personal\\n      diagnosis of the patients mental and emotional reactions, his responses to\\n      changes in weather conditions, the alternations in his environment which\\n      influence his symptoms, etc., one realize how very individualistic is the\\n      Homoeopathic prescription fitted to that particular patient.\\n      \\n The homoeopathic physician does not\\n      seek for a remedy specific to any named disease and which he can thus\\n      apply almost automatically once he has made his organic diagnosis, which\\n      in quite an appreciable number of instances may ultimately be found to be\\n      wrong and so the treatment based upon it must therefore have been wrong.\\n      He does not, as is so often done, merely suppress the most outstanding\\n      symptom by an appropriate drug; for example giving an anodyne to mask the\\n      pain or removing the skin eruption by some strong local application, in\\n      other words putting the dust under the mat and pretending the room is\\n      clean.\\n      \\n Strangely enough the homoeopathic\\n      physician is often accused by his allopathic critic in his ignorance of\\n      Homoeopathy, of merely treating symptoms, whereas it is the critic himself\\n      who practices this superficial medicine. The homoeopathic physician, on\\n      the other hand, treats his patient as a whole through his symptoms and\\n      their modifications through changes in the environment, which is quite a\\n      different matter.\\n      \\n Homoeopathic therapy, unlike methods of\\n      treatment, is based on a natural law \"Similia Similibus\\n      Curentur\" \"Likes may be cured by likes\" which has been\\n      proved time and time again by experiment and which anyone with the will to\\n      do may prove for himself. It is not subject to constant change brought\\n      about by this or that latest discovery, and which itself will soon have to\\n      give way to the still later idea.\\n      \\n Having now introduced to you our actor,\\n      what of the scene in which he is to play his role?\\n      \\n This is the nineteen hundred and fifty\\n      - fourth year of the Christian era and the second year of the reign of our\\n      much loved and admired young Queen Elizabeth II, who will remember while\\n      in south Africa on her twenty - first birthday, before she had any idea\\n      that she would so soon be called to such an exalted position as she holds\\n      today, broadcast to the commonwealth and Empire her resolve to dedicate\\n      her life to the service of this grand community which dedication she\\n      recently repeated at her Coronation.\\n      \\n Here in Great Britain we have a more or\\n      less complete welfare state, with which idea some of us may very strongly\\n      disagree, whilst others believe such a development is the result of a\\n      natural very desirable social evolution.\\n      \\n As one necessary ingredient of this\\n      welfare state came, in 1948, the initiation of the National Health\\n      Service, through which the great majority of the population receives its\\n      medical attention, although it is rightly available to all.\\n      \\n When we come to consider the role that\\n      homoeo - therapeutics should play in this scheme, I would suggest that we\\n      should regard the problem from the purely medical aspect, forgetting any\\n      political party allegiances or sympathies we may have; or if we cannot\\n      forget them we should remember that the organization of the National\\n      Insurance Scheme of which the National Health Service is but a part, was\\n      first blue printed by the well - known Liberal supporter, Lord Beveridge,\\n      and the Health Service plans developed by the Coalition Government of all\\n      three major political parties.\\n      \\n We are living at present in an age\\n      which may very justifiably be regarded as a violent age in which have been\\n      developed so many appalling instruments of destruction, the use of some of\\n      which we are quite complacently accepting and from the use of others we\\n      are refraining, not because we consider them immoral, but simply through\\n      the fear of the wholesale destruction which would be caused by their use.\\n      We are seeing X-rays used in very high voltages in the treatment of\\n      cancer, we are being constantly remained of the use of dangerous drugs in\\n      medicine, without justification, in my opinion, bearing in mind the\\n      doubtful and evanescent ameliorations they produce and the violent\\n      surgical treatment of mental patients.\\n      \\n One further violence we should not\\n      forget is the way some of our foods are devitalized by the extraction of\\n      this or that portion of the natural product for purposes quite foreign to\\n      the well - being of the people who are to feed on them; or they are\\n      contaminated by the addition of this or that dangerous chemical, either\\n      during the growing of the plant, in the form of sprays, or as so called\\n      improvers in, for instance, the manufacture of white bread. It is very\\n      significant in this regard that quite a lot of attention is paid to the\\n      protection of the man who sprays the crops, but the right of the consumer\\n      to have uncontaminated food is slurred over by the unjustifiable statement\\n      that the amount of these chemicals so consumed is so small that it cannot\\n      have any bad effect on the consumer. We who practice Homoeopathy know how\\n      unwarranted is such a statement.\\n      \\n Can we homoeopathic physicians and\\n      patient hope to be able to do anything to make the still small voice of\\n      Homoeopathy heard in all this tumult, so that we may return to a saner and\\n      more healthful way of life and help our young Queen in her lifes work for\\n      the communitys sake?\\n      \\n Can we expect any help from the leaders\\n      of the medical profession? I am afraid not, because although I believe it\\n      accurate to state that there is a very slowly growing interest in, and\\n      tolerance of our work by individual doctors, the medical authorities are\\n      still, in their prejudice, strongly opposed to us. The London University\\n      still refuses to recognize our Hospital as a post - graduate teaching\\n      Hospital: the British Medical Association prohibits the formation of a\\n      homoeopathic section of its organization, and the Royal College of\\n      Physicians still refuses its membership to any one known as a homoeopathic\\n      physician. Yet in spite of this unfavourable environment, I firmly believe\\n      that there is a future for our method of therapeutics: but it will have to\\n      be pursued with courage, determination, foresight and energy. Surely if we\\n      believe as I do, that we are the guardians of a system of treatment\\n      destined to make our people healthier and therefore more efficient and\\n      happier, we would be failing in our duty to our country if we did not take\\n      every means in our power to acquaint the community at large with the\\n      advantages of this system and the dangers of ignoring it. This is a duty,\\n      not only of the profession, but also of the laity interested in\\n      Homoeopathy and who have experienced its benefits.\\n      \\n Every physician has two professional\\n      obligation to the community, that of preserving its health and that of\\n      endeavouring to restore it to being when it has fallen by the way.\\n      \\n The homoeopathic physician, thorough\\n      his knowledge acquired through the provings of drugs, even in\\n      infinitesimal doses, has, I believe, a very special responsibility as\\n      regards the prophylaxis of disease. It seems to me that a great deal of\\n      chronic ill health may quite conceivably be due to the manipulations of\\n      our foods and to the artificial manuring of the ground in which many of\\n      them are grown. Experiments have been carried our proving that plants\\n      grown in soil enriched by natural manuring, are much less prone to\\n      diseases than those grown with the help of artificial chemical manures. It\\n      seems a fairly justified conclusion that vegetables grown under these\\n      artificial conditions may quite well be deficient in something necessary\\n      for our perfect health. It is therefore incumbent upon the physician to\\n      advocate whenever possible the ingestion of healthily grown foods in the\\n      widest sense of that term.\\n      \\n The same duty applies when we consider\\n      the great amount of drugging in which the community at large indulges by\\n      its excessive smoking, particularly when aggravated by the practice of\\n      inhaling, and by the continued and prolonged use of drugs for this or that\\n      symptom, too often, unfortunately, though not always, on the prescription\\n      of their medical advisors.\\n      \\n There is a great lack throughout the\\n      community of any real enthusiasm for perfect health: we are only too prone\\n      to be content to follow like sheep, the unintelligent and harmful\\n      practices of the majority of our fellows.\\n      \\n Similarly in the curative realm, we\\n      homoeopathic physicians have special obligations.\\n      \\n When considering our position vis-a-vis\\n      the rest of the profession, we must never lose sight of the fact that our\\n      approach to the sick individual is a much broader and more comprehensive\\n      one than that of the dominant school. This latter prides itself on its\\n      scientific approach to its problems. One must, however, always be on ones\\n      guard against being hypnotized by that word scientific. The scientific\\n      aspect of any phenomenon or problem dealing with humanity is only one\\n      limited aspect of that problem. To get a complete picture one must\\n      consider other aspect, such as the aesthetic, emotional, maybe religious,\\n      and above all, perhaps one might say embracing all, the philosophical\\n      approach. This complex approach to his patients problem is the one that\\n      the homoeopathic physician always strives to adopt, and so never loses\\n      sight of the ego of the patient, while at the same time not forgetting his\\n      physical make - up.\\n      \\n Because this approach of ours to our\\n      patients is a much broader and more comprehensive one than the much\\n      vaunted scientific aspect, which the dominant school has come to regard as\\n      the Ultima Thule of medicine, I deplore the oft - repeated request of some\\n      of my colleagues that we should forsake our philosophy and make our work\\n      as scientific as theirs. I do not mean to imply by this that we should\\n      neglect the scientific angle of our patients illness but we should always\\n      remember that is only one facet of our problem. That is why we take such\\n      pains to diagnose our patients personality with his reaction to his\\n      environment in addition to the physical diagnosis of the case in order to\\n      arrive at our prescription for his malady. In other words, we should\\n      endeavour to lead our dominant school colleagues to our way of thinking,\\n      rather than that we should adopt theirs.\\n      \\n At the same time must always remember\\n      that if our philosophy should seem at any time to contradict so - called\\n      scientific laws, we must re - examine our philosophy, and if necessary\\n      modify it, while at the same time remembering that many times in the past\\n      what have been regarded as laws have ultimately been proved not to be so.\\n      Thus it is evident that we must never relax our self - examination.\\n      \\n What shall be the role of the\\n      homoeopathic laity?\\n      \\n The first thing for them to remember is\\n      that we are living in a democratic country whose government is dependent\\n      on the goodwill of the governed, and that, if a sufficient number of\\n      voters desire a certain line of action, that line will be adopted by the\\n      government.\\n      \\n The second thought is that there are\\n      not nearly sufficient doctors practising Homoeopathy in Great Britain to\\n      satisfy the present demand, let alone any further increased demand in the\\n      future, for this line of treatment.\\n      \\n Does not this seem strange, having\\n      regard to the great advantage to humanity that Homoeopathy provides? Not\\n      if one looks below the surface and so finds the reason for this shortage.\\n      \\n Surely the most potent reason is that\\n      Homoeopathy is not taught in the official Medical Schools, either as a pre\\n      - or post - graduate study. The London University when asked to recognize\\n      the Royal London Homoeopathic Hospital as a post - graduate Medical\\n      School, refused on the plea that as Homoeopathy was not taught in the\\n      undergraduate Medical Schools, it could not find a place for it in its\\n      post - graduate curriculum.\\n      \\n It is, of course, nonsense to suggest\\n      that a graduate should pursue his studies only in those subject of which\\n      he had already obtained some knowledge in his undergraduate days and\\n      should not wish to obtain information on any new or extra subject.\\n      \\n The University Medical Shools are\\n      enabled to a great extent through Government grants. We must therefore\\n      find some way of influencing whatever Government be in power to bring\\n      pressure to bear upon the London University to remove this obstacle to the\\n      better health of the community at large. I am quite satisfied that once\\n      this academic recognition is obtained we shave many more post - graduate\\n      students of Homoeopathy.\\n      \\n I believe than in a democratic\\n      community, having a universal State Medical Service, it is the bounden\\n      duty of the Government to remove all obstacles to the peoples obtaining\\n      that form of medical treatment in which they have confidence. So long as\\n      Homoeopathy is denied its legitimate status, so long must be Government be\\n      deemed to b failing in its duty to the country.\\n      \\n If, however, we are to achieve this\\n      desirable object of full recognition, we must all, professional and laity,\\n      be fired with enthusiasm, not only for the abstract cause of Homoeopathy,\\n      but for being partners with our young Queen in delicating our lives to the\\n      community.\\n      \\n When we do this we shall help to make\\n      this second Elizabethan era one to be remembered throughout the ages to\\n      come as surpassing the first Elizabethan era in that it gained not so much\\n      the economic and political leadership of the world - though that is not to\\n      be despised - but showed the way to the most healthful and spiritual way\\n      of life that all the world look notice and followed suit.\\n      \\n To sum up, the Role of Homoeopathy, as\\n      I see it, is to humanize the practice of medicine. By that I mean it must\\n      bring the practice of medicine into line with a reasoned philosophy of\\n      life, restore to it its artistry and rid it of all unnecessary hazards. It\\n      is to do this, not from any abstract academic sense of superiority, but in\\n      order the years to come are not those of merely another reign, but to\\n      ensure a veritable Renaissance, starting with the second Elizabethan era\\n      in which Great Britain will take its rightful place in the comity of\\n      nations as the pathfinder to a way of life for which posterity will be\\n      able to say \"Thank God for Queen Elizabeth the Second and her\\n      peoples.'\n",
      " 'Tresorie - Roentgenometric Pelvimetry [Roentgenometric Pelvimetry]\\n CHARLES W.PERKINS, M.D.\\n      \\n Norwalk, Conn\\n      \\n FOR some time the x-ray has been used\\n      to advantage in diagnosis of multiple pregnancy, position of fetus and\\n      fetal abnormalities. However, it has been only the past four or five years\\n      that any definite information has been obtained by roentgenographic\\n      methods of diagnoses in pelvimetry.\\n      \\n At the present time we are convinced\\n      that only by means of roentgenographs can be true proportions of the\\n      superior strait be determined, and that the ordinary external methods of\\n      Pelvimetry are not only occasionally misleading but proportionately\\n      inaccurate.\\n      \\n The present communication deals with\\n      the method of Herbert Thomas of Yale University. This method was developed\\n      in cooperation with the late Dr. W.A. Lafield, who was Professor of\\n      Roentgenology at the Yale Medical School.\\n      \\n Some of the reasons why roentgen\\n      pelvimetry has not been more universally adopted are probably due to the\\n      following factors.\\n      \\n (1) The majority of women will be\\n      delivered normally, whether or not pelvic measurements are made.\\n      \\n (2) The medical profession does not\\n      readily accept a new method after an established satisfactory routine has\\n      been in use.\\n      \\n (3) A new method of diagnosis incurs\\n      added expense.\\n      \\n (4) The present methods, although\\n      entirely speculative, are satisfactory in most cases.\\n      \\n (5) Roentgen pelvimetry cannot be\\n      performed by the obstetrician himself but requires the aid of a\\n      roentgenologist.\\n      \\n (6) The value of roentgenometric\\n      diagnosis is recent in origin and as yet not universally accepted.\\n      \\n If the knowledge of the size and shape\\n      of the pelvis is necessary to the practice of obstetrics, roentgen\\n      pelvimetry is a sound procedure, particularly in pre-emptors patients, and\\n      should and should be considered as an indispensable aid in these cases.\\n      \\n The method of Herbert Thoms as\\n      developed at Yale Medical School is not the only method. However, it can\\n      be classified as simple, accurate and rapid; being adaptable for use by\\n      other than experts in x-ray and obstetric diagnosis. As a technical\\n      procedure a well trained hospital technician can master its technic alter\\n      sufficient instruction.\\n      \\n Studies of recent years reveal the fact\\n      that external Pelvimetry fails to give uniform and accurate information in\\n      regard to the shape and size of the superior strait. This is often true of\\n      thin undersized individuals. In many patients of this type external\\n      measurements may suggest a contracted pelvis while the x-ray will show a\\n      relatively large pelvis with a subsequent natural labor and normal-sized\\n      child. On the other hand a stocky short person with similar external\\n      measurements will disclose a contracted pelvis which is an obstetric\\n      problem. Because of the apparent relationship between shortening of the\\n      transverse diameter and a secondary persistent occipito-posterior\\n      presentation, accurate information regarding this diameter is of clinical\\n      significance.\\n      \\n The observations of Thomas were made on\\n      twenty consecutive patients whose pelvis showed a relative or real\\n      shortening of the transverse diameter of the superior strait. In every\\n      instance a primary or secondary occipito posterior position was found\\n      after the patient was in labor. (Herbert Thoms, Surgery, Gynecology and\\n      Obstetrics, January, 1933). It therefore has been proved that an actual or\\n      relative shortening of a transverse diameter of the superior strait\\n      results in a limitation of space that is greater in the anterior than in\\n      the posterior half of the superior strait. Under these circumstances, when\\n      the head descends early in labor, the occiput is forced to rotate\\n      posteriorly.\\n      \\n The x-ray offers additional information\\n      in determining the size of the fetal head. It has been noted in x-ray\\n      examination of the unengaged fetal head that it lay with the transverse\\n      diameter of the superior strait, the occiput being either to the right or\\n      left; therefore, if roentgenogram of the patient is taken in the supine\\n      position with the fetus in the uterus, it will cast a shadow which is an\\n      enlarged profile of the head. The measurements of the occipital frontal\\n      diameter of the head can then be made. On numerous occasions this method\\n      of cephalometry, determining the diameter of the unmoulded head before and\\n      after cesarean section, has yielded accurate results. (Thomas, A.M.A.,\\n      February 24, 1934).\\n      \\n As experience increases in roentgen\\n      pelvimetry, the so-called labor test will be employed less. This, however,\\n      does not mean that the physician should not under estimate the importance\\n      of uterine contraction and the ability of the fetal head to mold. It has\\n      always followed that when something could be proved desirable in medicine\\n      for the better protection of the patient, such an advance would be\\n      demanded and eventually become routine. We may concede, therefore, that\\n      roentgen pelvimetry has a distinct place in the examination of every\\n      primiparous woman. In many instances, according to Thomas and others,\\n      external; measurements were normal but the x-ray examination revealed a\\n      contracted pelvis. On the other had, in certain patients whose external\\n      measurements suggested a cesarean section roentgen pelvimetry proved\\n      otherwise and they were subsequently delivered in a normal manner.\\n      \\n CENTIMETER GRID METHOD.\\n      \\n The procedure in this method may be\\n      summarized by stating the following:.\\n      \\n (1) The patient is placed on the\\n      roentgenographic table in the semi- recumbent position.\\n      \\n (2) The level of the superior strait\\n      above the sensitized film is established.\\n      \\n (3) The tube target is centered about\\n      five centimeters posterior to the symphysis, at thirty-two inches from the\\n      sensitized film, The exposure is made.\\n      \\n (4) The patient is removed from the\\n      table, the tube target and sensitized film remaining in situ.\\n      \\n (5) A lead plate, or centimeter grid,\\n      with perforations exactly one centimeter apart, is introduced into the\\n      same plane as that previously occupied by the superior strait and a second\\n      (flash) exposure is made on the same sensitized film as was used used in\\n      the previous exposure.\\n      \\n (6) Development of the film shows the\\n      outline of the superior strait and the shadows of the perforations, the\\n      assistance between which represents centimeters in the plane of the\\n      superior strait. The anteroposterior and transverse diameters of the\\n      superior strait in its use proportions may be drawn on centimeter-square\\n      paper by following the course of the shadow of the superior strait and\\n      transcribing it.\\n      \\n As this time I wish to express my\\n      thanks to Dr. Thoms for his personal advice and instruction which helped\\n      me to master the technic of his method.'\n",
      " 'Tresorie - NOTATU DIGNUM [Test Of A Homoeopath]\\n\\n Complaints are not unfrequently made\\n      that the homoeopathic materia medica is too vast for practical utility;\\n      that the schematised list of symptoms are unprofitable, if not impossible\\n      reading.

      " 'Tresorie - THE EFFICACY OF THE VIBROMETER IN APPLYING VIBRATORY MASSAGE\\nIN AURAL DISEASES [Efficacy Of Vibrometer In Applying Vibratory Message In Aural\\nDisease]\\n\\n SINCE presenting my paper before the\\n      American Institute, in June of last year on \"Vibratory Motion as a\\n      Method of Massage in Aural Diseases,\" I have been using an instrument\\n      specially devised for that purpose called the \"vibrometer.\" This\\n      instrument is in shape like a banjo, and has four strings stretched across\\n      its length resting on a bridge, which sets upon a diaphragm. On each side,\\n      elevated above the diaphragm and supported by posts, are two horizontal\\n      bars, which support the mechanical appliances used for producing the\\n      various vibratory motions. This consists in what is called a yoke, in\\n      which revolves a shaft connected with the electro-motor by pulley-wheels\\n      and a belt. Behind the diaphragm is a shallow air-tight compartment,\\n      leading from which are rubber tubes that are inserted in the external\\n      auditory canal during treatment, consequently any vibratory motion of the\\n      diaphragm, which must necessarily be an inward and a corresponding outward\\n      movement, would be exactly reproduced upon the membrana tympani, as the\\n      confined air, not being able to escape, will undergo an alternate\\n      condensation and rarefication in the external auditory canal.\\n      \\n Every vibratory movement of the strings\\n      of the instrument is communicated to the diaphragm by means of the bridge\\n      upon which it rests. These strings by varying their tension and length can\\n      be regulated to give a high or low rate of vibration as desired, for\\n      instance, the heaviest string left at its original length adjusted to a\\n      slight tension may make about fifty vibratory motions to the second, while\\n      the highest string on the instrument adjusted to a high tension and\\n      clamped down to one-fourth its original length would probably make three\\n      thousand vibratory motions to the second.\\n      \\n In the centre of the diaphragm is an\\n      attachment which works on a lever, and when hit by the cam on the\\n      revolving shaft lifts the diaphragm to a considerable extent, causing a\\n      powerful effect on the membrana tympani. This attachment can be adjusted\\n      at four different leverages, which causes a modification or increase of\\n      its intensity and can be regulated at from one to twenty-five vibratory\\n      movements to the second. This is only used in very bad cases and for not\\n      more than five minutes continuously.\\n      \\n The instrument which I have been\\n      describing in an improvement on the first manufactured, and as far as I\\n      know, is the only one which offers the same facilities for applying this\\n      method of massage. The class of patients in my experience who are\\n      generally benefited from the first, are those in which the mucous membrane\\n      lining the tympanic cavity and Eustachian tubes is in a hypertrophic\\n      condition. The membrana tympani are depressed, opaque, and thickened. They\\n      usually complain of a stiffed sensation in the ears, with a great deal of\\n      tinnitus aurium, and that their hearing is worse during a cold. In cases\\n      where the mucous membranes are atrophied with a large external auditory\\n      canal perfectly dry and Eustachian tubes patulous, and generally very\\n      little tinnitus, this or no other treatment has done very much good in the\\n      majority of cases, and in looking ever my records I find that only about\\n      five per cent. have been relieved, while in the before-mentioned cases the\\n      good results reach at least seventy-five per cent. In treating persons, I\\n      always select the rate of vibration which corresponds in pitch, if\\n      possible, to that caused by the diseased condition of the ears. If there\\n      is no tinnitus to guide me, I find whether the patient can hear a high or\\n      low sound better; if it is a low sound, a high rate of vibration is used\\n      in treatment, and vice versa, A point which I would like to explain here\\n      is this: It is not necessary that the sound from the instrument should be\\n      of the same quality of the tinnitus experienced by the patient, but merely\\n      the same pitch. for instance, if a banjo, where one of the strings was\\n      adjusted when sounded to produce a certain note, and a musical instrument\\n      of any other kind, whose quality of tone was entirely different, was made\\n      to sound the same note in a room, the string on the banjo would vibrate in\\n      sympathy, which has been proven by experiment, any other note, no matter\\n      how loud, would have no effect. Another point is in the way the strings of\\n      the vibrometer are set in motion. On the revolving shaft is a wheel\\n      projecting from which are metallic picks which hit the string it is\\n      adjusted over. It does not make any difference in the number of vibratory\\n      motions per second, whether the string is hit fast or slow, but at the\\n      time the string is first hit the intensity is greater than it is just\\n      before being hit again, and as the motion of the wheel is perfectly\\n      rhythmic, revolving so many times to the second, it has just as good an\\n      effect as if the intensity during the fraction of a second did not vary at\\n      all. The idea of using vibratory motion, as I have said before, originated\\n      within my mind some years ago, and later put into practical operation, and\\n      as far as I know, was the first to lay before the profession in a\\n      scientific manner, this method of massage.\\n      \\n I have found that when two of the\\n      strings upon the vibrometer were regulated in such a way that when both\\n      were set in vibration at the same time, producing the sensation of a\\n      harmonious sound, the effect in some cases on the tinnitus was especially\\n      beneficial, relieving, where the various kinds of vibrations produced by a\\n      single string failed. Sub-acute cases of deafness, accompanied by tinnitus\\n      aurium, are quickly relieved, as the following case will illustrate:.\\n      \\n Mrs. M. Young, married lady, aet. 26,\\n      called at my office, April 1, 1893, complaining of partial deafness and\\n      tinnitus aurium. She had a stuffed sensation, or as if cotton had been\\n      packed in the external auditory canal. She says the tinnitus was so\\n      annoying as to prevent sleep. On examination, found considerable\\n      retraction of the membrana tympani, and hearing for the watch, on the\\n      right side five inches, on the left, seven inches. The Eustachian tube\\n      were partially closed, which made inflation somewhat difficult, giving\\n      slight relief. I used several of the vibrations on the different strings\\n      without immediate benefit.\\n      \\n April 4th.-She came again, and reported\\n      that no improvement had taken place. I again inflated her ears, after\\n      which she sat down to the vibrometer. The central attachment was used with\\n      considerable force continuously for four minutes, after which she declared\\n      that the tinnitus had entirely ceased in the right ear, and greatly\\n      modified in the left; the hearing for the watch had increased for both\\n      ears to fourteen inches, and the stuffed sensation had almost entirely\\n      disappeared. On inspection of the membrana tympani, found them\\n      comparatively very slightly retracted. On April 8th, found improvement had\\n      continued, when the same treatment was used for three minutes; after which\\n      she declared herself completely relieved of the tinnitus and stuffed\\n      sensation, with hearing powerfully restored. Saw her again on April 13th,\\n      when she declared the good results from last treatment to have still\\n      continued.\\n      \\n I find that in the majority of cases,\\n      when the strings of the instrument are used it is only necessary to strike\\n      them lightly with the friction wheel. In vibrating the heavy string, I\\n      generally set the bridge back behind the central attachment, and adjusting\\n      the motor in such way that the belt is at a considerable tension, so that\\n      the pulley-wheel revolves slowly. I also generally use this adjustment\\n      when setting in motion two strings at one time. The principle of this\\n      method of treatment embraces two essential features which to my mind makes\\n      this system of massage the only scientific one applicable to the membrana\\n      tympani and its associate sound-conducting parts. Message is the\\n      application of motion to disease, and its scientific administration\\n      consists of its application in a systematic manner. In applying massage in\\n      aural diseases, it is necessary to produce a to-and-fro movement of the\\n      membrana tympani, and, if possible, by a force which is harmless and at\\n      the same time effective. The vibrometer fulfils these conditions. Any of\\n      the strings on the instrument that may be set in motion by the\\n      friction-wheel, will produce a certain number of vibratory movements to\\n      the second of time, and the movements of the central attachment are also\\n      measured. What could be more systematic than this? The motions of the\\n      membrana tympani were intended by nature to its vibratory, and as the\\n      vibrometer generates measured motion, and these motions are vibratory,\\n      theoretically we have a scientific and effective method of massage in\\n      aural diseases; and, as demonstrated practically by the use of the\\n      vibrometer, we have in fact a great scientific advance over all previous\\n      methods. Since the introduction of this treatment in aural diseases, it\\n      makes possible a more or less benefit in cases of deafness heretofore\\n      considered hopeless, and has opened up the field for the treatment of\\n      aural diseases to such an extent that the number of deaf patients seeking\\n      relief at the aurist\\'s hands will at least double itself.\\n      \\n DISCUSSION.\\n      \\n H.C. HOUGHTON, M.D.: Dr. Garey\\'s\\n      admirable paper gives us the description of the vibrometer, an instrument\\n      devised under his personal direction and inspection, for the purpose of\\n      applying massage to the ear. It is the only instrument of the kind on the\\n      market, so far as I am aware, and after a somewhat prolonged use of it, I\\n      am prepared to recommend the latest production of the vibrometer company.\\n      \\n This instrument is a decided\\n      improvement over the instrument first sent out, and is capable of\\n      producing a most profound effect upon the drum-head and ossicula; indeed,\\n      upon the entire auditory apparatus. I am able to confirm Dr. Garey\\'s\\n      statement of the effect of high and low vibrations us regards treatment.\\n      \\n I have also been very much interested\\n      in the use of stringed or reed instruments for diagnosis, and find that we\\n      can detect any abnormal sensitiveness of the auditory nerve to high or low\\n      tones. Some patients are extremely sensitive to all tones, high or low;\\n      others to high tones and not to low tones; others, conversely. Again, in\\n      some instances, there is a peculiar sensitiveness to single tones or to\\n      discords produced by sounding the note and half-note at the same time.\\n      Under the action of the central attachment of the vibrometer this\\n      sensitiveness is modified, the sensitiveness to high tones disappearing\\n      and being replaced by a low tone or, conversely, under treatment, a low\\n      tone disappears and a high tone is established, temporarily, at least.\\n      Again, in cases of recent origin, treatment will substitute an undefined\\n      rushing sound for a definite musical tone, either high or low, and later,\\n      the treatment will abolish this, the patient being relieved of this\\n      intensely annoying symptom. In some cases, with this relief, there is an\\n      improvement in the audition; in other cases, no improvement follows.\\n      \\n I confess to the domination of the\\n      material over my mind in my earlier experience with massage, and I think\\n      the inclination of operators will be to use a far greater degree of power\\n      than is necessary. I therefore notice with great satisfaction Professor\\n      Garey\\'s remark that \"the object should be to produce a to-and-fro\\n      motion to the membrana tympani, and, if possible, by a force which is\\n      harmless and at the same time effective.\" I would hardly say\\n      \"to-and-fro motion of the drum-head,\" because I think that the\\n      expression is liable to perpetuate the motion which is fixed in the minds\\n      of most physiologists, that the drum-head moves as a whole, with a\\n      to-and-fro motion.\" That is true under the influence of the Politzer,\\n      Siegle\\'s otoscope and similar instruments; but it certainly does not so\\n      move in the ordinary function of audition, but stands as the iris does in\\n      the eye, as an adjustor, a regulator of sound-force; in some sense as the\\n      iris does in its relation with the lens, to adjust, regulate and direct\\n      the essential force, and the vibration of the drum-head is at every node;\\n      every portion receives impressions that are converted into molecular\\n      disturbances of varying lengths, according as they are produced upon the\\n      stiff and unyielding portions of the drum-head at the periphery, along the\\n      manubrium, or in the more attenuated and easily-yielding portions which\\n      the between these two areas. Not only so, but these impulses are\\n      communicated to the contained air of the tympanum, and make their\\n      impression upon the acoustic nerve through the round window synchronously\\n      with the impression made through the ossicula.\\n      \\n This whole subject widens before my\\n      mind in such a way that one might wish himself twenty years and at liberty\\n      to devote himself to a term of research in acoustics, such as is offered\\n      only in the technical schools of the continent of Europe.\\n      \\n WM. R. KING, M.D.: In discussing Dr.\\n      Garey\\'s paper I shall begin by saying that his methods have been closely\\n      followed by me since the beginning of his experiments, owing to the fact\\n      that I have been greatly interested in the treatment of deafness and\\n      tinnitus by means of sound waves or by aural massage since 1887, and have\\n      experimented and treated many cases by this method since then, though with\\n      crude and unsatisfactory instruments. Since using the vibrometer-which,\\n      after much study and experimentation, is now presented to the profession\\n      in practical shape-I have undoubtedly increased my percentage of good\\n      results.\\n      \\n I don\\'t believe I am over-sanguine or\\n      carried away by interest in this method, and believe I can rightly\\n      appreciate that this does not offer us a panacea or cure-all for auditory\\n      ailments, and hope I may always be ready to see the failures and to strive\\n      to find methods or remedies to reach some of them.\\n      \\n In speaking of the application of the\\n      instrument, I wish to call attention to the central attachment or post foe\\n      vibrations. Dr. Garey has not given it as much attention in the paper as\\n      it deserves. It is very useful as a general means of aural massage,\\n      rougher in nature and more general in application than the strings which\\n      help to make up the instrument. I often use it before applying the\\n      \"similar found\" to a given case, as a species of gymnastics, to\\n      stimulate secretion and motion in the conducting apparatus of the ear,\\n      viz., membrana tympani and ossicles. In most cases-in fact, in all-where\\n      tinnitus is present, I follow this up immediately by the nearest approach\\n      to the similar pitch obtainable.\\n      \\n I agree thoroughly with Dr. Garey, that\\n      the best results are achieved in cases accompanying hypertrophic catarrh,\\n      and that the least benefit is apparent in cases of atrophic nature.\\n      \\n Regarding the method of treatment in\\n      the absence of tinnitus, my experience the does not coincide with that of\\n      the author of the paper entirely; I do not feel that as yet we have any\\n      safe rule to guide us. My method has been to try the numerous sounds and\\n      variations the of until I find the one that seems to give the best\\n      immediate results, or that the patient himself will speak of as very\\n      penetrating and powerful )though not necessarily loud and heavy).\\n      \\n It seems almost impossible at present\\n      to simulate all the qualities of tone as they occur in the ears of those\\n      suffering with tinnitus; in fact, it would appear to be unnecessary.\\n      However, it seems advantageous and quite necessary to secure the closest\\n      simulation of pitch, thus in many cases soon obliterating annoying\\n      tinnitus and improving hearing powers.\\n      \\n The arrangement permitting of the\\n      picking of two strings simultaneously adds decidedly the usefulness of the\\n      instrument, as it increases the range of pitch as well as varying the\\n      quality of tones procurable, thereby decidedly enlarging our field of\\n      application.\\n      \\n The force used for creating the message\\n      or gymnastics of the membrana tympani and the ossicles-viz, vibratory\\n      force or sound- carefully and scientifically applied, is nature\\'s remedy,\\n      because it is adapted by nature, and is the only force which can rightly\\n      or safely be applied to these delicate portions of this complex organ of\\n      hearing.\\n      \\n A startling commentary on this subject\\n      is the array of cases benefited who have been relegated to the shelf by\\n      ancient and modern otology; cases declared unhelpable have been vastly\\n      improved. Pray, make no mistake; I did not say all cases.\\n      \\n It may be interesting to hear the\\n      latest regarding the instrument which was first invented for the\\n      application of this method of aural massage Mr. E.J. Godman, the inventor\\n      and patentee, is constantly on the lookout, and always striving for\\n      improvements to his machine. He has made many that you all know of. Permit\\n      me to report a few so recent they have not yet left the factory.\\n      \\n First.-The machine has been taken from\\n      its case, and is now mounted on a solid stand or table of oak, being set\\n      below the level, or so that the face of the instrument is just level with\\n      the face of the table. This is all supported by rigid, solid metal legs,\\n      which absolutely prevent foreign vibrations.\\n      \\n Second.-The motor has been removed from\\n      its little shelf and relegated below the table. I t can be placed upon a\\n      box on the floor, a shelf against the wall, or, better yet, a shelf\\n      solidly attached to the metal supports of the table. A belt goes up\\n      through an aperture to a wheel on a shaft, the other extremity of which\\n      carries a wheel with a rubber tire (a friction wheel), which in its\\n      revolution, being in contact with a larger flat- surfaced wheel on the\\n      main shaft of the instrument, turns this in harmony with itself. This\\n      arrangement does away with the necessity of shifting the motor each time\\n      you wish to shift the carriage from one string to another- a consummation\\n      to be devoutly thankful for. The removal of the motor from the instrument\\n      as at present attached will recommend itself to all who have used the\\n      vibrometer, a great amount of undesirable jar being thus avoided.\\n      \\n Third.-Ratchet keys capable of very\\n      fine adjustment of tension of strings are now provided for the instrument.\\n      \\n Fourth.-A rheostadt or resistance-coil\\n      is now to be placed beneath the table between the storage battery and the\\n      switch, by this means enabling us to control the speed and number of\\n      revolutions to a nicety.\\n      \\n Other, though comparatively minor,\\n      improvements are being made, and others are contemplated, as, for\\n      instance, the substitution of a roughly corrugated rubber band for the\\n      picker on the wheel, thereby getting rid of the metallic sound of the\\n      picker on the wire strings.\\n      \\n I have experimented with a number of\\n      appliance for the production of the sounds and pitches that I have\\n      required, but I always fall back on the vibrometer, especially as at\\n      present constructed, for satisfactory work and results.\\n      \\n This instrument may be, and probably\\n      is, as yet, in its infancy. It, and the method it applies, can only be\\n      perfected by constant work and experimentation both on the part of the\\n      profession and of the manufacturers. Each improvement we can suggest, if\\n      it only should serve as a means of helping one solitary case, would be\\n      well worth our while.\\n      \\n The experiments being made by different\\n      methods for treating deafness by sound waves is indicative of the interest\\n      the profession has taken in the matter. It is indicative of a lack of\\n      something in our usual armamentarium which is greatly longed for by\\n      patient and doctor; that is, the means for making the deaf hear and for\\n      relieving distressing tinnitus. There has been a dearth in this direction,\\n      and perhaps there still is, but I believe fully that we have in aural\\n      massage by vibratory force a decided acquisition at our hands.\\n      \\n E. H. LINNELL., M.D.: I would simply\\n      like to ask Dr. King how long he uses the instrument, and whether he uses\\n      it according to the deafness.\\n      \\n DR. KING: Yes, decidedly. In an intense\\n      case of deafness I would have to use it a great deal longer. The central\\n      attachment I never carry over three or five minutes, and the whole\\n      treatment I don\\'t think is over carried over twenty or twenty-five minutes\\n      in one case, and usually averages from ten to fifteen.\\n      \\n HAROLD WILSON, M.D.: I have only to\\n      suggest, what I have elsewhere called attention to, the possibility of\\n      another mechanical device for securing vibratory motion. It is well known\\n      that in the make and break of a current of electricity, in the circuit of\\n      which there is a telephone, we get an influence upon the make and break of\\n      the current in the telephone. Now, it is a simple matter with which these\\n      makes and breaks are made as to obtaining any number of vibration that you\\n      wish. You may, by a mechanical device of some rotary motion, if you\\n      choose, make and break the current as rapidly as you please until you have\\n      reached several thousand vibrations a second, or you may even make the\\n      vibrations so slow us to be easily counted. The application of this\\n      suggestion has been put in force in my own practice, more or less, in the\\n      use of the telephone as connected with the induction-coil ordinary\\n      battery. The more intense the current, the more intense the sound. You can\\n      easily see that it is mere question of mechanics to secure these two\\n      sounds-intensity of vibration and rapidity of vibration. I will say,\\n      furthermore, that it has this advantage. There is no noise in the office,\\n      which I think is not altogether true of the vibrometer. I would suggest\\n      that so far as the vibrometer is concerned, if it could be made to be\\n      noiseless to anybody but the patient, it would be a decided improvement.\\n      In that respect the telephone is a decided improvement, because there is\\n      no noise except to the patient, because the noise is right at the ear of\\n      the patient. If I were seeking for a perfected instrument in this line, I\\n      would go outside of the banjo idea. As we have the most perfect writing\\n      machines, which have no connection with the ordinary method of writing,\\n      and sewing machines, which have no connection with sewing by hand, so it\\n      occurs to me that possibly the securing of he vibratory motion upon the\\n      ears might be obtained in a totally different way from that which you get\\n      when you listen to the drum of the guitar or an ordinary musical\\n      instrument, and I would suggest that the make and break of a telephone\\n      open a very fruitful field for mechanical experimentation.\\n      \\n H.C. HOUGHTON, M.D.: In my study of\\n      this subject I made the acquaintance of Mr. Bernhardt, of New York City,\\n      who is a personal friend of Mr. Emil Berliner, the inventor of the Emil\\n      Berliner Telephone, which is the instrument by which the Bell Telephone\\n      Company maintain their monopoly at present. Mr. Berliner is the inventor\\n      of the graphophone, and has, I think, covered this whole matter which Dr.\\n      Wilson has mentioned. As ordinary Bell telephone receiver is put into the\\n      circuit of an ordinary induction machine, and you can use it just as the\\n      English people use the audiometer, and as you remove the coil you modify\\n      the vibrations, which is covered with another disk and a tube, and that\\n      tube covered with a stethoscope tube, which is the same as we use for the\\n      phonograph or vibrometer, and, as Dr. Wilson has suggested, you can modify\\n      the intensity, and of course the whole matter is adjusted by the\\n      attachment of the cord, so that you can have fine vibrations. The\\n      intensity of the vibrations is regulated by the distance to which you\\n      uncover the cord. The only difficulty in the adjustment is that it has\\n      been so severe that it is really uncomfortable, and the noise of the\\n      instrument is reduced to the minimum for office use.\\n      \\n A.B. NORTON, M.D.: I will also add that\\n      in regard to the objection Dr. Wilson makes to the noise, there is no\\n      doubt it is an annoying thing in the office, and in that line I have some\\n      men at work on my suggestion. We are devising another machine, or\\n      instrument, which is to be entirely enclosed in a cabinet, so there will\\n      be no noise whatever in the room if it is made a success. The idea is a\\n      little crude, and I am quite uncertain whether it will amount to anything\\n      or not. Then, in the line of what Dr. King was speaking in regard to Mr.\\n      Goodwin-he called, at New York, to see me last week. I made two little\\n      suggestion to him, which I think would be in line with his advancement.\\n      One is the number of the picks. The present vibrometer has four picks I\\n      suggest the experiment of trying twelve or sixteen picks, which will make\\n      a more continuous sound; it may be of some value. Then, in regard to\\n      regulating the speed of the machine: you regulate that now by a series of\\n      buttons, so as to get three different speeds. We will have a very slight,\\n      intermediate speed, and a very rapid speed. My experience with the\\n      vibrometer is especially favorable. I think the idea is in the right\\n      direction, and it is simply a matter of instrumentation.']\n",

Dietary sources of vitamin C include fruits and vegetables, particularly citrus fruits such as oranges.Severe deficiency of vitamin C causes scurvy. Although rare, scurvy results in severe symptoms and can cause death. People with scurvy are treated with vitamin C and should be under medical supervision.Many uses for vitamin C have been proposed, but evidence of benefit in scientific studies is lacking. In particular, research on asthma, cancer, and diabetes remains inconclusive, and a lack of benefit has been found for the prevention of cataracts or heart disease.The use of vitamin C in the prevention or treatment of colds remains controversial. Extensive research has been conducted. Overall, vitamin C lacked an effect on the development of colds and on cold symptoms. However, the duration of the cold shortened slightly. Notably, people living in extreme circumstances, including soldiers in the subarctic, skiers, and marathon runners, had a 50% decrease in the risk of developing a cold. This area merits additional research and may be of particular interest to athletes or people in the military.'\n",

Acid in the stomach releases B12 from protein during digestion. Once released, B12 combines with a substance called intrinsic factor (IF) before it is absorbed into the bloodstream.The human body stores several years\\' worth of vitamin B12 in the liver, so low levels in the body are rare. Decreases in vitamin B12 levels are more common in the elderly, HIV-infected persons, and vegetarians.

First of all, radium and x-rays are no\\n      longer looked on a last resort.\".\\n      \\n The foregoing bears witness to the\\n      progress made in the field radiation therapy. The manufacture of more\\n      adequate apparatus and the improved technic in its use reflect this\\n      improvement. Machines are used generally delivering twenty to thirty\\n      milliamperes of current at 200 K.V., while machines operating at 750 to\\n      1,000 200 K.V., using lower milliamperes, have been installed in several\\n      places in this country. Since the question of increased voltages began to\\n      dominate the field, machines operating at 400 to 600 K.V., using sealed\\n      tubes, have been manufactured in this country as well as on the been\\n      manufactured in this country as well as on the continent. This higher\\n      powered machines occupy little more space than the usual 200 K.V. machine.\\n      \\n The effectiveness of these stronger\\n      radiations is thought to be due to (1) the increased penetration and its\\n      consequently larger percentage depth doses, (2) the supposed higher\\n      selective action of short have length radiation on malignant cells, and\\n      (3) greatly increased x-ray output. Clinics using super-voltages report\\n      that clinical results are somewhat better than those secured through the\\n      use of the lesser voltage machine.\\n      \\n Experimental effort, from the physical\\n      and biologic point of view, has been exerted to establish to standard\\n      basis for radiotherapy since Roentgens discovery thirtyfive years ago, and\\n      its application five years later. Radiotherapists have only recently begun\\n      to understand the principles of clinical application or radiotherapy in\\n      the treatment of malignant conditions.\\n      \\n Regaud selected the rabbits testicle\\n      for his experiments because its histologic cellular structure was highly\\n      sensitive to radiation, containing cells which are in a state of active\\n      mitosis resembling that of malignant tissue. In 1922, Regaud reported that\\n      of malignant, tissue. In 1922, Regaud reported that it was impossible to\\n      sterilize the testicle by a single dose of radiation without causing\\n      serious damage to the overlying skin. The dose required to produced such\\n      radio necrosis was equivalent to about three radionecrosis was equivalent\\n      to about three erythemas when administered in one dose. However, by\\n      dividing the dose in such a manner as to prolong the treatment over a\\n      period of fourteen days, a total dose of about five erythemas could be\\n      given causing complete sterilizations without damage to the skin. Thus it\\n      is seen that by prolonging the time of treatment the cutaneous dose could\\n      be increased nearly 50 per cent without causing necrosis.\\n      \\n The above experiments were reported,\\n      and the same results determined, by Schinz and Slotopolsky in 1926, and\\n      again by Regaud and Ferroux in 1927. These experiments formed the\\n      foundation for the clinical studies of Pfahler (America), Hohlfelder\\n      (Germany) and Coutard (France), who have swung the pendulum from massive\\n      radiation, as advocated by the German school, to that of the protected\\n      fractional dose method. Results have been achieved by this method which\\n      are superior to previously reported; these are obtained by the improved\\n      method of administering a large dose to the (3 days) without causing\\n      destructive effects to the surroundings normal structure (or cancer bed);\\n      its effect are rather biologic than physical. The clinical application of\\n      the method of radiation by Pfahler, Countard, and Berven (Sweden) in the\\n      treatment of cancer of the tonsil, pharynx and larynx and have proved the\\n      radio-sensitive properties of squamous carcinoma, previously considered\\n      incapable of of responding to radiation.\\n      \\n According to Coutard, the neoplasm is\\n      exposed to x-rays twice daily, giving a total dose of 350 r to400 r to two\\n      areas, using 190 to 200 k.v., four milliamperes, two millimeters of copper\\n      and three millimeters of aluminum filtration at a distance of fifty of\\n      sixty centimeters, for lesion of the head and neck. For deeply situated\\n      lesions, such as cancer of the uterus, the focal distance varies from 80\\n      to 100 centimeters, the area of the field for the head and neck conditions\\n      being only 50 to 100 square centimeters, while those of the lower abdomen\\n      require on an average of 250 to 300 square centimeters. For the\\n      sterilization of the radio-sensitive squamous carcinomatous growth, a\\n      depth dose of 3,000 r to 4,000 r is given, while stronger dose is\\n      necessary for the radio-resistant tumors.\\n      \\n In the course of treatment of principle\\n      guides a radio reaction of the covering epithelium and the radio reaction\\n      of the cancer cells. The radio reaction of the cutaneous epithelium is\\n      called \"radio epidermitis.\"characterized by loss of epithelial\\n      layers and denudation of the dermis. The reaction of the mucous membrane ,\\n      called \"radio epithelitis,\" manifests itself by loss of the\\n      epithelial layer sand denudation of the mucous membrane, epithelial layers\\n      and denudation of the corium which becomes covered by a fibrinous and\\n      false membrane; of clear. The duration of both describe radio reactions is\\n      six weeks. Each appears at the beginning of three weeks and disappears at\\n      the beginning of the ninth week.\\n      \\n Should the total or daily dose or the\\n      intensity per minute be too high, or the filtration or the tension too\\n      low, the cancer bed would be modified. the nutrition of the malignant\\n      cells becomes impaired The cellular radio- sensitivity, which seems to be\\n      linked up not only with the mitosis of the cell but above all with the\\n      activity of their interchange with the cell but above all with the\\n      activity of their interchange with the surrounding normal structures,\\n      becomes diminished and at times suppressed. The cancer cells become\\n      incentive to radiation. This phenomenon is called \"radio-\\n      vaccination\" by Regaud.\\n      \\n Observation of clinical facts shows\\n      that changes in the surrounding normal tissue result from excessive daily\\n      doses and intensity per minute per minute causing radio resistance of the\\n      tissue. Conversely, radio- sensitivity would be prolonged with a smaller\\n      daily dosage and the resultant extended period.\\n      \\n Realizing that better results may be\\n      obtained by prolonged treatment, Coutard and his collaborators in the last\\n      few years have begun to extend the duration of treatment of certain\\n      so-called radio-resistant cancers from thirty to ninety days, giving weak\\n      daily doses in order of about 175, 220, 225 and 250 r per day, dividing\\n      the dose in two treatments. By this method he was able to cure a certain\\n      number of lesions on which he had not been able previously to obtain the\\n      same results, such as very differentiated epidermoid epithelioma invading\\n      the muscles and cartilages, glandular epithelioma of the breast ad the\\n      thyroid body, and special round celled epitheliomas of the upper part of\\n      the ethmoid and the adjacent sinuses. This mode of prolonged treatment not\\n      only controlled the condition locally but it lessened the frequency of\\n      metastasis.\\n      \\n When radiating a cancer of very\\n      embryonic, very radio-sensitive growths, the energy factor is predominant.\\n      The action of the x-rays seems to be direct and rapid; the treatment can\\n      be accomplished within fifteen to twenty days. The cells are destroyed and\\n      generally normal structures are affected very little. When radiating the\\n      less embryonic type of growths, the time of treatment should be longer.\\n      \\n Pursuing these general principles, I\\n      have adopted the Countard method with some slight modifications. The cures\\n      which I shall illustrate will show that the percentage of cures in a\\n      number of most dangerous epidermoid carcinomas has markedly increased and\\n      that some conditions formerly considered hopeless have been temporarily\\n      cured. In conclusion I wish to emphasize the following facts:.\\n      \\n (1) Cure of cancer by x-rays is still\\n      difficult and must not be entered into lightly and causally.\\n      \\n (2) Radiotherapy is just as radical in\\n      method as surgery, and requires great skill, judgment and experience.\\n      \\n (3) The cooperation of the pathologist\\n      and the radiotherapist is imperative for a proper estimate of the\\n      radio-sensitivity in relation to treatment of the lesion.\\n      \\n (4) Daily examination of the patient is\\n      necessary; modification of the normal structure and general reaction by\\n      the x-ray treatment sometimes appears to quickly that it is often\\n      necessary to diminish the daily dose or the size of the field in the\\n      course of treatment.\\n      \\n (5) There exists no fixed method of\\n      treatment, only a simple clinical treatment for each individual patient\\n      and for the special type of tumor..\\n      \\n (6) Improvement in roentgen apparatus\\n      of higher voltages, producing more penetrating rays, will permit a better\\n      relation between destruction of malignant cells and preservation of the\\n      supporting, and the radio sensitivity of the tumor may be prolonged.'\n",
      " 'Tresorie - ALL INDIA HOMOEOPATHIC CONVENTION WELCOME ADDRESS [All India\\nHomoeopathic Convention Welcome Address]\\n\\n Mr. President, Friends and Colleagues.\\n      \\n It fills my heart with joy unspeakable\\n      to extend a hearty welcome to you all to this city at this All India\\n      Homoeopathic Convention held on the occasion of Bi-centennial Birth-day\\n      Anniversary of our great Master Hahnemann. This is the city where\\n      Homoeopathy was first introduced by Rajendra Lal Dutta of hallowed memory,\\n      who spent a princely fortune for dissemination of its principles and\\n      practice among his countrymen. This is the city where took place the\\n      dramatic conversion of one of the then medical luminaries of the first\\n      magnitude, to the practice of Homoeopathy under the influence of Rajendra\\n      Lal. I mean Dr. Mahendra Lal Sircar who became the high priest of\\n      Homoeopathy, spread its glory far and wide and gained thereby an\\n      international reputation for himself. This is the city where the\\n      celebrities of Homoeopathy like Dr. Berigny, Dr. Salzar, Dr. P.C.\\n      Majumdar, Dr. D. N. Roy. Dr. Younan, Dr. J.N. Majumdar, Dr. Baridbaran\\n      Mukherji, Dr. S.K. Nag, Dr. A.N. Mukherji, Dr. T.N. Palit, Dr. G.\\n      Dirghangi and a host of other talented physicians practised their\\n      profession with credit and success and held aloft the banner of\\n      Homoeopathy. This is the city where exist pioneer institutions for the\\n      teaching of Homoeopathy. This is the city wherefrom Homoeopathy has spread\\n      to all parts of India and its votaries are doing yeomans service for the\\n      good of the suffering humanity.\\n      \\n We are meeting this evening on a\\n      historic occasion and we have to arrive at decisions which might make or\\n      mar the future history of Homoeopathy in India. It may be that forces of\\n      disruption, destruction and obstruction are at work; it may be that self\\n      and vested interests seem to thwart the smooth progress of Homoeopathy; it\\n      may be that some may seem to play in the hands of the Powers that are not\\n      too sympathetic to the cause of Homoeopathy; it may be that the present\\n      seems to be chaotic and future of Homoeopathy dubious but great is truth\\n      indeed and will prevail. We should not lose heart or throw up the sponge.\\n      Tradition, authority, sectarianism, dogmatism are great obstacles on the\\n      way. But obstacles and difficulties are meant to be fought out and\\n      overcome. Strifes and dissensions, discords and disunities may hamper our\\n      progress but they are nonetheless signs of lifes activities. It is a good\\n      augury that the Homoeopathic profession is shaking off its age - long\\n      slumber and getting more and more conscious of its duties and obligation,\\n      its rights and privileges and of its short - comings and practical\\n      difficulties. The life of Hahnemann is there to encourage us; the\\n      masterful will of his dynamic spirit is there to inspire us to intensify\\n      our activities; his achievements are there to goad us to realise greater\\n      success; and his personality is always before us to take lessons from, in\\n      our life which as Swami Vivekananda puts it, is \"a process of\\n      unfolding and development of a being under circumstances tending to press\\n      it down.\"\\n      \\n That Homoeopathy is a scientific system\\n      of treatment, philosophically sound, logically unimpeachable, practically\\n      highly efficacious in curing the sick and cheap enough to suit the poor\\n      economic condition of the Indian masses - has become a much talked - of\\n      subject in the country. But why is it not spreading sufficiently and\\n      adequately in our motherland or in fact anywhere in the world? Why is our\\n      National Government not still keen on according official recognition to\\n      this superb system of healing art or providing ways and means for its\\n      development and diffusion? Why the public opinion is not gaining strength\\n      enough to put sufficient pressure on our Government to take interest in\\n      it? Why sufficient number of fully equipped Homoeopathic teaching\\n      institutions and hospitals are not growing to turn out adequate number of\\n      fully qualified Homoeopathic physicians in the country?\\n      \\n It is high time that we should draw the\\n      attention of the profession and the laity to provide answers to so many\\n      \"whys\" and to solve the pressing problems in the matter\\n      concerned. On a cursory view it becomes evident that the Homoeopathic\\n      profession, the people and the Government are each individually and\\n      collectively responsible for this impasse.\\n      \\n The so - called Allopathy still\\n      occupies the dominant place in any country, even in the land of birth of\\n      Homoeopathy. It is no wonder that Homoeopathy, being a discovery of merely\\n      a century and a half still lags behind its rival shool. But it is a wonder\\n      of wonders that Homoeopathy has already encompassed the whole world within\\n      such a short period since it was ushered into existence by Hahnemann.\\n      History of man reveals that nowhere a new truth was accepted by him easily\\n      and readily, obsessed as he is with conservatism, tradition, authority and\\n      vested interests. Nonetheless the triumphant march of Homoeopathy with a\\n      such a meteoric speed throughout the length and breadth of the world is a\\n      proof positive of the truth inherent in the system and phenomenal\\n      therapeutic efficacy of this healing art. It is one more glaring instance\\n      of mans love of truth against heavy odds that impede his progress at every\\n      step.\\n      \\n For the propagation of any new truth\\n      and its acceptance by man, in general, the first and foremost condition is\\n      the turning out of sufficient number of persons who have realised the\\n      truth and are adept in the practice of it. This involves establishment of\\n      a sufficient number of teaching institutions which will turn out experts\\n      in the science and art of Homoeopathy; and a sufficient number of\\n      Homoeopathic Hospital where, the efficacy of this system of treatment will\\n      be put to test.\\n      \\n Human knowledge is becoming\\n      unmanageably vast. The appearance of specialists has become indispensable.\\n      So special Hospitals for the treatment of specific types of diseases have\\n      sprung forth elsewhere, e.g. Tuberculosis Hospitals, Cancer Hospitals,\\n      Hospital for Tropical Diseases etc. Because of organisation of these\\n      hospitals people generally think of getting themselves treated in these\\n      institutions. As there are no fully - equipped general Homoeopathic\\n      Hospitals and not to speak of special Homoeopathic Hospitals and not to\\n      speak of special Homoeopathic Hospitals the result is Homoeopathy is not\\n      getting a fair chance of treating those diseases like tuberculosis,\\n      cancer, acute infectious diseases of epidemic type e.g., Small-pox,\\n      Cholera etc. on a large and organised scale. Consequently the general\\n      public cannot keep much faith in this treatment and mostly take recourse\\n      to homoeopathic treatment when the case is \"past all hope and past\\n      all surgery\". Hence the establishment of fully - equipped\\n      Homoeopathic institutions (College - cum - Hospitals) is an imperative\\n      necessity for enhancing the prestige of the Homoeopathic profession and\\n      for convincing the people about the therapeutic efficacy of this system of\\n      treatment. Is it not a pity that Homoeopathy once established its\\n      reputation by treating Cholera cases in this city and now nobody thinks of\\n      this treatment in Cholera cases and rushes the patient to the Allopathic\\n      Hospitals which are especially meant for these types of patients? How can\\n      we hope to gain ground under these circumstances?\\n      \\n The next great obstacle is the apathy\\n      and in many cases active antagonism of our Government, both at the Centre\\n      and at least in some of the State, towards Homoeopathy. The Government is\\n      under the thumb of its medical directorates which are solely manned by\\n      Allopathic doctors. The main reasons for the non - acceptance of the\\n      Homoeopathic system of treatment may be summed up in three words:\\n      tradition, authority and professionalism. Their psychology is easily\\n      understood if it is borne in mind that the conservative inertia of human\\n      mind attempts to reject any new thought will all the means at its\\n      disposal. Another reason is due to vested interests. Even a cursory glance\\n      at the history of origin and spread of Homoeopathy, enables one to find\\n      out that the opposition to this system from the start, was not scientific\\n      but rather of commercial nature on the part of the apothecaries who were\\n      afraid of losing their trade - profits. We regret to note that the Central\\n      Government have not yet implemented a single recommendation put forward by\\n      the Homoeopathic Enquiry Committee, Planning Commission. Third Health\\n      Ministers Conference, Ad Hoc Committee etc. though Homoeopathic Acts have\\n      been passed in the States of Bombay, U.P., Madhya Pradesh, Travancore -\\n      Cochin, Bihar etc. I is curious to note that W. Bengal is the only State\\n      where a Homoeopathic Bill has recently been thrown out by the State\\n      Government.\\n      \\n Another great obstacle is the\\n      psychology of the general mass of population who fail to adopt a proper\\n      philosophical attitude towards Homoeopathy and takes the Homoeopathic\\n      Therapeutic Law as great paradox contrary to common sense. Unless we can\\n      educate the public in the matter, we cannot hope to secure their whole -\\n      hearted support for this system of treatment.\\n      \\n Lack of enthusiasm for constructive\\n      works on the part of the Homoeopathic profession, the apathy of our\\n      Government and hesitancy on the part of the public to accept Homoeopathy\\n      are great obstacles to the spread of this system of treatment in the\\n      country. Unless this vicious circles is broken the progress of Homoeopathy\\n      is bound to be impeded. We have to fight on all fronts if we aspire to\\n      achieve victory in our battle for the cause of Homoeopathy and the\\n      suffering humanity.\\n      \\n But our first necessity as pointed out\\n      by the Soul of India expressing itself through Sri Aurobindo, is: If India\\n      is to survive and do her appointed work in the world, the youth of India\\n      should learn to think, to think on all subjects, to think independently,\\n      fruitfully, going to the heart of things, not stopped by their surface,\\n      free of pre - judgements, shearing sophism and prejudice asunder as with a\\n      sharp sword smiting down obscurantism of all kinds as with a mace of\\n      Bhima.\\n      \\n \"Let our brains no longer, like\\n      European infants, be swathed with swaddling clothes; let it have recover\\n      the free and unbound motion of the Gods, let it have not only the\\n      minuteness but the wide mastery and sovereignty natural to the intellect\\n      of Bharata and easily recoverable by it if it once accustomes itself to\\n      feel its own power and be convinced of its own worth.\\n      \\n \"The old fixed foundations have\\n      been broken up, we are tossing in the waters of a great upheaval and\\n      change. It is no use clinging to the old ice - floes of the past, they\\n      will soon melt and leave their refugees struggling in perilous waters. It\\n      is no use landing ourselves in the infirm bog, neither sea nor good, dry\\n      land of a second - hand Europeanism. We shall only die there a miserable\\n      and unclean death.\\n      \\n \"No we must learn to swim and use\\n      that power to reach the good vessel of unchanging truth; we must land\\n      again on the eternal rock of ages.\"\\n      \\n Yes, we must expand, we must assimilate\\n      whatever is assimilable for our growth. Stagnation and contraction are the\\n      signs of Death. Our knowledge must be aggressive, must diffuse through the\\n      rank and file of the whole Homoeopathic profession if we wish to survive\\n      and perpetuate ourselves; to leave an extensive ignorance either below or\\n      around us is to expose ourselves to the perpetual danger of being\\n      exterminated as a professional entity.\\n      \\n In fine, I welcome you, once again, on\\n      this historic occasion to this historic city to deliberate, to exchange\\n      view points and to come to agreed decisions with regard to our future line\\n      of action in respect of Homoeopathy in all its aspects.'\n",
      " 'Tresorie - SOME OBSERVATIONS ON NEURASTHENIA AND ITS TREATMENT\\n[Neurasthenia & Treatment]\\n\\n WHEN, thirty-five years ago, the writer\\n      first made the acquaintance of what is now called neurasthenia, it was\\n      known as spinal irritation, and the best of modern researches have been\\n      unable to give a better definition beyond a functional disturbance of the\\n      spinal and cerebral nerves, dependent on a morbid process, for which\\n      \"irritation\" is as proper a term as any. As deaths do not occur,\\n      autopsies throw no light on the subject. Briefly stated, neurasthenia,\\n      when observed from the beginning through its chronic course, has a period\\n      of prodromal symptoms followed by a protracted acute, and succeeded by a\\n      still more protracted chronic, state, between the end of which and the\\n      beginning of convalescence there is a very vague, often indiscernible,\\n      boundary line.\\n      \\n The prodromal symptoms are quite\\n      indefinite and very variable, pointing to nothing in particular. Loss of\\n      appetite, irregular sleep, excitability alternating with lassitude, etc.,\\n      are often overlooked, especially when the second stage-display of unusual\\n      mental and physical energy without subsequent fatigue- becomes apparent.\\n      This is often mistaken for a sign of unusually good health. When a young\\n      girl or mature woman, married or unmarried, feels that she can study ten\\n      hours a day and devote half of her night to pleasure or business; when\\n      besides much mental occupation she begins to rejoice in long walks without\\n      fatigue, that is the time when the mischief is going on without exciting\\n      timely suspicion. Relief is at last sought when the functional disorder of\\n      the nerves has gone to the opposite extreme, and becomes manifest in what\\n      is properly and popularly termed \"nervous prostration,\" when\\n      instead of having no sense of fatigue, the best bodily or mental effort\\n      seems intolerable, in grave cases rendering the patient a helpless being,\\n      completely dependent on the unremitting assistance of others whom she )it\\n      is usually a woman) rules with the inexorable power of the vis inertiae.\\n      \\n During this usually very protracted\\n      period of the disease convalescence usually sets in, but so imperceptibly\\n      that the physician alone can sometimes estimate its progress, which is\\n      unnoticeable to others towards whom the patient acts as she has for months\\n      or years. This is the time for action, too often delayed from motives of\\n      misplaced sympathy on the part of relatives and friends.\\n      \\n The affections is in many instances\\n      limited to the spine, the mind becoming only secondarily tired. In other\\n      cases it is spinal and cerebral; in others again chiefly cerebral. The\\n      line between this and insanity is always clearly definable. Though a\\n      neurasthenic patient may become insane, and probably the reverse, yet both\\n      are distinct conditions.\\n      \\n Books speak of this disease at common\\n      to men and women. Yet in this region in small towns as well as in large\\n      cities the cases of neurasthenia in women are preponderatingly great.\\n      \\n Hypochondriacs and hysteria stand in\\n      peculiar relation to neurasthenia. They maybe regarded as different\\n      species of the same genus; that is, more or less deeply seated\\n      disturbances of the cerebro-spinal system in which the sympathetic system\\n      is probably indirectly involved, as many functional disturbances presided\\n      over by the great sympathetic system often testify. Hypochondriasis, pure\\n      and simple as occurring in men, is easily distinguishable by its striking\\n      characteristic of introspection and despondency, occasioned by abnormal\\n      sensations, without marked physical weakness and tiredness. Pure\\n      hypochondriacs are often energetic, conscientious workers. In hysteria\\n      there is neither great tiredness nor tendency to introspection, but a\\n      paroxysmal or prolonged absence of the power of self control, in grave\\n      cases associated with tonic or clonic muscular spasm and loss of\\n      consciousness. While neurasthenia in its uncomplicated forms is free from\\n      these symptoms, but, as ample experience teaches, often complicated with\\n      both of the preceding forms to such an extent that it is often very\\n      difficult to tell which is primary and which secondary. The symptoms known\\n      as introspection, hysterical aberrations of the emotions, and neurasthenic\\n      sense of exhaustion are in their distinctive manifestations most important\\n      and constitute indications in the selection of remedial and dietetic\\n      measures.\\n      \\n The following are some observation of\\n      peculiarities observed in a large number of cases and peculiar to all:.\\n      \\n Introspection.-The neurasthenic patient\\n      in variably expresses her desire for relief, not so much in a direct\\n      appeal as in a supplicating, subdued tone of voice and manner. She rarely\\n      asks, \"What can you do to relieve me?\" but almost invariably,\\n      \"What is the cause of\" this or that sensation? If she is\\n      introspective, that is, hypochondriacal, she becomes a nosomaniac,\\n      watching acutely every one of her numerous distressing sensation, on the\\n      unremitting analysis of which her mind dwells. In marked cases she is\\n      quite unable to think of anything outside of herself, and in many cases\\n      dislikes to do so, preferring to river her attention on herself. Attempts\\n      to divert her annoy or anger her. Friends and relatives implore the\\n      physician to divert the patient, but all their attempts are in vain\\n      because quite misdirected.\\n      \\n Positive and Negative Will.-It seems\\n      sometimes as if the patient delights in her self-inspection, and that she\\n      prefers her condition to speedy recovery. This is not the case, for the\\n      patient will always assure the physician of her wish to get well. During\\n      the acute stage-a long yet definable period-this wish and longing cannot\\n      well be utilized, but the long and ill-defined period of convalescence\\n      must first be awaited. Here we shall always discover that the wish and the\\n      will of the patient are two very different mental conditions. The desire\\n      or wish for recovery is entirely unattended by any will effort to\\n      accomplish the desired end. The injunctions and directions of the\\n      physician are resisted by the same unconquerable power of negative power,\\n      or vis inertiae. The patient having been unable to exert her will, now\\n      thinks herself unable to use it.\\n      \\n Numerous Symptoms of Patients.-To\\n      physicians in search of indications for medicines each statement of\\n      patient concerning a sensation is apt to be considered as a symptom. Many\\n      years ago, when resolved to get at the keynote of a patient\\'s case, the\\n      writer determined to allow the patient to detail all her symptoms as long\\n      as she chose and to take accurate notes of each one till the right one\\n      should be disclosed; and this was to be done regardless of time and\\n      exertion. The patient, one who needed no urging to describe her\\n      \"symptoms,\" began in an almost inaudible voice, detailing one\\n      sensation after another with an unrivalled degree of clearness and\\n      vividness of expression; as she proceeded the voice became stronger, her\\n      face slightly flushed, and the most perfect descriptive language flowed in\\n      an endless stream. Each word was written down, page after page was filled;\\n      still she went on with unmistakable signs of satisfaction at being able to\\n      pour her pent-up emotions into willing and sympathetic ears. If, for a\\n      moment, the flow of language was interrupted, a simple question would\\n      re-animate her to proceed with renewed energy. Feelings seemed to beget\\n      feelings; their complexity gave the patient no trouble; her intellect was\\n      equal to the action of unraveling the most complicated sensation,\\n      separating them into their component parts and spreading them out before\\n      the mind of the listener. A glance at the watch showed that nearly two\\n      hours had passed, during which the feeblest of neurasthenic patients had\\n      talked incessantly. The note-book was full, the keynote was found. It was\\n      this: neurasthenic patients have innumerable sensation and exhibit no\\n      sings of fatigue after talking incessantly for nearly two hours.\\n      \\n Great Endurance of Neurasthenics.-The\\n      instance just related, which is one of many, illustrates two things. One\\n      is, that it is not the kind of sensation described but the fact that\\n      neurasthenics have innumerable sensations, that constitute the symptoms.\\n      The other thing is that many neurasthenics are capable of great exertion\\n      without suffering disagreeable after- effects from fatigue. This is\\n      illustrated by other cases of which I have notes. A highly neurasthenic\\n      young lady consented to camp out for her health near a lake. She was\\n      induced to join a party for a short walk along the lake. By trying what\\n      they thought a shorter road the party lost their way and took a very long\\n      walk of about four hours, through bogs and over forces. The neurasthenic\\n      was less fatigued than some of the others. The interesting observation was\\n      subsequently made that the patient had become interested in a young man of\\n      the party. She recovered her health within a year from that time. Other\\n      cases of this kind will appear under the head of therapeutic suggestions.\\n      \\n Neurasthenic Patients Crave\\n      Sympathy.-This is one of the most formidable obstacles to the curative\\n      management of such cases, for the kind of sympathy such patients crave is\\n      expressions of condolence and more or less deep affliction at so much\\n      suffering as the patient expresses. Such sympathy is most natural and does\\n      honor to the feelings of parents, sisters, brothers and husbands, but it\\n      is unfortunate that the deeper their expression of affliction so much the\\n      more profound will be the mental dejection and weakness of the patient.\\n      Almost every case which has come under the writer\\'s observation has been\\n      much hampered if not made hopeless by this condition of things, against\\n      which no remedy suggests itself that would not be construed as\\n      \"unkind\".\\n      \\n The origin of this very formidable and\\n      refractory nervous disease, like that of most diseases usually termed\\n      chronic, is either hereditary or acquired, as the histories of every\\n      observed case plainly testify. Either the father was a hypochondriac or\\n      the mother neurasthenic, or both parents were of unsound nervous\\n      constitution. Dipsomania on the part of parents produces neurasthenia in\\n      the children, as readily as it will be followed by any other form of\\n      nervous disease, according to the individual predisposition of the\\n      offspring. The excessive use of tea and coffee is another very active\\n      factor in the history of neurasthenics. Where fathers inclined to alcohol,\\n      mothers are addicted to tea and coffee, which, while its immediate effects\\n      do not obtrude themselves upon our notice, are none the less insidious in\\n      their more remote consequences.\\n      \\n The acquired forms of neurasthenia are\\n      of utmost interest to the therapeutist, and the sources of acquisition are\\n      readily stated. They are much brain-work with insufficient food and sleep.\\n      Such conditions obtain chiefly in women (less frequently in men) of fine\\n      intellectual ability, conscientiousness and ambition. Physical overwork\\n      with unintellectual women has no such effect. Quite analogous to the above\\n      are the conditions of care and sorrow, especially in women who are able\\n      for a long time to conceal and control their emotions. The usual\\n      consequence of such states of mind is disregard of food and insufficient\\n      sleep. Instances of acquired neurasthenia are presented in families of\\n      several girls and boys, where one or more of the former are Neurasthenic\\n      while the latter are vigorous and athletic. Boys delighting in vigorous\\n      exercise do not, as is the case with girls, lose appetite and sleep.\\n      \\n The effects of nervous exhaustion in\\n      boys are usually much less grave than in girls; as a rule such effects are\\n      manifested in mental, not muscular, tiredness, and they are relieved by\\n      air and exercise, while in girls and women those influences are shunned\\n      because they seem to increase the tiredness.\\n      \\n Predisposition-The temperament, or what\\n      in modern pharaseology is called the personal equation, plays a visible\\n      but uncontrollable part in the progress of neurasthenia, as temperament\\n      greatly determines the other imperfectly known condition known as\\n      predisposition. Where the disease is hereditary, it is easy to say that\\n      the predisposition is due to that source; where there is no history of\\n      heredity and where neurasthenia exists in the last members of a\\n      generation, it may be attributed to acquired predisposition which needed\\n      only the exciting cause to establish the disease in its most typical form.\\n      \\n One of the most common forms of\\n      neurasthenia, often quite intractable, results from a serious defect in\\n      our public school system, one which affects chiefly girls from twelve to\\n      fourteen years of age. The following is a brief example: The child rises\\n      late with no appetite for breakfast and no time to eat it if so inclined.\\n      The lessons, however, have been learned the evening before, and the school\\n      work is begun with an ambitions will and a crammed mind, and continues\\n      with one intermission of often not more than ten minutes or three of four\\n      hours. The pupil arrives at home ravenously hungry, eats too fast, and too\\n      much of injudiciously prepared food, too long in digesting to leave room\\n      for an appetite for even a light evening meal, or even for a breakfast the\\n      next morning.\\n      \\n In another case the girl or boy grows\\n      desperately hungry while at school, but being unprovided with food\\n      (lunch), goes on with the school exercises, at the end of which the sense\\n      of hunger has vanished and has been replaced by an aversion to normal\\n      food, with a possible craving for something pungent and indigestible. This\\n      observation can easily be made in many instances, and will, in as many\\n      cases, be seen to lead to nervous prostration, which is then treated by\\n      vile, patented concoctions consisting largely of whiskey, under the name\\n      of \"tonics,\" while the patient needs only the best that a\\n      legitimate market affords prepared in a sensible manner.\\n      \\n Typical Cases Ending in Rapid\\n      Recovery.-Curative results have already been indicated in what has been\\n      said above, and further indications for treatment may be gathered from a\\n      few cases of extremely rapid recovery of apparently incurable cases, to\\n      which brief allusion will here be made. A woman of forty had been a victim\\n      of grave neurasthenia for five years. In the absence of an inclination to\\n      exert himself, she had, during that period, been mostly confined to her\\n      bed or lounge, in the meantime giving birth to two children, going through\\n      gestation and confinement normally, without recovering from neurasthenic\\n      prostration which, in the course of some years more, rendered her entirely\\n      helpless. Her condition was associated with a feeling of dropping to\\n      pieces unless supported and braced by a harness of wood, iron and leather,\\n      in which she \"sat up\" for several hours each day, spending the\\n      rest of the time in bed. Having left the patient in this condition, it was\\n      reported before the writer\\'s next professional visit that Mrs.-had been\\n      cured, and that she was able to go out like other people. A visit to the\\n      house confirmed the report. The patient came to the door herself, and in a\\n      quiet manner, entirely without the least expression of joy or wonder at\\n      her release, stated, that having heard of a famous \"magnetic\\n      physician,\" she summoned him, was ordered by him to arise and stand;\\n      protesting that it was impossible, she was raised to her feet and again\\n      ordered to stand, then to walk. Fearing that she would fall, she begged\\n      the magnetic doctor to support her, which he peremptorily refused, saying\\n      she might fall if she liked. Instead of falling, she had to walk about the\\n      room, was then placed upon a lounge and subjected to a severe treatment of\\n      rolling and pummelling, and then ordered to dress and sit up until tired,\\n      to remain up and about like other people, and to call on the doctor in\\n      future, as he would not come so far to the patient again. This happened\\n      about twenty-five years ago, and the patient has been in very fair health\\n      arrested by insisting that all professional visits by the writer or any\\n      other physician to whose sympathy the patient could appeal must cease.\\n      This injunction was carried out conscientiously with the best results by\\n      the husband of the patient. Perhaps we may learn from this that sometimes,\\n      at least, the familiar motto is reversed, and angels rush in where fools\\n      fear to tread.\\n      \\n Profiting by this experience, another\\n      neurasthenic woman, unmarried, but of most intractable, antagonistic\\n      temperament, confined to her bed, in and out of hospitals, for years,\\n      wearing out the strength and means of her relatives and the patience of\\n      many physicians, was at length abandoned by them. It was a case of spinal\\n      and cerebral neurasthenia complicated with hypochondriasis in its most\\n      trying form of introspective maunderings and endless description of\\n      symptoms. She tormented her advisers by her endless tirades, the\\n      indulgence of which invariably aggravated her condition, and were there\\n      fore avoided, until once her physician yielded to the patient\\'s\\n      importunities for a visit, when be found her in her usual abject state of\\n      prostration. Guided by experience derived from cases like the one first\\n      described, he assisted the patient to her feet and marched her, will you\\n      nil you, up and down the room until he, at least, was thoroughly tired,\\n      and then departed with the promise never to do so again. The patient, on\\n      her part, made a number of her unnameable promises, but kept on her feet\\n      and let the doctors alone. Though not cured of deeply-rooted morbid mental\\n      faults, the neurasthenic phase of her condition had yielded to the change\\n      of the antagonistic element of her character from passive to very\\n      practical activity. A third very serious case of this kind occurred in the\\n      person of a girl of fifteen, of selfish character, who gradually became\\n      bed-ridden with spinal and cerebral neurasthenia, and tormented with the\\n      usual multifarious painful sensations, none of which, on the most\\n      pains-taking physical examination, resulted from demonstrable organic\\n      disease of genital or abdominal organs. The patient was most tenderly\\n      cared for by her mother, who, in the course of years, became so imbued\\n      with the idea of yielding to every wish and whim of the patient, that at\\n      length remonstrance became useless. The mother, though recognizing the\\n      importance of persuading or urging her daughter to depend more on herself,\\n      admitted that she had yielded so long that now she must continue to feed,\\n      dress and assist her charge in the most trivial things. Her food had to be\\n      placed in her mouth, the position of a hand or foot changed by some one\\n      else, although patient did so spontaneously when she chose. This went on\\n      for fifteen years, when the mother, growing old and feeble, died. Her\\n      maternal support being gone, the patient at once proved her ability to\\n      walk, to dress, to feed herself, and to seek light employment. Though far\\n      from well, she is equally far fro being a helpless, bed-ridden invalid.\\n      \\n A fourth case, still very vividly\\n      impressed on the writer\\'s mind, was one of a healthy, romping girl of 14,\\n      who, as happen in this remarkably capricious disease, in the midst of\\n      perfect health, one day took to her bed and remained there with all the\\n      symptoms of neurasthenia, involving first the spinal and finally the\\n      cerebral nerves. This patient was very amiable, conscientious, and\\n      sensible, never loquacious, and not troubled with hypochondriacal thoughts\\n      or sensations. Tiredness was the only expression she used in describing\\n      her feelings. There was literally no variation from this condition, which\\n      confined her to her bed for years, till she grew from a girl to a woman.\\n      Eating and sleeping well, and improving perceptibly in personal appearance\\n      and character, yet she lay on her couch tired and watched over with\\n      unremitting care by a most anxious mother, showing her solicitude and\\n      sympathy in every feature. Once, in the second year of the disease, a\\n      favorable interruption occurred. The mother, still a young woman, gave\\n      birth to another child. During her confinement the neurasthenic patient\\n      was in charge of her mother\\'s nurse, assisted by other servants. The\\n      nurse, while devoted to the daughter, agreed with the writer that excess\\n      of sympathy was injurious, and used her best and judicious endeavors\\n      gradually to persuade the patient to make some physical effort at walking\\n      and standing. In this she was so successful that in two weeks she\\n      accompanied the girl on half-mile walks up and down hill, finally without\\n      assistance. Thus, recovery seemed assured, and everything was favorable\\n      progressing towards it when the mother, having fully recovered, again took\\n      charge of her daughter, with the result that she at once took to her\\n      lounge and remained there two years longer. About that time other advice\\n      was urged and gladly acceded to, with the result that the case was\\n      diagnosed by an eminent surgeon as spinal paralysis in consequence of\\n      concussion, though it could never be shown when and where it occurred.\\n      Salves, plasters, anodynes, nervines, and electricity did no good, but\\n      effectually destroyed appetite and digestion, which higher to had been\\n      normal. So this adviser resigned in favor of a third, who, being a younger\\n      and less prejudiced man, agreed perfectly with the writer\\'s original\\n      opinion. He advised return to moderate exercise, avoidance of drugs, and\\n      less display of sympathy. This, though formerly rejected as\\n      \"unkind,\" was now acceded to as coming from a nerve- specialist,\\n      fresh from Europe, at that time very rare. Still attending the other\\n      members of the family, the writer had sample opportunity of observing the\\n      course of the case. Improvement was very slow and uncertain till financial\\n      misfortune overtook the family. Almost with a bound our patient left her\\n      cough, and, organizing a kindergarten, strove energetically in supporting\\n      herself and assisting her mother. The change came about in less than three\\n      weeks, and resulted in perfect recovery.\\n      \\n At this point another very instructive\\n      case of very speedy recovery, after six or seven years of neurasthenic\\n      prostration, deserves to be mentioned. A woman of 35 had been in bed and\\n      on the lounge most of the time for nearly seven years, at the end of which\\n      time she became my patient, her regular medical attendant having gone to\\n      Europe. She was of very amiable disposition and as sensitive as she was\\n      weak. Her symptoms, as in the other cases, were instantaneous exhaustion\\n      on the least physical exertion. She could give herself up to no mental\\n      occupation beyond directing her house-hold affairs, the education of her\\n      son, and the rehearsal of her numerous sensations. She had not been my\\n      patient long when her husband failed in business, so that the family was\\n      reduced from very comfortable circumstances to a condition which made it\\n      necessary for the patient to make her own living and that of the family.\\n      This she almost at once proceeded to do, setting aside all other\\n      considerations and establishing a boarding-house, where she did most of\\n      the work herself. This she has done now for ten or twelve years without a\\n      serious relapse. The time involved in the period of convalescence was\\n      scarcely more than three weeks, a although her work maybe said to have\\n      begun at the moment her resolution was taken.\\n      \\n Prognostics.-From these and other cases\\n      in and outside of the writer\\'s practice, it is safe to say that the\\n      majority of cases of neurasthenia recover, though years may elapse before\\n      that period. We learn, furthermore, that recoveries, especially of very\\n      inveterate cases, depend on conditions beyond the control of the\\n      physician, as was the case in the above-recorded instances, where\\n      circumstances forced the patient to cases to wish for recovery and to make\\n      an effort of the will. This having been once accomplished self-confidence,\\n      for a long time in abeyance, was permanently restored.\\n      \\n Curability, further, depends very much\\n      on the temperament of the patient, whether amiable, tractable and\\n      confiding in the honest endeavors of the physician, or whether refractory,\\n      suspicious, untruthful, selfish and antagonistic, of a disposition\\n      impossible to win over on account of unnatural distrust of every\\n      well-meaning person. The degree of intelligence of patients also has a\\n      pronounced influence on the result. The most readily curable cases are\\n      those acquired without hereditary predisposition, where the cause is found\\n      in the absence of food and sleep, also where sorrow and anxiety can be\\n      averted or counteracted by judicious conduct of near relatives and\\n      friends.\\n      \\n Dietetic Treatment.-This, as medicinal\\n      treatment, must be governed by the stage at which the case comes into the\\n      physician\\'s hands-whether yet in its prodromal, its acute or its chronic\\n      phase. The prodromal stage of the disease has no very decided\\n      pathognomonic signs. The most that can be recognized in this stage is that\\n      the patient\\'s habits or duties are of a kind which will eventually lead to\\n      obdurate neurasthenia if not arrested in time by removing the exciting\\n      causes. Too much pleasure, as well as too much care, especially in girls\\n      and woman, tends to neglect of food and rest, in the absence of which,\\n      excitements, whether of pleasure or care, begets a state of unrest in\\n      which repose is disagreeable. With such a condition comes a list of\\n      incipient casual complaints of headache, imperfect sleep, notional ways of\\n      eating, working or playing. A few questions will determine whether the\\n      patient is living according to normal or abnormal habits with regard to\\n      appetite, sleep and occupation. Where these are found, their alteration to\\n      normal ways must be instead on. It is unnecessary to say that this is\\n      easier said than done, for it will probably meet with serious objections\\n      on the part of the patient, if not on that of her relatives; for most\\n      likely she has examinations for college to prepare for, involving several\\n      months of dose and careful study at night, and the patient cannot waste\\n      time in sleeping and eating while cramming that little excited and\\n      ambitions brain. A failure in the examinations would be as much of a\\n      disappointment to parents as to patient, who proves, as usual, that this\\n      appellation is a misnomer. She accordingly goes in as she please, lied by\\n      an increasing morbidly ambitions impulse, and the result is likely to be\\n      the mournful satisfaction on the part of the physician of being obliged to\\n      say, \"I told you before what would happen.\" Of course, all\\n      regret the now evident nerve-prostration, while, if the doctor had\\n      succeeded in enforcing his rules, he would in many cases experience the\\n      still more painful reproach of having been too severe. Nevertheless,\\n      absolute firmness and a kindly but unflinching exertion of his will,\\n      without the least compromise, reward the physician with the best results\\n      in such cases.\\n      \\n When the case, after the stage of\\n      excitement and untiring restlessness (at which it would still be speedily\\n      curable by simple dietetic rules) has, after weeks or months, entered upon\\n      the phase of painful prostration, here we encounter backache, oppressive\\n      headache, and absolute loss of mental or bodily endurance, measures of\\n      dietetic management are much less effective and much more difficult to\\n      find. it is at this stage that slight rise of temperature will occur,\\n      especially towards evening; then the backache and headache disappear, the\\n      pallor is replaced by a flush of color, the eyes lose their listless look,\\n      and the patient is inclined to enter upon some diversion or excitement,\\n      followed by a restless night and a morning of exhaustion and a renewal of\\n      all painful sensations. Most of such patients feel much better in the\\n      evening when they are ready for some entertainment, while in a normal\\n      state this would be the time for relaxation and repose.\\n      \\n The dietetic treatment of this stage is\\n      methodical rest. In severe cases the patient will do well to remain in bed\\n      for several days or even for weeks. It is well to shorten this period as\\n      much as possible and to insist on walking about, or, at least. sitting for\\n      a specified time every day. This may be varied b equally specified periods\\n      of rest in the recumbent position.\\n      \\n Irregularities of eating are at this\\n      and at all times to be superseded by the most rigid regularity of meals.\\n      The traditional and conventional three-meal system, however well adapted\\n      to the needs of a vigorous man or woman, does not agree with the\\n      neurasthenic patient. It is much better that these should eat oftener;\\n      four times a day is best in most cases, for the simple reason that in this\\n      way a patient, while eating less at a time, consumes more food in the\\n      aggregate.\\n      \\n As neurasthenic patients are rarely\\n      troubled with absolute aversion to wholesome food, they are generally able\\n      to consume a liberal quantity, about which it is only needful to remark\\n      here that the food should be selected from among the articles and dishes\\n      which the patient likes, provided they belong to the order of good, normal\\n      articles of food, to the exclusion of those which simply please the taste\\n      without being digestible. A dish entirely of meat or \"animal\\n      food\" is as far from being a good diet for neurasthenics as one\\n      consisting entirely of \"vegetable\" food. As a rule, the diet\\n      list should comprise one-third of nitrogenous material and two-thirds of\\n      carbohydrates. Together with these, it is a great mistake to neglect the\\n      fats, such as good butter and the fats of meats. And, lastly, every\\n      patient of this kind should be made to drink some water often, a dietetic\\n      feature too often neglected.\\n      \\n During this stage, actually fatiguing\\n      exercise of body and mind should be avoided, while, on the other hand, the\\n      patient\\'s mind should be directed away from herself, in which she is much\\n      assisted by withholding a certain kind of emotional sympathy, quite as\\n      natural as it is difficult to repress on the part of affectionate persons.\\n      Of this, a few words further on.\\n      \\n There is no definite time for the\\n      duration of this stage, which, however, depends largely on the time during\\n      which the exciting causes have acted, either aided by or without a\\n      predisposition. It is certain, however, that the sooner it is recognized\\n      and the exciting causes eliminated, so much the sooner recovery will\\n      begin. But there is a stage at which the best of experience and judgment\\n      often fail, especially in very inveterate cases. If the case is one of a\\n      patient whom the physician has had opportunity of watching at least since\\n      the earlier stages, the difficulty is not so great as it is in old cases\\n      months or even of several years\\' duration which come to treatment late. In\\n      these, the line between the intermediate stage and incipient convalescence\\n      cannot be drawn. The patient is as neurasthenic and hypochondriacal as\\n      ever; cannot bear the slightest mental or bodily exertion, not even a word\\n      or a look, without sings of apparent exhaustion, while nearly the whole\\n      time is spent in bed under anxious care of sympathetic attendants. In such\\n      cases, having become assured, by careful physical examination, of the\\n      absence of organic disease, seeing the patient generally well nourished\\n      and in fair muscular condition, the physician is warranted in assuming\\n      that the disease has run its course, that whatever morbid (pathological)\\n      process there may have been progressing in the nervous system, this\\n      process has now come to and end, but it has left the patient\\'s mental\\n      condition habituated to the moods of the past months or years, and fixed,\\n      as it were, indelibly in the memory. It is the habit that now remains, not\\n      the disease.\\n      \\n If reasonably sure of this, and calling\\n      to mind the rapid recoveries and the circumstances attending them, as\\n      above detailed, the physician is now safe in ordering a more energetic\\n      treatment, calculated to rouse the self-reliance of the patient. All\\n      visible signs of sympathy must now be set aside; the actins and demeanor\\n      of the attendants should, from this time, if not before, be changed so as\\n      to give the patient the impression that she is no longer an invalid, but\\n      expected to rely on her own exertion. Instead of being fed, the food\\n      should be placed where she must go for and eat it. She should now be\\n      expected to dress and attend, without assistance, to her natural wants.\\n      This, with some temperaments, is almost impossible, with al extremely\\n      difficult. The best course to pursue is to remove such patients from\\n      sympathetic relatives or friends, and to place them in charge of kind,\\n      reliable, but eminently practical nurses.\\n      \\n The first effect of this is either to\\n      throw the patient into a stage of helpless despondency, which, again\\n      appealing powerfully to the sympathies of those nearest to her, often\\n      frustrates the physician\\'s plans which, if firmly but kindly adhered to,\\n      would, ere long, prove of their superiority by signs of returning\\n      self-reliance and absence of complaints on the part of the patient. A\\n      second form of effect is that occurring in patients of obstreperous,\\n      selfish disposition, whose opposition and even anger is aroused by being\\n      thrown on their own resources after the removal of depressing and\\n      unpractical sympathy. This opposition or temper, often manifested in all\\n      sorts of intrigues and subterfuges on the part of the patient, if not\\n      supinely yielded to by sympathetic persons, will finally be replaced by a\\n      more rational disposition. On the whole, anger or active opposition are\\n      signs of returning energy, which, once coming to the consciousness of the\\n      patient, takes the form of self- reliance. it is this way that the cures\\n      of chronic cases above related can be explained, and physicians should\\n      profit by such experience for the benefit of their patients.\\n      \\n The general dietetic management now\\n      readily follows from what has been said, and needs only a few general\\n      modifications. The first duty of the physician will be to test the degree\\n      of reliance to be placed on the patient and her friends, ad to win them\\n      over if possible to his plans, and his success will be in proportion to\\n      the degree of confidence he is able to inspire. This personal confidence\\n      should not degenerate into a mere personal liking or attachment of a\\n      sympathy-craving neurasthenic who should discover henceforth that all\\n      sentimental expressing of sympathy are about to take a practical form,\\n      aiming at a definite result-the patient\\'s health-which she wishes but\\n      cannot exert her will to attain. The best and often the only way to do\\n      away with sentiment and to reach practical kindness is to remove the\\n      patient from certain home influence, and to place her in a hospital or\\n      elsewhere under the management of competent nurses who, without being\\n      selfish, know how to exert a certain amount of wholesome push as fast as\\n      the patient can bear it. Without the removal of sentimental sympathy, all\\n      efforts at counteracting the purely hypochondriacal side of neurasthenia\\n      are useless.\\n      \\n In these cases of neurasthenia as yet\\n      uncomplicated with the hypochondriacal element of introspective nosomania,\\n      there is only one unconditional rule to be followed, especially in\\n      acquired cases whose evident cause was incessant, conscientious work of\\n      mind and body, together with insufficient food and sleep. Such cases come\\n      on very insidiously, the loss of strength-that is, the actual waste of\\n      nerve-substance-being just a trifle grater than the quantity restored, the\\n      patient unconsciously using up a minute part of her capital every day.\\n      Here the rule should be to reverse matters to insuring a supply of\\n      nourishment and time for its assimilation greater than was the case\\n      heretofore. The case of young school-girls belong in this class. The time\\n      of food and rest should be carefully controlled at home, the duty of the\\n      physician being to educate indifferent and ignorant parents up to an\\n      appreciation of the nature of the case. It is generally not difficult to\\n      open their eyes through the medium of their anxiety concerning their\\n      children\\'s health. Having thus insured sufficient rest and food at home,\\n      the physician\\'s next object of attention should be the regulations of the\\n      school. Here is the point where teachers have an opportunity of exerting\\n      their most practical influence. It should be made obligatory on the part\\n      of teachers to institute inquiry as to whether pupils have had their meals\\n      before coming to school. This they could often ascertain without a\\n      question, by reading the pupil\\'s condition in her emaciated form, pale\\n      face and nervous manner. To guard against neglect at home, it would be an\\n      easy matter to insist that all pupils of public and private schools should\\n      bring with them some proper food. The few who do so generally bring\\n      sweets-an apple, orange or a few dry crackers-when a piece of good bread\\n      and slice of cold meat would be what they actually need. All pupils should\\n      pass inspection, and if remiss in this important particular, the\\n      delinquent should be dismissed with several marks against her. To expect\\n      this of teachers would be a great advance in the place of futile\\n      innovations of endeavoring to send forth from our common schools graduates\\n      in arts and sciences.\\n      \\n Sudden Effects.-A large number of cases\\n      of neurasthenia, especially those complicated with inveterate\\n      Hypochondriasis, are frequently traced to some sudden occurrence, having\\n      the effect of a mental or physical shock. In one patient, a vigorous girl,\\n      used to romping, climbing and running lie a boy, the cause was supposed to\\n      be a slight thump she received during a game of blindman\\'s-buff. She\\n      thought nothing of it at the time, but it was suggested long after the\\n      patient\\'s illness began. In another case some mental shock of joy or\\n      grief, not very severe and such as is often experienced in every person\\'s\\n      life, is the beginning of months of nervous prostration.\\n      \\n There is quite an array of evidence\\n      that neurasthenia which has entered upon a hypochondriacal stage or\\n      complication with or without a strong hysterical admixture, is curable by\\n      sudden impressions in the form of a shock, or more gradually by frequent\\n      repetitions of an impression. Such cases, as I have shown above, occur\\n      most commonly in the stage when what may be considered the essential\\n      pathological disturbances of function have run their course and have left\\n      the patient in a state of mental disturbance which indicated that the\\n      patient\\'s recovery depends entirely upon her volition. But there is none,\\n      and so far nothing has succeeded in arousing it. Persuasion is as useless\\n      and irritating, as argument would be in a case of insanity with a fixed\\n      illusion. The resemblance between this and the state of mind of a\\n      hypochondriacal neurasthenic is very close. She cannot move nor thick.\\n      Exhaustion overcomes her and keeps her its victim for years, when suddenly\\n      the scene changes, and a few days or weeks suffice to restore the patient\\n      to activity. In one instance it is attributed to medical, in another to\\n      \"mind cure,\" in a third to \"Christian science;\" in\\n      still other cases massage has done it, in others again \"magnetic\\n      influence,\" in others the very powerful factor necessity. It is\\n      certain that cases of this kind, produced by sudden effects on the mind of\\n      a predisposed person, are also cured by such effects. Whatever the visible\\n      form of these effects may be -whether that of \"Christian\\n      science,\" joy, grief or absolute inexorable necessity, there is\\n      always to be noticed a certain force and condition involving the modern\\n      idea of suggestion, which comes to the patient in an irresistible degree\\n      and now sets the function of the will in motion again.\\n      \\n Experience teaches that it is by no\\n      means a matter of indifference which of these forms of effect are brought\\n      into action. In one case it is the professional Christian scientist\\'s\\n      method, in another the almost brutal exertion of a person\\'s will combined\\n      with some physical force. In either case the patient is aroused from his\\n      inertia, and discovers his powers of mental and bodily ability to act.\\n      \\n A deplorable result is that recoveries\\n      after such effects are attributed in the popular mind to supernatural\\n      causes. That such is not the case may be gathered form instances occurring\\n      in very sensible and intelligent patients, whose reason is scarcely ever\\n      so far disturbed and weakened that they do not resent the proposition of\\n      trying, e.g., Christian science or mind cure.\\n      \\n Nevertheless, it is the mind cure which\\n      the intelligent patient needs quite as much as the ignorant and\\n      superstitious person; the difference is only the form in which the\\n      influencing force is applied. While in one case it is obedience to the\\n      candidly expressed instructions of the physician, in the other case the\\n      result is the to mystification. In either case it is the powerful stimulus\\n      of hope and aroused confidence that recovery will be realized.\\n      \\n The definition of suggestion does not\\n      fully cover the meaning, because the influence employed is greater than\\n      mere suggestion. The physician\\'s plan of action should be straightforward\\n      assurance of recovery, a direct appeal to hope, and an unceasing endeavor\\n      to arouse the self-reliance of the patient, not so much by verbal\\n      exhortations as by a manner and department from which the patient learns\\n      more readily than from words what is expected. If the attitude of the\\n      physician is appreciated, and seconded by the relatives and attendants, a\\n      favorable result is much more certain to follow.\\n      \\n Hypnotism is not advisable. There are\\n      now existing ancient neurasthenic invalids dating from the times of\\n      spiritualism when they were famous \"mediums.\" Hypnotism weakness\\n      the will and nervous endurance, and produces a predisposition to emotional\\n      nervousness with an intractable erotic admixture. The suggestions sought\\n      to be instilled into a hypnotized patient amount to nothing. The mental\\n      influence of mystical treatment administered while the patients is awake\\n      is much more powerful in awaking hope and confidence than the uncertain\\n      effects of an abnormal state like that of hypnotism. Mystification, again,\\n      though sometimes unavoidable with the best intention, is less powerful\\n      than direct and intelligible encouragement. While resort to mystification\\n      should be shunned by reputable physicians, the question arises as to what\\n      shall be done with the many who, from lack of intelligence or education,\\n      are entirely beyond the reach of honest common sense, and who will persist\\n      in mystifying themselves, who remain neurasthenic invalids in spite of the\\n      best regulations of the physician, and who do not recover unless their\\n      encouragement follows some mystical formalities which alone arouse their\\n      \"faith\" and finally their confidence and will-power. For the\\n      present there is no way out of the dilemma but to submit such patients to\\n      the suggestive methods of what is popularly known as mind cure and\\n      Christian science. In doing so, physicians should use their influence as\\n      far as possible in selecting the most honest persons of this class.\\n      \\n DISCUSSION.\\n      \\n JAMES C. WOOD, M.D.: I have nothing but\\n      words of praise for Dr. Wesselhoeft\\'s excellent paper. It is very evident\\n      that the author\\'s inspiration came not from books but from actual contact\\n      with neurasthenic subjects, for the impress of originality is most\\n      conspicuous. It is a production which could only come from one of\\n      experience and from a reasoner. I consider it a most valuable contribution\\n      to the literature of that now most interesting subject,\\n      \"neurasthenia\".\\n      \\n The doctor, in his paper, has sometimes\\n      used the term \"neurasthenia\" instead of\\n      \"neurasthenia.\" The first of these means, according to Thomas,\\n      great nervous power or excitement; the second, nervous debility. I taken\\n      it from the context that the subject dealt with is neurasthenia. To the\\n      average mind there exists what seems to me a needless confusion regarding\\n      the terms, nervous prostration, hysteria and hystero-neurosis. As I\\n      understand these terms they define distinct conditions, though there is a\\n      frequent blending the one with the other. The term nervous prostration,\\n      which is a synonym of neurasthenia, defines itself; the term hysteria\\n      should be restricted to those general neuroses characterized particularly\\n      by psychical manifestations, though not infrequently by motor, sensory,\\n      secretory, vasomotor and reflex derangements as well; while the term\\n      hysteroneurosis implies the uterine origin of symptoms manifesting\\n      themselves in organs remote from the uterus without structural changes in\\n      such organs, being the direct result of reflex nervous influence starting\\n      from the uterus. The last term does not occur in the paper under\\n      discussion. From the standpoint of a gynecologist I think that this is\\n      misleading.\\n      \\n Let us see why and how it is that these\\n      three conditions (I will not call them diseases) are so frequently\\n      associated. I think that all will admit the frequent occurrence in woman\\n      of reflex symptoms, the result of pelvic lesions. An irritation staring\\n      form the pelvis is conveyed to the genito-spinal centre, thence to any or\\n      all organs with which this centre communicates. The organ oftener involved\\n      than any other is the stomach. This is shown by the frequent occurrence of\\n      nausea and vomiting following conception. The nervous system may have been\\n      previously involved, but oftener it becomes so only after the nutrition is\\n      depraved, which, sooner or later, occurs if the pelvic lesion is not\\n      removed. The depraved blood fails to supply the nerve centres with that\\n      which they need to sustain them, and they become anaemic. Prostration is\\n      but a subjective manifestation of the anaemia, and it varies in degree\\n      from a slight indisposition to the most abject helplessness.\\n      \\n If, then, nervous prostration may have\\n      its beginning in a pelvic lesion, is it possible for a pelvic lesion to be\\n      inaugurated by systemic disturbances? Personally, I believe that it is,\\n      and offer this explanation as the modus operandi by which such a lesion is\\n      induced: Marked circulatory changes nearly always attend nervous\\n      prostration. The circulation is presided over by the vaso-motor system,\\n      and wear and repair depend upon the proper regulation of this system. If\\n      it becomes disturbed, the bloodvessels dilate or contract unduly, with\\n      resulting local hyperaemia or local anaemia, as the case maybe. The\\n      climacteric flushes are the result of such disturbance. The alternate\\n      coldness and heat of the extremities, so often associated with rectal and\\n      uterine lesions, is another familiar illustration. If the brain is\\n      involved, either insomnia or drowsiness occur, depending upon whether the\\n      brain is anaemic or hyperaemic. Flatulence, gastralgia, and nervous\\n      dyspepsia result when the stomach is similarly affected. The womb and the\\n      ovaries, because of the periodical congestion imposed upon them, are\\n      oftener implicated by these unnatural circulatory disturbances than any of\\n      the pelvic organs, and in time also become unduly hyperaemic or anaemic,\\n      as the case may be.\\n      \\n It will thus be seen that nervous\\n      prostration may exist independently of pelvic lesions, or, conversely,\\n      pelvic lesions may exist independently of nervous prostration.\\n      Nevertheless, the two are frequently associated, and this fact ought, I\\n      believe, to be kept in mind in dealing with the affection known as\\n      neurasthenia. Hysterical manifestations nearly always come to the surface\\n      in nervous prostration, and they also frequently attend pelvic lesions.\\n      Indeed, the term \"hystero-psychosis\" has been coined for the\\n      purpose of defining certain psychical disturbances of presumably pelvic\\n      origin, and in the broadest sense neurasthenia is not uncommonly an\\n      hysteroneurosis. It is the frequent association of these three conditions\\n      which, it seems to me, makes it more practicable to study them conjointly.\\n      \\n The special symptoms of nervous\\n      prostration are most variable. Introspection, as Dr. Wesselhoeft has\\n      pointed out, makes of the patient a nosomaniac. The anaemic nerve centres\\n      are unduly impressionable, and a mental shock which would not seriously\\n      affect a stronger and more rugged woman falls with crushing force upon one\\n      whose nutrition is already depraved. In this way are developed disorders\\n      of sensibility, alternations of mobility, circulatory disturbances,\\n      anomalies of secretion and exertion, disorders of the gastro-intestinal\\n      canal, dermatoses, and general and psychical disturbances of all kinds.\\n      Many of these affections start from pelvic lesions, and are nearly always\\n      associated with depravity of nutrition and more or less nervous\\n      prostration.\\n      \\n Some of the worst symptoms of\\n      neurasthenia with which I have had to contend have been hyperaesthesia of\\n      the articulations, giving rise to the so-called \"hysterical\\n      joint.\" Here the prostration is usually not profound, and it is\\n      possible to apply the somewhat energetic treatment recommended by Dr.\\n      Wesselhoeft. I remember one case very distinctly, the detailed history of\\n      which I shall give in another place, which brought me much reputation\\n      because of the \"remarkable\" cure I was fortunate enough to make.\\n      \\n The patient, a beautiful girl of\\n      eighteen, had been bed- ridden for three years with supposed hip-joint\\n      disease. She was in college before assuming the ride of an invalid, and\\n      worried much over her studies and work. She sustained a fall a short time\\n      previously to taking to her bed, and to this fall the injury to the hip\\n      was attributed. She had been from physician to physician and from\\n      sanitarium to sanitarium without receiving benefit. All of the numerous\\n      medical men under whose care she had been, directed their attention to the\\n      hip and applied the classical treatment for morbus coxarius without avail.\\n      The patient had finally reached a point where introspection was her chief\\n      occupation and her mind dwelt almost continually upon a \"diseased\\n      hip.\" She was finally brought to me, coming in an invalid\\'s chair and\\n      looking the very picture of dependency. There was a slight degree of\\n      anaemia, though this was not marked. Notwithstanding the expression\\n      expression of abjectness the girl did not look seriously ill. The hip was\\n      excessively tender upon pressure, but there was no local increase of\\n      temperature, no evidences of fever and suppuration, and forcible\\n      apposition by striking the heel was not very painful. More less spastic\\n      contraction of the flexor muscles of the affected side existed, which gave\\n      to the limb an appearance of actual shortening, which was very deceptive.\\n      Hysterical symptoms were common. On examination I found the left ovary\\n      exquisitely tender. Compression of the ovary increased the pain in the hip\\n      most decidedly and gave rise to much nervous agitation. I did not,\\n      therefore, deem it wise to recommend local treatment other than the daily\\n      use of the hot douche. She had long been a victim of ovarian\\n      dysmenorrhoea. I placed upon the ankle of the affected limb three pounds\\n      of bar-lead, prescribed a pair of crutches and insisted upon her walking.\\n      The lead was used to overcome the spastic contraction as well as for its\\n      moral effect. I did not deem the joint lesion of such a character as to\\n      used extension. In two months\\' time this patient discarded her crutches\\n      for a cane. Six weeks later she put up the cane and is now perfectly well.\\n      \\n This was a case in which somewhat harsh\\n      measures were eminently appropriate.\\n      \\n In marked contrast to the case just\\n      recorded is the following: Mrs.-, aet. 47, widow for twenty years. She is\\n      a devoted church-woman, and for years was a leader in all charitable work\\n      done in the community in which she resided. Through friends she was urged\\n      to consult me, and I think that the call to the neighboring town in which\\n      she lived was countermanded at least four or five times before the finally\\n      mustered up courage and strength enough to see me. Upon reaching the\\n      bedside I found my patient in a room made dark by closed blinds, over\\n      which were hung heavy blankets to shut out every ray of light. The mirror\\n      was turned toward the wall for fear a ray of light might strike it and\\n      flesh throughout the darkened room. Nor did the patient rest under these\\n      extreme precautions, for the eyes were protected with two pairs of colored\\n      glasses with side attachments. Hyperaesthesia of the sense of hearing was\\n      equally marked and the noise was excluded from the room by double doors\\n      whose keyholes were stuffed with cotton. She l so had her ears filled with\\n      cotton, over which she wore ear-mufflers. She was emaciated to an extreme\\n      degree, and had been reduced to her miserable condition by a series of\\n      events which frequently precede profound neurasthenia. Her husband was\\n      killed during the war, and she was left childless. Twelve months previous\\n      to taking to her bed she nursed her mother through a long and fatal\\n      illness. This greatly prostrated her, yet she kept up until a favorite\\n      brother-in-law was thrown from a carriage and killed. This was the last\\n      straw, and the shock compelled her to take to her bed. In due time loss of\\n      appetite with irritability of the stomach developed, which, of course, led\\n      to marked depravity of nutrition. With the anaemia came hyperaesthesia of\\n      the special senses, spinal irritation, headache, hysterical\\n      manifestations, etc. There was no series pelvic lesion, although she had\\n      been much treated for an alleged uterine displacement with congestion.\\n      Unfortunately, she was encouraged, instead of discouraged, in her\\n      invalidism, and she soon became a nosomaniac of the worst type. She had\\n      written down her symptoms one at a time, and the record is such a typical\\n      one that I should like to give it in full, but time forbids.\\n      \\n With great difficulty the patient was\\n      moved on a cough to a private hospital and placed under the Weir Mitchell\\n      treatment. I ignored the pelvic trouble entirely. It is unnecessary to\\n      give in detail the progress of the case from day to day after this\\n      treatment was inaugurated. Suffice it to say that the improvement was of\\n      the most marked character, and in six weeks from the time she entered the\\n      hospital she walked to her carriage with her eyes and ears unprotected.\\n      She soon resumed her church and charitable work, in which she again takes\\n      much delight.\\n      \\n This woman wanted to get well. She was\\n      a woman of pure motives and high ideals. She had, in the language of Dr.\\n      Wesselhoeft, the wish, but, unaided, not the will. She required the aid of\\n      an intelligent, strong-minded, nurse who could bring to her exercise\\n      applied in such a way as to enable her to assimilate food without the\\n      expenditure of nerve force. She co- operated with her physician and nurse\\n      in every possible way, and as soon as the anaemic nerve cells became\\n      flushed with new blood she began to improve. To have commanded this\\n      patient \"to take up her bed and walk\" before improving her\\n      nutrition would have been as unscientific as to have placed the first\\n      patient in bed with extension and counter-extension applied to the limb. I\\n      know of no class of cases requiring for their successful treatment more\\n      tact and discrimination than that under consideration.\\n      \\n I feel confident that I have many times\\n      cut the affection short in its prodromal stage by removing the girl from\\n      college work and insisting upon open-air exercise. Static electricity has,\\n      in my hands, proved exceedingly useful both during the prodromal stage and\\n      that of convalescence.\\n      \\n I will conclude by saying that I have\\n      been impressed with the frequency with which an hereditary history of\\n      epilepsy has been met with in the cases of neurasthenia passing under my\\n      observation.'\n",
      " 'Tresorie - SOME OF THE DISEASES PREVENTING AND COMPLICATION PREGNANCY\\n[Diseases Preventing & Complicating Pregnancy]\\n\\n STERILITY.-DeSinety, Treub, Furbinger,\\n      et al., attribute 50 per cent. of unproductive marriages to the husbands,\\n      saying that sterility in the male is more often the cause of barren\\n      marriages than is generally supposed.\\n      \\n This cause of sterility I pass by, as\\n      also sterility due to mechanical obstruction, incomplete ovulation and the\\n      numerous other causes of this condition, too manifold for mere\\n      enumeration, to consider obesity as a causative agent in this condition. I\\n      need not say that the advocates for surgical interference for the relief\\n      of this condition are legion. Sims makes the assertion that sterility can\\n      be cured by surgical means only. That, of course, is Allopathic arguing\\n      pure and simple. Cases requiring surgical interference do arise, but any\\n      treatment which raises the nutrition of the entire organism, improves the\\n      blood-formation, and favors the resorption of pathological products in the\\n      sexual organs, is to be regarded as the indicated remedy.\\n      \\n Published statements are my authority\\n      for saying that excellent results have followed the administration of\\n      drugs, nevertheless; and in complete defiance of all therapeutic measures,\\n      a certain percentage of women remain barren; for with the more occult\\n      causes of sterility we remain, as yet, unacquainted, consequently they\\n      cannot all be reached with say kind of treatment whatever.\\n      \\n The following case I report somewhat in\\n      detail. Whilst not an exceptional case at all, it bears directly upon the\\n      subject under consideration, and possesses, it seems to me, some decidedly\\n      interesting features. My object in selecting this particular one is to\\n      call attention, if possible, to a condition not sufficiently considered.\\n      Mrs. J., aet. 26, married about two years and a half, appealed to my\\n      knowledge for a reason as to why she remained childless. The lady was\\n      carrying an excess of flesh, being under the medium height, and weighing\\n      186 pounds, but appeared to be in good health; family and previous history\\n      all that could be desired. Examination showed none of the common causes of\\n      sterility; neither, so far as I could ascertain, was the husband\\n      responsible for this unproductive condition of affairs. Some previous\\n      experiences of my own, with the added testimony of other and able men, was\\n      my reason for charging this condition of things to the excess of flesh,\\n      this, by the husband, being laughingly charged to excess of laziness.\\n      \\n We all, undoubtedly, are familiar with\\n      that peculiar disease of the blood-corpuscles which, whilst producing\\n      flesh, relaxes at the same time the muscular force; acting also, I\\n      believe, upon the muscular fibres of the uterus and upon the ovaries,\\n      inducing not only serious menstrual disorders but sterility. McKee,\\n      Philbert, and others give several instances of sterility chargeable to\\n      obesity, the women in question having been married several years without\\n      bearing children, and all became mothers after losing a portion of their\\n      flesh. If any other argument were needed in support of this theory we\\n      might turn to the quadrupeds, where we find the poorest breeders among the\\n      fleshiest animals. Fournel has a very able treatise on \"The Effects\\n      of Obesity on the Menstrual Functions and Parturition.\" Without\\n      having had any actual case of this description to deal with, he inclines\\n      very strongly towards the belief that obesity favors sterility. In the\\n      treatment of the case before mentioned, the patient was subjected to a\\n      daily massage of the entire body, with a special pelvic massage three\\n      times a week. This, in the main, consists in elevating the uterus as high\\n      as possible with the finger in the vagina, ending with a quick and decided\\n      vibratory motion. The diet received particular attention, as at this time\\n      there was a slight gastric ailment. The indicated remedy, Thuja, was given\\n      in the minimum dose. At the end of three months almost thirty pounds of\\n      flesh was gone, a considerable reduction. As an experiment, I recommended\\n      coitus in the knee-elbow position, advising that the lady remain quiet as\\n      long as possible after coition, with thighs well flexed. She became\\n      enciente, but miscarried at eight weeks. There was, comparatively\\n      speaking, but little pain and not much subsequent haemorrhage. She made a\\n      rapid recovery. Since then a living child has been born to them.\\n      \\n I believe I am safe in saying that this\\n      result would hardly have obtained were it not for the prophylactic\\n      measures adopted.\\n      \\n At the end of the first two months the\\n      patient was attacked with haemorrhage. A similar occurrence took place at\\n      irregular intervals during the following five months, the quantity of\\n      blood lost being much greater than that at the normal menstrual period.\\n      \\n For the greater part of the last five\\n      months she kept her bed, at the end of which time the tendency of the\\n      uterus to empty itself could be resisted no longer. A seven months\\' child\\n      was born, and is to-day doing well.\\n      \\n Pseudocyesis cerebral pregnancy,\\n      phantom pregnancy (whatever name we may call it by) is a disease which\\n      must come under the head of those \"complicating pregnancy.\" Mrs.\\n      M., a lady, married two or three years, aet. 29. Previous history good,\\n      always enjoying perfect health. When I first saw the lady in question she\\n      was a perfect picture of health, and, according to appearance and her own\\n      statements, about seven months pregnant. I made no examination. This\\n      appeared to be a thoroughly intelligent woman, and, according to her own\\n      statement, there was cessation of the menses. There certainly was an\\n      enlargement of the abdomen and breasts, a milky secretion, and the lady\\n      was sure that she felt foetal movement. On February 28th of the present\\n      year I was called to attend her in labor. Examination showed that no\\n      pregnancy existed. So far as I could ascertain there was no assignable\\n      origin for this condition other than nervous influences, the phenomena\\n      being purely muscular distension of the abdomen.\\n      \\n Mayham reports a case of a woman 73\\n      years old, claiming to be pregnant; he also claims that subsequently she\\n      was delivered of a child; this is an Allopathic report, however, of which\\n      we will take a Homoeopathic dose. Haultain reports three cases of cerebral\\n      pregnancy. In the first, he says no cause whatever was to be found; in the\\n      second, there was a small fibroid growth in the anterior uterine wall.\\n      Hauck reports a case where the vomiting, peristalsis, and flatus, caused\\n      by alcoholism were supposed to be caused by the pregnant state. Such cases\\n      are uncommon, but they emphasize the importance of making a thorough\\n      examination, in all cases where positive information is desired of the\\n      existence or non-existence of pregnancy.\\n      \\n Hyperemesis Gravidarum.-An animated\\n      discussion, held recently between two celebrated Allopaths of Stuttgart\\n      and Leipsic, has served to awaken a renewed interest in this subject,\\n      without in the least adding anything new to our stock of knowledge\\n      regarding its aetiology. Notwithstanding the frequency of the vomiting of\\n      pregnancy, its very distressing character in many instances, and its\\n      imminent, its very distressing character in many instances, and its\\n      imminent danger, we find but very few contributions of any value, to\\n      either the aetiology of the disorder or its therapeutics. I do not expect\\n      to add anything specially new myself, but it does seem to me that our\\n      knowledge of the vomiting of pregnancy, is to say the least, in a most\\n      contradictory state. Some physicians look upon it as a trifling matter,\\n      others as a thing to be endured, and some-these are in the right too-view\\n      even the mildest cases with gravity. Even in the mildest cases of morning\\n      sickness there is a constant drain upon the nervous system, putting the\\n      sufferer into a condition, in which she is very much less able to endure\\n      parturition than she would otherwise have been.\\n      \\n Dr. Harrison Mettler says: \"After\\n      careful inquiry I find that women who suffer from much morning sickness\\n      have as a rule, tedious or otherwise troublesome labors. I have observed\\n      in multiparae that at one time they will have much nausea and vomiting\\n      followed by a difficult labor, while at another time they will be quite\\n      free from the vomiting, and will pass through the succeeding labor with\\n      comparative ease.\" I must say my observations make me agree with Dr.\\n      Mettler entirely; when one thinks how rapidly the mildest of cases assume\\n      pernicious forms, indifference is certainly no longer to be excused. There\\n      is a voluminous literature upon this subject, and many and varied are the\\n      aetiological reasons given for this very variable affection, a large\\n      majority of writers coinciding in the opinion that \"many causes\\n      operate together,\" to produce what we are pleased to designate the\\n      \"vomiting of pregnancy.\" I believe myself that in a large\\n      percentage of cases, this pernicious vomiting is simply the result of a\\n      reflex neurosis. Undoubtedly uterine displacements frequently cause\\n      vomiting; but when this is so, and the displaced organ is raised by\\n      packing the vagina with aseptic wool, the vomiting ceases.\\n      \\n Lillie reports a number of cases, where\\n      obstinate vomiting was caused by a retroflexed uterus, and restoration of\\n      the organ caused a cessation of the disorder. Bezugloff having a\\n      persistent case of morning sickness, introduced a bougie it no the uterus,\\n      the intention being to produce abortion; the immediate result was a\\n      stoppage of the vomiting, and the pregnancy went on to full term.\\n      \\n In the case just cited, I must say that\\n      I believe it was the fright, caused by the thought of abortion being\\n      performed, more than the effects of introducing the bougie, which operated\\n      so successfully; I say now, as I said before, I believe that the\\n      pre-eminent cause of this kind of sickness must be looked for i the\\n      nervous system. Flint speaks of this form of sickness as being decidedly\\n      neurotic in its origin, and cites a number of cases of a chronic variety\\n      of dyspepsia frequently occurring in young girls. I had one such case come\\n      under my personal care. There was a persistent morning sickness, with this\\n      young lady, and a disagreeable nausea whenever food was taken; this\\n      patient was at some distance from her home, in a boarding school, and she\\n      will probably never know that the lady principal entertained very grave\\n      thoughts at one time in regard to her virtue. It certainly was very\\n      difficult to differentiate between this and the vomiting of pregnancy; it\\n      was, however, simply due to a vitiated nervous system. My theory is\\n      supported by Alt, who records a number of such cases; I cite one only, the\\n      case being that of a highly hysterical woman, six months pregnant,\\n      suffering from the gravest vomiting, and anxious that miscarriage be\\n      induced. She was making preparation for entering the hospital for this\\n      purpose, when one of her children was seized with pneumonia. The anxiety\\n      felt over the child, forced all thought of self from the mother\\'s mind;\\n      from that moment the vomiting ceased and she remained well until the\\n      termination of pregnancy.-Minchener Medicinische Wochenschrift.\\n      \\n Whilst saying that I believe this\\n      disease to be in the majority of cases of purely nervous origin, I would\\n      not imply thereby that it is not to be feared, far from it; if neglected,\\n      we know how likely it is to pass quickly beyond treatment and our patient\\n      succumb from sheer exhaustion.\\n      \\n In the treatment cited such as\\n      insertion of bougies, dilation of the os, pelvic massage, etc., I believe\\n      it is merely the \"doing something,\" no matter much what it is,\\n      so long as you have gained the confidence of your patient, that does good.\\n      We have seen how suddenly Hyperemesis will cease if the patient be\\n      alarmed; it may be, has often been, and will to again, cured by a process\\n      skin to suggestion. Kattenback had a case where the patient, a primipara,\\n      was seized with an incorrigible vomiting. It was suggested to her that her\\n      stomach contained some lumps of unwholesome material and their removal\\n      would cure her. Some milk was given her, and the stomach ceremoniously\\n      washed out. its contents bore no indications of either over-acidity or\\n      abnormal ferment She was informed that she was all right and the vomiting\\n      would not return; neither did if, and she was safely delivered at term.\\n      \\n There is a familiar and now well-know\\n      phenomena, by which these neurotics can be influenced; I speak of\\n      hypnotism; it is due to purely subjective conditions.\\n      \\n There is an identity of the hypnotic\\n      susceptibility with the condition of hysteria, and it is along these lines\\n      that we can work. Just as many times as I have tried this method of\\n      treatment, for these cases of excessive vomiting, just so many times has\\n      it given me gratifying results.\\n      \\n The patient can be to sleep by\\n      bi-ocular pressure, and the idea of cure suggested; the operation may have\\n      to be repeated several times, at intervals of a day or so, but you will be\\n      rewarded by the cessation of the vomiting, often with but one suggestion.\\n      Where the patient is not easily controlled by means of the bi-ocular\\n      pressure, Luy\\'s revolving mirror is a never failing resource.'\n",
      " 'Tresorie - PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS [Presidential Address]\\n\\n THE ROLE OF HOMOEOPATHY IN THE SECOND\\n      \\n By ALVA BENJAMIN, M.B.CH.B., F.F.HOM.\\n      \\n Such a system of medicine must\\n      recognize that it is as much an art as a science, and that healing is a\\n      relationship between two living personalities. It must recognize too, that\\n      the sick individual has to take an active part in his treatment and not be\\n      merely the passive recipient of this or that treatment. For just as it is\\n      rightly said that man does not live by alone, so should it be emphasized\\n      that man cannot be cured by medicine alone. He must see to it himself that\\n      he lives as far as possible a physically and psychically healthy life.\\n      Indeed, each individual has a power within himself to help in his own\\n      cure.\\n      \\n Do the official schools of medicine\\n      teach such an art today? I am afraid not: they are so intent on seeking\\n      the specific treatment for this or that named disease or the antibiotic\\n      that will most effectively put out of action the organism regarded as the\\n      cause of the disease, that they are losing sight of the individual\\n      himself.\\n      \\n But Homoeopathy in its persistent\\n      search for the reactions of the individual to his environment in the\\n      broadest sense, no matter of what the patient is complaining surely\\n      fulfills these requirements, especially when it is recognized that the\\n      homoeopathic potencies do not anything to the patient as do the drugs of\\n      the dominant school, but rather stimulate the patients own recuperative\\n      powers to overcome the infection or re - establish the normal metabolism\\n      which has become deranged by the illness.\\n      \\n When you consider how the homoeopathic\\n      physician diagnoses the individuality of his patient over and above the\\n      name of the disease from which he is suffering, and uses for the purpose\\n      of his prescription rather than the name of the disease this personal\\n      diagnosis of the patients mental and emotional reactions, his responses to\\n      changes in weather conditions, the alternations in his environment which\\n      influence his symptoms, etc., one realize how very individualistic is the\\n      Homoeopathic prescription fitted to that particular patient.\\n      \\n The homoeopathic physician does not\\n      seek for a remedy specific to any named disease and which he can thus\\n      apply almost automatically once he has made his organic diagnosis, which\\n      in quite an appreciable number of instances may ultimately be found to be\\n      wrong and so the treatment based upon it must therefore have been wrong.\\n      He does not, as is so often done, merely suppress the most outstanding\\n      symptom by an appropriate drug; for example giving an anodyne to mask the\\n      pain or removing the skin eruption by some strong local application, in\\n      other words putting the dust under the mat and pretending the room is\\n      clean.\\n      \\n Strangely enough the homoeopathic\\n      physician is often accused by his allopathic critic in his ignorance of\\n      Homoeopathy, of merely treating symptoms, whereas it is the critic himself\\n      who practices this superficial medicine. The homoeopathic physician, on\\n      the other hand, treats his patient as a whole through his symptoms and\\n      their modifications through changes in the environment, which is quite a\\n      different matter.\\n      \\n Homoeopathic therapy, unlike methods of\\n      treatment, is based on a natural law \"Similia Similibus\\n      Curentur\" \"Likes may be cured by likes\" which has been\\n      proved time and time again by experiment and which anyone with the will to\\n      do may prove for himself. It is not subject to constant change brought\\n      about by this or that latest discovery, and which itself will soon have to\\n      give way to the still later idea.\\n      \\n Having now introduced to you our actor,\\n      what of the scene in which he is to play his role?\\n      \\n This is the nineteen hundred and fifty\\n      - fourth year of the Christian era and the second year of the reign of our\\n      much loved and admired young Queen Elizabeth II, who will remember while\\n      in south Africa on her twenty - first birthday, before she had any idea\\n      that she would so soon be called to such an exalted position as she holds\\n      today, broadcast to the commonwealth and Empire her resolve to dedicate\\n      her life to the service of this grand community which dedication she\\n      recently repeated at her Coronation.\\n      \\n Here in Great Britain we have a more or\\n      less complete welfare state, with which idea some of us may very strongly\\n      disagree, whilst others believe such a development is the result of a\\n      natural very desirable social evolution.\\n      \\n As one necessary ingredient of this\\n      welfare state came, in 1948, the initiation of the National Health\\n      Service, through which the great majority of the population receives its\\n      medical attention, although it is rightly available to all.\\n      \\n When we come to consider the role that\\n      homoeo - therapeutics should play in this scheme, I would suggest that we\\n      should regard the problem from the purely medical aspect, forgetting any\\n      political party allegiances or sympathies we may have; or if we cannot\\n      forget them we should remember that the organization of the National\\n      Insurance Scheme of which the National Health Service is but a part, was\\n      first blue printed by the well - known Liberal supporter, Lord Beveridge,\\n      and the Health Service plans developed by the Coalition Government of all\\n      three major political parties.\\n      \\n We are living at present in an age\\n      which may very justifiably be regarded as a violent age in which have been\\n      developed so many appalling instruments of destruction, the use of some of\\n      which we are quite complacently accepting and from the use of others we\\n      are refraining, not because we consider them immoral, but simply through\\n      the fear of the wholesale destruction which would be caused by their use.\\n      We are seeing X-rays used in very high voltages in the treatment of\\n      cancer, we are being constantly remained of the use of dangerous drugs in\\n      medicine, without justification, in my opinion, bearing in mind the\\n      doubtful and evanescent ameliorations they produce and the violent\\n      surgical treatment of mental patients.\\n      \\n One further violence we should not\\n      forget is the way some of our foods are devitalized by the extraction of\\n      this or that portion of the natural product for purposes quite foreign to\\n      the well - being of the people who are to feed on them; or they are\\n      contaminated by the addition of this or that dangerous chemical, either\\n      during the growing of the plant, in the form of sprays, or as so called\\n      improvers in, for instance, the manufacture of white bread. It is very\\n      significant in this regard that quite a lot of attention is paid to the\\n      protection of the man who sprays the crops, but the right of the consumer\\n      to have uncontaminated food is slurred over by the unjustifiable statement\\n      that the amount of these chemicals so consumed is so small that it cannot\\n      have any bad effect on the consumer. We who practice Homoeopathy know how\\n      unwarranted is such a statement.\\n      \\n Can we homoeopathic physicians and\\n      patient hope to be able to do anything to make the still small voice of\\n      Homoeopathy heard in all this tumult, so that we may return to a saner and\\n      more healthful way of life and help our young Queen in her lifes work for\\n      the communitys sake?\\n      \\n Can we expect any help from the leaders\\n      of the medical profession? I am afraid not, because although I believe it\\n      accurate to state that there is a very slowly growing interest in, and\\n      tolerance of our work by individual doctors, the medical authorities are\\n      still, in their prejudice, strongly opposed to us. The London University\\n      still refuses to recognize our Hospital as a post - graduate teaching\\n      Hospital: the British Medical Association prohibits the formation of a\\n      homoeopathic section of its organization, and the Royal College of\\n      Physicians still refuses its membership to any one known as a homoeopathic\\n      physician. Yet in spite of this unfavourable environment, I firmly believe\\n      that there is a future for our method of therapeutics: but it will have to\\n      be pursued with courage, determination, foresight and energy. Surely if we\\n      believe as I do, that we are the guardians of a system of treatment\\n      destined to make our people healthier and therefore more efficient and\\n      happier, we would be failing in our duty to our country if we did not take\\n      every means in our power to acquaint the community at large with the\\n      advantages of this system and the dangers of ignoring it. This is a duty,\\n      not only of the profession, but also of the laity interested in\\n      Homoeopathy and who have experienced its benefits.\\n      \\n Every physician has two professional\\n      obligation to the community, that of preserving its health and that of\\n      endeavouring to restore it to being when it has fallen by the way.\\n      \\n The homoeopathic physician, thorough\\n      his knowledge acquired through the provings of drugs, even in\\n      infinitesimal doses, has, I believe, a very special responsibility as\\n      regards the prophylaxis of disease. It seems to me that a great deal of\\n      chronic ill health may quite conceivably be due to the manipulations of\\n      our foods and to the artificial manuring of the ground in which many of\\n      them are grown. Experiments have been carried our proving that plants\\n      grown in soil enriched by natural manuring, are much less prone to\\n      diseases than those grown with the help of artificial chemical manures. It\\n      seems a fairly justified conclusion that vegetables grown under these\\n      artificial conditions may quite well be deficient in something necessary\\n      for our perfect health. It is therefore incumbent upon the physician to\\n      advocate whenever possible the ingestion of healthily grown foods in the\\n      widest sense of that term.\\n      \\n The same duty applies when we consider\\n      the great amount of drugging in which the community at large indulges by\\n      its excessive smoking, particularly when aggravated by the practice of\\n      inhaling, and by the continued and prolonged use of drugs for this or that\\n      symptom, too often, unfortunately, though not always, on the prescription\\n      of their medical advisors.\\n      \\n There is a great lack throughout the\\n      community of any real enthusiasm for perfect health: we are only too prone\\n      to be content to follow like sheep, the unintelligent and harmful\\n      practices of the majority of our fellows.\\n      \\n Similarly in the curative realm, we\\n      homoeopathic physicians have special obligations.\\n      \\n When considering our position vis-a-vis\\n      the rest of the profession, we must never lose sight of the fact that our\\n      approach to the sick individual is a much broader and more comprehensive\\n      one than that of the dominant school. This latter prides itself on its\\n      scientific approach to its problems. One must, however, always be on ones\\n      guard against being hypnotized by that word scientific. The scientific\\n      aspect of any phenomenon or problem dealing with humanity is only one\\n      limited aspect of that problem. To get a complete picture one must\\n      consider other aspect, such as the aesthetic, emotional, maybe religious,\\n      and above all, perhaps one might say embracing all, the philosophical\\n      approach. This complex approach to his patients problem is the one that\\n      the homoeopathic physician always strives to adopt, and so never loses\\n      sight of the ego of the patient, while at the same time not forgetting his\\n      physical make - up.\\n      \\n Because this approach of ours to our\\n      patients is a much broader and more comprehensive one than the much\\n      vaunted scientific aspect, which the dominant school has come to regard as\\n      the Ultima Thule of medicine, I deplore the oft - repeated request of some\\n      of my colleagues that we should forsake our philosophy and make our work\\n      as scientific as theirs. I do not mean to imply by this that we should\\n      neglect the scientific angle of our patients illness but we should always\\n      remember that is only one facet of our problem. That is why we take such\\n      pains to diagnose our patients personality with his reaction to his\\n      environment in addition to the physical diagnosis of the case in order to\\n      arrive at our prescription for his malady. In other words, we should\\n      endeavour to lead our dominant school colleagues to our way of thinking,\\n      rather than that we should adopt theirs.\\n      \\n At the same time must always remember\\n      that if our philosophy should seem at any time to contradict so - called\\n      scientific laws, we must re - examine our philosophy, and if necessary\\n      modify it, while at the same time remembering that many times in the past\\n      what have been regarded as laws have ultimately been proved not to be so.\\n      Thus it is evident that we must never relax our self - examination.\\n      \\n What shall be the role of the\\n      homoeopathic laity?\\n      \\n The first thing for them to remember is\\n      that we are living in a democratic country whose government is dependent\\n      on the goodwill of the governed, and that, if a sufficient number of\\n      voters desire a certain line of action, that line will be adopted by the\\n      government.\\n      \\n The second thought is that there are\\n      not nearly sufficient doctors practising Homoeopathy in Great Britain to\\n      satisfy the present demand, let alone any further increased demand in the\\n      future, for this line of treatment.\\n      \\n Does not this seem strange, having\\n      regard to the great advantage to humanity that Homoeopathy provides? Not\\n      if one looks below the surface and so finds the reason for this shortage.\\n      \\n Surely the most potent reason is that\\n      Homoeopathy is not taught in the official Medical Schools, either as a pre\\n      - or post - graduate study. The London University when asked to recognize\\n      the Royal London Homoeopathic Hospital as a post - graduate Medical\\n      School, refused on the plea that as Homoeopathy was not taught in the\\n      undergraduate Medical Schools, it could not find a place for it in its\\n      post - graduate curriculum.\\n      \\n It is, of course, nonsense to suggest\\n      that a graduate should pursue his studies only in those subject of which\\n      he had already obtained some knowledge in his undergraduate days and\\n      should not wish to obtain information on any new or extra subject.\\n      \\n The University Medical Shools are\\n      enabled to a great extent through Government grants. We must therefore\\n      find some way of influencing whatever Government be in power to bring\\n      pressure to bear upon the London University to remove this obstacle to the\\n      better health of the community at large. I am quite satisfied that once\\n      this academic recognition is obtained we shave many more post - graduate\\n      students of Homoeopathy.\\n      \\n I believe than in a democratic\\n      community, having a universal State Medical Service, it is the bounden\\n      duty of the Government to remove all obstacles to the peoples obtaining\\n      that form of medical treatment in which they have confidence. So long as\\n      Homoeopathy is denied its legitimate status, so long must be Government be\\n      deemed to b failing in its duty to the country.\\n      \\n If, however, we are to achieve this\\n      desirable object of full recognition, we must all, professional and laity,\\n      be fired with enthusiasm, not only for the abstract cause of Homoeopathy,\\n      but for being partners with our young Queen in delicating our lives to the\\n      community.\\n      \\n When we do this we shall help to make\\n      this second Elizabethan era one to be remembered throughout the ages to\\n      come as surpassing the first Elizabethan era in that it gained not so much\\n      the economic and political leadership of the world - though that is not to\\n      be despised - but showed the way to the most healthful and spiritual way\\n      of life that all the world look notice and followed suit.\\n      \\n To sum up, the Role of Homoeopathy, as\\n      I see it, is to humanize the practice of medicine. By that I mean it must\\n      bring the practice of medicine into line with a reasoned philosophy of\\n      life, restore to it its artistry and rid it of all unnecessary hazards. It\\n      is to do this, not from any abstract academic sense of superiority, but in\\n      order the years to come are not those of merely another reign, but to\\n      ensure a veritable Renaissance, starting with the second Elizabethan era\\n      in which Great Britain will take its rightful place in the comity of\\n      nations as the pathfinder to a way of life for which posterity will be\\n      able to say \"Thank God for Queen Elizabeth the Second and her\\n      peoples.'\n",
      " 'Tresorie - Roentgenometric Pelvimetry [Roentgenometric Pelvimetry]\\n CHARLES W.PERKINS, M.D.\\n      \\n Norwalk, Conn\\n      \\n FOR some time the x-ray has been used\\n      to advantage in diagnosis of multiple pregnancy, position of fetus and\\n      fetal abnormalities. However, it has been only the past four or five years\\n      that any definite information has been obtained by roentgenographic\\n      methods of diagnoses in pelvimetry.\\n      \\n At the present time we are convinced\\n      that only by means of roentgenographs can be true proportions of the\\n      superior strait be determined, and that the ordinary external methods of\\n      Pelvimetry are not only occasionally misleading but proportionately\\n      inaccurate.\\n      \\n The present communication deals with\\n      the method of Herbert Thomas of Yale University. This method was developed\\n      in cooperation with the late Dr. W.A. Lafield, who was Professor of\\n      Roentgenology at the Yale Medical School.\\n      \\n Some of the reasons why roentgen\\n      pelvimetry has not been more universally adopted are probably due to the\\n      following factors.\\n      \\n (1) The majority of women will be\\n      delivered normally, whether or not pelvic measurements are made.\\n      \\n (2) The medical profession does not\\n      readily accept a new method after an established satisfactory routine has\\n      been in use.\\n      \\n (3) A new method of diagnosis incurs\\n      added expense.\\n      \\n (4) The present methods, although\\n      entirely speculative, are satisfactory in most cases.\\n      \\n (5) Roentgen pelvimetry cannot be\\n      performed by the obstetrician himself but requires the aid of a\\n      roentgenologist.\\n      \\n (6) The value of roentgenometric\\n      diagnosis is recent in origin and as yet not universally accepted.\\n      \\n If the knowledge of the size and shape\\n      of the pelvis is necessary to the practice of obstetrics, roentgen\\n      pelvimetry is a sound procedure, particularly in pre-emptors patients, and\\n      should and should be considered as an indispensable aid in these cases.\\n      \\n The method of Herbert Thoms as\\n      developed at Yale Medical School is not the only method. However, it can\\n      be classified as simple, accurate and rapid; being adaptable for use by\\n      other than experts in x-ray and obstetric diagnosis. As a technical\\n      procedure a well trained hospital technician can master its technic alter\\n      sufficient instruction.\\n      \\n Studies of recent years reveal the fact\\n      that external Pelvimetry fails to give uniform and accurate information in\\n      regard to the shape and size of the superior strait. This is often true of\\n      thin undersized individuals. In many patients of this type external\\n      measurements may suggest a contracted pelvis while the x-ray will show a\\n      relatively large pelvis with a subsequent natural labor and normal-sized\\n      child. On the other hand a stocky short person with similar external\\n      measurements will disclose a contracted pelvis which is an obstetric\\n      problem. Because of the apparent relationship between shortening of the\\n      transverse diameter and a secondary persistent occipito-posterior\\n      presentation, accurate information regarding this diameter is of clinical\\n      significance.\\n      \\n The observations of Thomas were made on\\n      twenty consecutive patients whose pelvis showed a relative or real\\n      shortening of the transverse diameter of the superior strait. In every\\n      instance a primary or secondary occipito posterior position was found\\n      after the patient was in labor. (Herbert Thoms, Surgery, Gynecology and\\n      Obstetrics, January, 1933). It therefore has been proved that an actual or\\n      relative shortening of a transverse diameter of the superior strait\\n      results in a limitation of space that is greater in the anterior than in\\n      the posterior half of the superior strait. Under these circumstances, when\\n      the head descends early in labor, the occiput is forced to rotate\\n      posteriorly.\\n      \\n The x-ray offers additional information\\n      in determining the size of the fetal head. It has been noted in x-ray\\n      examination of the unengaged fetal head that it lay with the transverse\\n      diameter of the superior strait, the occiput being either to the right or\\n      left; therefore, if roentgenogram of the patient is taken in the supine\\n      position with the fetus in the uterus, it will cast a shadow which is an\\n      enlarged profile of the head. The measurements of the occipital frontal\\n      diameter of the head can then be made. On numerous occasions this method\\n      of cephalometry, determining the diameter of the unmoulded head before and\\n      after cesarean section, has yielded accurate results. (Thomas, A.M.A.,\\n      February 24, 1934).\\n      \\n As experience increases in roentgen\\n      pelvimetry, the so-called labor test will be employed less. This, however,\\n      does not mean that the physician should not under estimate the importance\\n      of uterine contraction and the ability of the fetal head to mold. It has\\n      always followed that when something could be proved desirable in medicine\\n      for the better protection of the patient, such an advance would be\\n      demanded and eventually become routine. We may concede, therefore, that\\n      roentgen pelvimetry has a distinct place in the examination of every\\n      primiparous woman. In many instances, according to Thomas and others,\\n      external; measurements were normal but the x-ray examination revealed a\\n      contracted pelvis. On the other had, in certain patients whose external\\n      measurements suggested a cesarean section roentgen pelvimetry proved\\n      otherwise and they were subsequently delivered in a normal manner.\\n      \\n CENTIMETER GRID METHOD.\\n      \\n The procedure in this method may be\\n      summarized by stating the following:.\\n      \\n (1) The patient is placed on the\\n      roentgenographic table in the semi- recumbent position.\\n      \\n (2) The level of the superior strait\\n      above the sensitized film is established.\\n      \\n (3) The tube target is centered about\\n      five centimeters posterior to the symphysis, at thirty-two inches from the\\n      sensitized film, The exposure is made.\\n      \\n (4) The patient is removed from the\\n      table, the tube target and sensitized film remaining in situ.\\n      \\n (5) A lead plate, or centimeter grid,\\n      with perforations exactly one centimeter apart, is introduced into the\\n      same plane as that previously occupied by the superior strait and a second\\n      (flash) exposure is made on the same sensitized film as was used used in\\n      the previous exposure.\\n      \\n (6) Development of the film shows the\\n      outline of the superior strait and the shadows of the perforations, the\\n      assistance between which represents centimeters in the plane of the\\n      superior strait. The anteroposterior and transverse diameters of the\\n      superior strait in its use proportions may be drawn on centimeter-square\\n      paper by following the course of the shadow of the superior strait and\\n      transcribing it.\\n      \\n As this time I wish to express my\\n      thanks to Dr. Thoms for his personal advice and instruction which helped\\n      me to master the technic of his method.'\n",

      " 'Tresorie - THE EFFICACY OF THE VIBROMETER IN APPLYING VIBRATORY MASSAGE\\nIN AURAL DISEASES [Efficacy Of Vibrometer In Applying Vibratory Message In Aural\\nDisease]\\n\\n SINCE presenting my paper before the\\n      American Institute, in June of last year on \"Vibratory Motion as a\\n      Method of Massage in Aural Diseases,\" I have been using an instrument\\n      specially devised for that purpose called the \"vibrometer.\" This\\n      instrument is in shape like a banjo, and has four strings stretched across\\n      its length resting on a bridge, which sets upon a diaphragm. On each side,\\n      elevated above the diaphragm and supported by posts, are two horizontal\\n      bars, which support the mechanical appliances used for producing the\\n      various vibratory motions. This consists in what is called a yoke, in\\n      which revolves a shaft connected with the electro-motor by pulley-wheels\\n      and a belt. Behind the diaphragm is a shallow air-tight compartment,\\n      leading from which are rubber tubes that are inserted in the external\\n      auditory canal during treatment, consequently any vibratory motion of the\\n      diaphragm, which must necessarily be an inward and a corresponding outward\\n      movement, would be exactly reproduced upon the membrana tympani, as the\\n      confined air, not being able to escape, will undergo an alternate\\n      condensation and rarefication in the external auditory canal.\\n      \\n Every vibratory movement of the strings\\n      of the instrument is communicated to the diaphragm by means of the bridge\\n      upon which it rests. These strings by varying their tension and length can\\n      be regulated to give a high or low rate of vibration as desired, for\\n      instance, the heaviest string left at its original length adjusted to a\\n      slight tension may make about fifty vibratory motions to the second, while\\n      the highest string on the instrument adjusted to a high tension and\\n      clamped down to one-fourth its original length would probably make three\\n      thousand vibratory motions to the second.\\n      \\n In the centre of the diaphragm is an\\n      attachment which works on a lever, and when hit by the cam on the\\n      revolving shaft lifts the diaphragm to a considerable extent, causing a\\n      powerful effect on the membrana tympani. This attachment can be adjusted\\n      at four different leverages, which causes a modification or increase of\\n      its intensity and can be regulated at from one to twenty-five vibratory\\n      movements to the second. This is only used in very bad cases and for not\\n      more than five minutes continuously.\\n      \\n The instrument which I have been\\n      describing in an improvement on the first manufactured, and as far as I\\n      know, is the only one which offers the same facilities for applying this\\n      method of massage. The class of patients in my experience who are\\n      generally benefited from the first, are those in which the mucous membrane\\n      lining the tympanic cavity and Eustachian tubes is in a hypertrophic\\n      condition. The membrana tympani are depressed, opaque, and thickened. They\\n      usually complain of a stiffed sensation in the ears, with a great deal of\\n      tinnitus aurium, and that their hearing is worse during a cold. In cases\\n      where the mucous membranes are atrophied with a large external auditory\\n      canal perfectly dry and Eustachian tubes patulous, and generally very\\n      little tinnitus, this or no other treatment has done very much good in the\\n      majority of cases, and in looking ever my records I find that only about\\n      five per cent. have been relieved, while in the before-mentioned cases the\\n      good results reach at least seventy-five per cent. In treating persons, I\\n      always select the rate of vibration which corresponds in pitch, if\\n      possible, to that caused by the diseased condition of the ears. If there\\n      is no tinnitus to guide me, I find whether the patient can hear a high or\\n      low sound better; if it is a low sound, a high rate of vibration is used\\n      in treatment, and vice versa, A point which I would like to explain here\\n      is this: It is not necessary that the sound from the instrument should be\\n      of the same quality of the tinnitus experienced by the patient, but merely\\n      the same pitch. for instance, if a banjo, where one of the strings was\\n      adjusted when sounded to produce a certain note, and a musical instrument\\n      of any other kind, whose quality of tone was entirely different, was made\\n      to sound the same note in a room, the string on the banjo would vibrate in\\n      sympathy, which has been proven by experiment, any other note, no matter\\n      how loud, would have no effect. Another point is in the way the strings of\\n      the vibrometer are set in motion. On the revolving shaft is a wheel\\n      projecting from which are metallic picks which hit the string it is\\n      adjusted over. It does not make any difference in the number of vibratory\\n      motions per second, whether the string is hit fast or slow, but at the\\n      time the string is first hit the intensity is greater than it is just\\n      before being hit again, and as the motion of the wheel is perfectly\\n      rhythmic, revolving so many times to the second, it has just as good an\\n      effect as if the intensity during the fraction of a second did not vary at\\n      all. The idea of using vibratory motion, as I have said before, originated\\n      within my mind some years ago, and later put into practical operation, and\\n      as far as I know, was the first to lay before the profession in a\\n      scientific manner, this method of massage.\\n      \\n I have found that when two of the\\n      strings upon the vibrometer were regulated in such a way that when both\\n      were set in vibration at the same time, producing the sensation of a\\n      harmonious sound, the effect in some cases on the tinnitus was especially\\n      beneficial, relieving, where the various kinds of vibrations produced by a\\n      single string failed. Sub-acute cases of deafness, accompanied by tinnitus\\n      aurium, are quickly relieved, as the following case will illustrate:.\\n      \\n Mrs. M. Young, married lady, aet. 26,\\n      called at my office, April 1, 1893, complaining of partial deafness and\\n      tinnitus aurium. She had a stuffed sensation, or as if cotton had been\\n      packed in the external auditory canal. She says the tinnitus was so\\n      annoying as to prevent sleep. On examination, found considerable\\n      retraction of the membrana tympani, and hearing for the watch, on the\\n      right side five inches, on the left, seven inches. The Eustachian tube\\n      were partially closed, which made inflation somewhat difficult, giving\\n      slight relief. I used several of the vibrations on the different strings\\n      without immediate benefit.\\n      \\n April 4th.-She came again, and reported\\n      that no improvement had taken place. I again inflated her ears, after\\n      which she sat down to the vibrometer. The central attachment was used with\\n      considerable force continuously for four minutes, after which she declared\\n      that the tinnitus had entirely ceased in the right ear, and greatly\\n      modified in the left; the hearing for the watch had increased for both\\n      ears to fourteen inches, and the stuffed sensation had almost entirely\\n      disappeared. On inspection of the membrana tympani, found them\\n      comparatively very slightly retracted. On April 8th, found improvement had\\n      continued, when the same treatment was used for three minutes; after which\\n      she declared herself completely relieved of the tinnitus and stuffed\\n      sensation, with hearing powerfully restored. Saw her again on April 13th,\\n      when she declared the good results from last treatment to have still\\n      continued.\\n      \\n I find that in the majority of cases,\\n      when the strings of the instrument are used it is only necessary to strike\\n      them lightly with the friction wheel. In vibrating the heavy string, I\\n      generally set the bridge back behind the central attachment, and adjusting\\n      the motor in such way that the belt is at a considerable tension, so that\\n      the pulley-wheel revolves slowly. I also generally use this adjustment\\n      when setting in motion two strings at one time. The principle of this\\n      method of treatment embraces two essential features which to my mind makes\\n      this system of massage the only scientific one applicable to the membrana\\n      tympani and its associate sound-conducting parts. Message is the\\n      application of motion to disease, and its scientific administration\\n      consists of its application in a systematic manner. In applying massage in\\n      aural diseases, it is necessary to produce a to-and-fro movement of the\\n      membrana tympani, and, if possible, by a force which is harmless and at\\n      the same time effective. The vibrometer fulfils these conditions. Any of\\n      the strings on the instrument that may be set in motion by the\\n      friction-wheel, will produce a certain number of vibratory movements to\\n      the second of time, and the movements of the central attachment are also\\n      measured. What could be more systematic than this? The motions of the\\n      membrana tympani were intended by nature to its vibratory, and as the\\n      vibrometer generates measured motion, and these motions are vibratory,\\n      theoretically we have a scientific and effective method of massage in\\n      aural diseases; and, as demonstrated practically by the use of the\\n      vibrometer, we have in fact a great scientific advance over all previous\\n      methods. Since the introduction of this treatment in aural diseases, it\\n      makes possible a more or less benefit in cases of deafness heretofore\\n      considered hopeless, and has opened up the field for the treatment of\\n      aural diseases to such an extent that the number of deaf patients seeking\\n      relief at the aurist\\'s hands will at least double itself.\\n      \\n DISCUSSION.\\n      \\n H.C. HOUGHTON, M.D.: Dr. Garey\\'s\\n      admirable paper gives us the description of the vibrometer, an instrument\\n      devised under his personal direction and inspection, for the purpose of\\n      applying massage to the ear. It is the only instrument of the kind on the\\n      market, so far as I am aware, and after a somewhat prolonged use of it, I\\n      am prepared to recommend the latest production of the vibrometer company.\\n      \\n This instrument is a decided\\n      improvement over the instrument first sent out, and is capable of\\n      producing a most profound effect upon the drum-head and ossicula; indeed,\\n      upon the entire auditory apparatus. I am able to confirm Dr. Garey\\'s\\n      statement of the effect of high and low vibrations us regards treatment.\\n      \\n I have also been very much interested\\n      in the use of stringed or reed instruments for diagnosis, and find that we\\n      can detect any abnormal sensitiveness of the auditory nerve to high or low\\n      tones. Some patients are extremely sensitive to all tones, high or low;\\n      others to high tones and not to low tones; others, conversely. Again, in\\n      some instances, there is a peculiar sensitiveness to single tones or to\\n      discords produced by sounding the note and half-note at the same time.\\n      Under the action of the central attachment of the vibrometer this\\n      sensitiveness is modified, the sensitiveness to high tones disappearing\\n      and being replaced by a low tone or, conversely, under treatment, a low\\n      tone disappears and a high tone is established, temporarily, at least.\\n      Again, in cases of recent origin, treatment will substitute an undefined\\n      rushing sound for a definite musical tone, either high or low, and later,\\n      the treatment will abolish this, the patient being relieved of this\\n      intensely annoying symptom. In some cases, with this relief, there is an\\n      improvement in the audition; in other cases, no improvement follows.\\n      \\n I confess to the domination of the\\n      material over my mind in my earlier experience with massage, and I think\\n      the inclination of operators will be to use a far greater degree of power\\n      than is necessary. I therefore notice with great satisfaction Professor\\n      Garey\\'s remark that \"the object should be to produce a to-and-fro\\n      motion to the membrana tympani, and, if possible, by a force which is\\n      harmless and at the same time effective.\" I would hardly say\\n      \"to-and-fro motion of the drum-head,\" because I think that the\\n      expression is liable to perpetuate the motion which is fixed in the minds\\n      of most physiologists, that the drum-head moves as a whole, with a\\n      to-and-fro motion.\" That is true under the influence of the Politzer,\\n      Siegle\\'s otoscope and similar instruments; but it certainly does not so\\n      move in the ordinary function of audition, but stands as the iris does in\\n      the eye, as an adjustor, a regulator of sound-force; in some sense as the\\n      iris does in its relation with the lens, to adjust, regulate and direct\\n      the essential force, and the vibration of the drum-head is at every node;\\n      every portion receives impressions that are converted into molecular\\n      disturbances of varying lengths, according as they are produced upon the\\n      stiff and unyielding portions of the drum-head at the periphery, along the\\n      manubrium, or in the more attenuated and easily-yielding portions which\\n      the between these two areas. Not only so, but these impulses are\\n      communicated to the contained air of the tympanum, and make their\\n      impression upon the acoustic nerve through the round window synchronously\\n      with the impression made through the ossicula.\\n      \\n This whole subject widens before my\\n      mind in such a way that one might wish himself twenty years and at liberty\\n      to devote himself to a term of research in acoustics, such as is offered\\n      only in the technical schools of the continent of Europe.\\n      \\n WM. R. KING, M.D.: In discussing Dr.\\n      Garey\\'s paper I shall begin by saying that his methods have been closely\\n      followed by me since the beginning of his experiments, owing to the fact\\n      that I have been greatly interested in the treatment of deafness and\\n      tinnitus by means of sound waves or by aural massage since 1887, and have\\n      experimented and treated many cases by this method since then, though with\\n      crude and unsatisfactory instruments. Since using the vibrometer-which,\\n      after much study and experimentation, is now presented to the profession\\n      in practical shape-I have undoubtedly increased my percentage of good\\n      results.\\n      \\n I don\\'t believe I am over-sanguine or\\n      carried away by interest in this method, and believe I can rightly\\n      appreciate that this does not offer us a panacea or cure-all for auditory\\n      ailments, and hope I may always be ready to see the failures and to strive\\n      to find methods or remedies to reach some of them.\\n      \\n In speaking of the application of the\\n      instrument, I wish to call attention to the central attachment or post foe\\n      vibrations. Dr. Garey has not given it as much attention in the paper as\\n      it deserves. It is very useful as a general means of aural massage,\\n      rougher in nature and more general in application than the strings which\\n      help to make up the instrument. I often use it before applying the\\n      \"similar found\" to a given case, as a species of gymnastics, to\\n      stimulate secretion and motion in the conducting apparatus of the ear,\\n      viz., membrana tympani and ossicles. In most cases-in fact, in all-where\\n      tinnitus is present, I follow this up immediately by the nearest approach\\n      to the similar pitch obtainable.\\n      \\n I agree thoroughly with Dr. Garey, that\\n      the best results are achieved in cases accompanying hypertrophic catarrh,\\n      and that the least benefit is apparent in cases of atrophic nature.\\n      \\n Regarding the method of treatment in\\n      the absence of tinnitus, my experience the does not coincide with that of\\n      the author of the paper entirely; I do not feel that as yet we have any\\n      safe rule to guide us. My method has been to try the numerous sounds and\\n      variations the of until I find the one that seems to give the best\\n      immediate results, or that the patient himself will speak of as very\\n      penetrating and powerful )though not necessarily loud and heavy).\\n      \\n It seems almost impossible at present\\n      to simulate all the qualities of tone as they occur in the ears of those\\n      suffering with tinnitus; in fact, it would appear to be unnecessary.\\n      However, it seems advantageous and quite necessary to secure the closest\\n      simulation of pitch, thus in many cases soon obliterating annoying\\n      tinnitus and improving hearing powers.\\n      \\n The arrangement permitting of the\\n      picking of two strings simultaneously adds decidedly the usefulness of the\\n      instrument, as it increases the range of pitch as well as varying the\\n      quality of tones procurable, thereby decidedly enlarging our field of\\n      application.\\n      \\n The force used for creating the message\\n      or gymnastics of the membrana tympani and the ossicles-viz, vibratory\\n      force or sound- carefully and scientifically applied, is nature\\'s remedy,\\n      because it is adapted by nature, and is the only force which can rightly\\n      or safely be applied to these delicate portions of this complex organ of\\n      hearing.\\n      \\n A startling commentary on this subject\\n      is the array of cases benefited who have been relegated to the shelf by\\n      ancient and modern otology; cases declared unhelpable have been vastly\\n      improved. Pray, make no mistake; I did not say all cases.\\n      \\n It may be interesting to hear the\\n      latest regarding the instrument which was first invented for the\\n      application of this method of aural massage Mr. E.J. Godman, the inventor\\n      and patentee, is constantly on the lookout, and always striving for\\n      improvements to his machine. He has made many that you all know of. Permit\\n      me to report a few so recent they have not yet left the factory.\\n      \\n First.-The machine has been taken from\\n      its case, and is now mounted on a solid stand or table of oak, being set\\n      below the level, or so that the face of the instrument is just level with\\n      the face of the table. This is all supported by rigid, solid metal legs,\\n      which absolutely prevent foreign vibrations.\\n      \\n Second.-The motor has been removed from\\n      its little shelf and relegated below the table. I t can be placed upon a\\n      box on the floor, a shelf against the wall, or, better yet, a shelf\\n      solidly attached to the metal supports of the table. A belt goes up\\n      through an aperture to a wheel on a shaft, the other extremity of which\\n      carries a wheel with a rubber tire (a friction wheel), which in its\\n      revolution, being in contact with a larger flat- surfaced wheel on the\\n      main shaft of the instrument, turns this in harmony with itself. This\\n      arrangement does away with the necessity of shifting the motor each time\\n      you wish to shift the carriage from one string to another- a consummation\\n      to be devoutly thankful for. The removal of the motor from the instrument\\n      as at present attached will recommend itself to all who have used the\\n      vibrometer, a great amount of undesirable jar being thus avoided.\\n      \\n Third.-Ratchet keys capable of very\\n      fine adjustment of tension of strings are now provided for the instrument.\\n      \\n Fourth.-A rheostadt or resistance-coil\\n      is now to be placed beneath the table between the storage battery and the\\n      switch, by this means enabling us to control the speed and number of\\n      revolutions to a nicety.\\n      \\n Other, though comparatively minor,\\n      improvements are being made, and others are contemplated, as, for\\n      instance, the substitution of a roughly corrugated rubber band for the\\n      picker on the wheel, thereby getting rid of the metallic sound of the\\n      picker on the wire strings.\\n      \\n I have experimented with a number of\\n      appliance for the production of the sounds and pitches that I have\\n      required, but I always fall back on the vibrometer, especially as at\\n      present constructed, for satisfactory work and results.\\n      \\n This instrument may be, and probably\\n      is, as yet, in its infancy. It, and the method it applies, can only be\\n      perfected by constant work and experimentation both on the part of the\\n      profession and of the manufacturers. Each improvement we can suggest, if\\n      it only should serve as a means of helping one solitary case, would be\\n      well worth our while.\\n      \\n The experiments being made by different\\n      methods for treating deafness by sound waves is indicative of the interest\\n      the profession has taken in the matter. It is indicative of a lack of\\n      something in our usual armamentarium which is greatly longed for by\\n      patient and doctor; that is, the means for making the deaf hear and for\\n      relieving distressing tinnitus. There has been a dearth in this direction,\\n      and perhaps there still is, but I believe fully that we have in aural\\n      massage by vibratory force a decided acquisition at our hands.\\n      \\n E. H. LINNELL., M.D.: I would simply\\n      like to ask Dr. King how long he uses the instrument, and whether he uses\\n      it according to the deafness.\\n      \\n DR. KING: Yes, decidedly. In an intense\\n      case of deafness I would have to use it a great deal longer. The central\\n      attachment I never carry over three or five minutes, and the whole\\n      treatment I don\\'t think is over carried over twenty or twenty-five minutes\\n      in one case, and usually averages from ten to fifteen.\\n      \\n HAROLD WILSON, M.D.: I have only to\\n      suggest, what I have elsewhere called attention to, the possibility of\\n      another mechanical device for securing vibratory motion. It is well known\\n      that in the make and break of a current of electricity, in the circuit of\\n      which there is a telephone, we get an influence upon the make and break of\\n      the current in the telephone. Now, it is a simple matter with which these\\n      makes and breaks are made as to obtaining any number of vibration that you\\n      wish. You may, by a mechanical device of some rotary motion, if you\\n      choose, make and break the current as rapidly as you please until you have\\n      reached several thousand vibrations a second, or you may even make the\\n      vibrations so slow us to be easily counted. The application of this\\n      suggestion has been put in force in my own practice, more or less, in the\\n      use of the telephone as connected with the induction-coil ordinary\\n      battery. The more intense the current, the more intense the sound. You can\\n      easily see that it is mere question of mechanics to secure these two\\n      sounds-intensity of vibration and rapidity of vibration. I will say,\\n      furthermore, that it has this advantage. There is no noise in the office,\\n      which I think is not altogether true of the vibrometer. I would suggest\\n      that so far as the vibrometer is concerned, if it could be made to be\\n      noiseless to anybody but the patient, it would be a decided improvement.\\n      In that respect the telephone is a decided improvement, because there is\\n      no noise except to the patient, because the noise is right at the ear of\\n      the patient. If I were seeking for a perfected instrument in this line, I\\n      would go outside of the banjo idea. As we have the most perfect writing\\n      machines, which have no connection with the ordinary method of writing,\\n      and sewing machines, which have no connection with sewing by hand, so it\\n      occurs to me that possibly the securing of he vibratory motion upon the\\n      ears might be obtained in a totally different way from that which you get\\n      when you listen to the drum of the guitar or an ordinary musical\\n      instrument, and I would suggest that the make and break of a telephone\\n      open a very fruitful field for mechanical experimentation.\\n      \\n H.C. HOUGHTON, M.D.: In my study of\\n      this subject I made the acquaintance of Mr. Bernhardt, of New York City,\\n      who is a personal friend of Mr. Emil Berliner, the inventor of the Emil\\n      Berliner Telephone, which is the instrument by which the Bell Telephone\\n      Company maintain their monopoly at present. Mr. Berliner is the inventor\\n      of the graphophone, and has, I think, covered this whole matter which Dr.\\n      Wilson has mentioned. As ordinary Bell telephone receiver is put into the\\n      circuit of an ordinary induction machine, and you can use it just as the\\n      English people use the audiometer, and as you remove the coil you modify\\n      the vibrations, which is covered with another disk and a tube, and that\\n      tube covered with a stethoscope tube, which is the same as we use for the\\n      phonograph or vibrometer, and, as Dr. Wilson has suggested, you can modify\\n      the intensity, and of course the whole matter is adjusted by the\\n      attachment of the cord, so that you can have fine vibrations. The\\n      intensity of the vibrations is regulated by the distance to which you\\n      uncover the cord. The only difficulty in the adjustment is that it has\\n      been so severe that it is really uncomfortable, and the noise of the\\n      instrument is reduced to the minimum for office use.\\n      \\n A.B. NORTON, M.D.: I will also add that\\n      in regard to the objection Dr. Wilson makes to the noise, there is no\\n      doubt it is an annoying thing in the office, and in that line I have some\\n      men at work on my suggestion. We are devising another machine, or\\n      instrument, which is to be entirely enclosed in a cabinet, so there will\\n      be no noise whatever in the room if it is made a success. The idea is a\\n      little crude, and I am quite uncertain whether it will amount to anything\\n      or not. Then, in the line of what Dr. King was speaking in regard to Mr.\\n      Goodwin-he called, at New York, to see me last week. I made two little\\n      suggestion to him, which I think would be in line with his advancement.\\n      One is the number of the picks. The present vibrometer has four picks I\\n      suggest the experiment of trying twelve or sixteen picks, which will make\\n      a more continuous sound; it may be of some value. Then, in regard to\\n      regulating the speed of the machine: you regulate that now by a series of\\n      buttons, so as to get three different speeds. We will have a very slight,\\n      intermediate speed, and a very rapid speed. My experience with the\\n      vibrometer is especially favorable. I think the idea is in the right\\n      direction, and it is simply a matter of instrumentation.']\n",
