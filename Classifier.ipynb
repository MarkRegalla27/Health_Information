       "['Lactobacillus acidophilus is a member of the Lactobacillus genus of bacteria. These bacteria can be found in the mouth, intestine, and vagina. L. acidophilus is thought to benefit health, since it produces vitamin K and lactase. However, L. acidophilus cannot make many other vitamins and amino acids. Because of this, L. acidophilus is mostly found in the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract where there are higher amounts of these nutrients.L. acidophilus is commonly used in food, such as yogurt, other dairy products, and fermented soy products, such as miso and tempeh.L. acidophilus is one of the most commonly used probiotics, microorganisms that are used to promote health. Probiotics are different from prebiotics, which are complex sugars that may support the growth of \"good\" bacteria in the intestinal tract. The word \"synbiotic\" means that a product has both a probiotic and a prebiotic.There is good evidence for the use of L. acidophilus in treating vaginal infections. However, there is unclear evidence for other medicinal uses of L. acidophilus, such as in irritable bowel syndrome, brain disorders, asthma, high cholesterol, lactose digestion, or diarrhea.Although it is thought to be safe with few side effects, L. acidophilus by mouth should be avoided in people who have intestinal damage, immune problems, or an overgrowth of bacteria in the intestines. These people may have a higher risk of having the bacteria leave the GI tract and possibly cause multiple organ failure. There have been reports that some Lactobacillus species, such as L. rhamnosus and L. casei, may be involved in infections, such as abscesses, meningitis, and septic arthritis.',\n",
       " 'Clear gel from the aloe leaves has been applied to the skin to treat wounds, skin infections, burns, and for many other skin conditions. Dried latex from the aloe leaf has been taken by mouth traditionally as a laxative.There is good scientific evidence for use of aloe latex as a laxative. However, it is unclear if it is better than other therapies for constipation. A report of liver toxicity from ingesting aloe raises a question of safety.Aloe may benefit genital herpes, inflammatory skin conditions, and dandruff. For numerous other conditions, aloe has an unclear or lack of benefit.',\n",
       " \"Creatine is normally found in meat and fish. Creatine is also naturally made in the human body in the kidney and liver. Creatine is mainly stored in muscles, but about 1.5-2% of the body's creatine is converted to creatinine daily.The finding that carbohydrates enhance muscle creatine uptake increased the market for creatine sports drinks. Oral consumption of creatine increases the creatine in muscle, which serves to regenerate adenosine triphosphate (ATP).Creatine supplementation became popular in the 1990s for enhancing athletic performance and building lean body mass. It has also been used in the treatment of chronic heart failure and mitochondrial disorders.Overall, creatine appears to have modest benefits for intense, repetitive exercise lasting less than 30 seconds. It does not appear to have significant benefits on endurance aerobic exercise.Caffeine may counteract the benefit of creatine on intermittent exercise performance. Furthermore, creatine in combination with caffeine and ephedra may have adverse effects. However, more research is needed in this area to confirm these interactions.\",\n",
       " \"Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is a hormone that comes from the adrenal gland. It is also made in the brain. DHEA leads to the production of androgens and estrogens (male and female sex hormones). DHEA levels in the body begin to decrease after age 30. Levels decrease more quickly in women. Lower DHEA levels are found in people with hormonal disorders, HIV/AIDS, Alzheimer's disease, heart disease, depression, diabetes, inflammation, immune disorders, and osteoporosis. Corticosteroids, birth control taken by mouth, and agents that treat psychiatric disorders may reduce DHEA levels.Evidence suggests that DHEA may help treat depression, obesity, and osteoporosis. However, more research is needed to support its use for hormonal disorders, sexual function, and lupus (an autoimmune disorder that affects the skin and organs). DHEA has been studied for the treatment of HIV, schizophrenia, and severe injury.DHEA may cause side effects related to other hormones. Women may experience symptoms such as oily skin, increased unnatural hair growth, a deep voice, irregular periods, smaller breast size, and increased genital size. Men may experience breast tenderness, urinary urgency, aggression, or reduced size of the testes. Other side effects that may occur in either sex include acne, sleep problems, headache, nausea, skin itching, and mood changes. DHEA may also affect levels of other hormones, insulin, and cholesterol. Safety information is lacking on the long-term effects of DHEA. DHEA may increase the risk of prostate, breast, and ovarian cancers. It is not suggested for regular use without a health professional's care.\",\n",
       " 'Dong quai is also known as Chinese angelica. It belongs to the same plant family as parsley, celery, carrots, and poison hemlock. Dong quai has been used for thousands of years in traditional Chinese, Korean, and Japanese medicine. It is one of the most popular plants in Chinese medicine.Dong quai has been called \"female ginseng\" because it is commonly used for health conditions in women. The plant has been used for menstrual cramps, anemia associated with menstruation, pregnancy, premenstrual syndrome (PMS), pelvic pain, recovery from childbirth or illness, and fatigue or low energy. Dong quai is used in both men and women for heart conditions, high blood pressure, inflammation, headache, infections, and nerve pain.It has been suggested that dong quai has weak estrogen-like effects. However, it remains unclear whether dong quai has the same effects as estrogens, blocks estrogen activity, or lacks significant hormonal effects.Dong quai is often used in combination with other herbs for liver and spleen problems. It is thought to work best in people who have a calm, reserved profile, and is thought to be a mildly warming herb. Dong quai is believed to help nourish the blood and balance energy.There is little human evidence to support the medical use of dong quai. Dong quai has been studied for many conditions, including absent menstrual periods, arthritis, blood circulation, brain disorders, heart disease, immune problems, and sexual dysfunction. More high-quality research is needed to confirm the use of dong quai for any condition.',\n",
       " 'Echinacea species belong to the aster family (Asteraceae) that originated in eastern North America. Of the nine identified species, only three are used as medicine. The roots and herbs of the species have been studied for potential immune benefits.Echinacea has been taken by mouth in Europe and the United States to help prevent or treat the common cold. In the United States, echinacea sales are thought to make up 10 percent of the dietary supplement market. Although much research has been done on the potential cold-fighting effects of echinacea, results are conflicting. There have been reports of a lack of benefit and rash caused by echinacea in children.Early studies looking at the potential benefits of echinacea for herpes and radiation poisoning have found a lack of evidence. Applying echinacea juice to the skin has been suggested for wound healing, and taking echinacea by mouth or injecting it has been suggested for vaginal yeast infections. However, clear evidence is lacking in these areas.Echinacea use has been discouraged in people who have autoimmune disease. However, more research is needed before further conclusions can be made.',\n",
       " 'In 2003, there was a death of a U.S. major league baseball pitcher which was thought to be related to ephedra. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has collected more than 800 reports of serious toxicity, including more than 22 deaths. On February 6, 2004, the FDA issued a rule prohibiting the sale of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids (ephedra). This rule was issued because supplements with ephedra present a serious risk of illness or injury.In 2005 this rule was struck down in Utah but reversed again four months later. Ephedra is currently banned throughout the United States. It remains unclear whether ephedra will re-appear on the market, despite serious safety risks, including heart events or death.Ephedra sinica, a species of ephedra (ma huang), contains ephedrine and pseudoephedrine. Ephedra has been found to stimulate the nervous system, increase airflow into the lungs and constrict blood vessels. In combination with caffeine, ephedra appears to cause weight loss. However, effects of ephedra or ephedrine monotherapy have been mixed. Ephedrine has been widely studied for asthma and low blood pressure. However, quality research of commercial supplements with ephedra is lacking.Major safety concerns have been associated with ephedra or ephedrine use, including high blood pressure, increased heart rate, nervous system excitation, irregular heartbeat, heart attack, and stroke.',\n",
       " \"Native Americans traditionally considered the evening primrose plant's seeds, leaves, and roots to be a food. They also used the plant to treat bruises or wounds, hemorrhoids, stomach problems, and sore throats.Oil extracted from evening primrose (Oenothera biennis) plant seeds consists of a high amount of unsaturated fatty acids. These fatty acids include omega-6 fatty acids, linolenic acid, and gamma-linolenic acid (GLA). GLA has been licensed for treating breast pain and eczema in numerous countries.Evening primrose oil (EPO) has been studied for several disorders, particularly those affected by metabolic products of essential fatty acids. There is good scientific evidence to support EPO for eczema treatment.\",\n",
       " 'Flaxseed and flaxseed oil (or linseed oil) are rich sources of the essential fatty acid alpha-linolenic acid (ALA). In the body, some ALA is converted to omega-3 fatty acids.Lignans are a type of plant hormone similar to estrogen. The lignan components of flaxseed (not flaxseed oil) may possess antioxidant properties and alter estrogen activity.As a source of fiber, flaxseed (not flaxseed oil) has laxative properties. In large doses, or when taken without enough water, flaxseed may cause bowel obstruction. The effects of flaxseed on blood sugar levels are unclear.Flaxseed oil contains only the ALA component of flaxseed and not the fiber or lignan components. Therefore, flaxseed oil may share the potential cholesterol-lowering properties of flaxseed, but not the proposed laxative or anticancer abilities.',\n",
       " 'Folate and folic acid are forms of a water-soluble B vitamin. Folate occurs naturally in food, and folic acid is the synthetic form of this vitamin. Folic acid is well-tolerated in amounts found in fortified foods and supplements. Sources include cereals, baked goods, leafy vegetables (spinach, broccoli, lettuce), okra, asparagus, fruits (bananas, melons, lemons), legumes, yeast, mushrooms, organ meat (beef liver, kidney), orange juice, and tomato juice. Folic acid is frequently used in combination with other B vitamins in vitamin B complex formulations.Folic acid supplements are effective for increasing folate levels in blood and decreasing symptoms associated with low folate levels. Folic acid supplementation, with and without other B vitamins, reduce levels of homocysteine in blood (a cardiovascular risk factor).Folic acid supplements are suggested for use in women of childbearing age in order to prevent neural tube defects. Neural tube defect risk appears to have decreased in many countries since folic acid fortification of flour and cereals.Folic acid is also of interest with respect to cognitive enhancement, cancer, psychiatric illnesses, and cardiovascular conditions, although conclusions may not be drawn for many of these uses at this time. Some concern exists with respect to increased folic acid intake masking symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency, especially in the elderly population.',\n",
       " 'Ginkgo biloba has been used medicinally for thousands of years. Today, it is one of the top-selling herbs in the United States.Ginkgo is used for the treatment of numerous conditions, many of which are under scientific investigation. Available evidence supports ginkgo for managing dementia, anxiety, schizophrenia, and cerebral insufficiency (insufficient blood flow to brain).Evidence for other uses is either lacking or mixed. Further research is needed for all uses of ginkgo.Although ginkgo is generally well tolerated, it should be used cautiously in people with clotting disorders or taking blood thinners, or prior to some surgical or dental procedures, due to reports of bleeding.',\n",
       " 'Glucosamine is a compound that is naturally made in humans. It is involved in the creation of molecules that form cartilage.Evidence supports the use of glucosamine sulfate in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis. It is believed that the sulfate portion may help strengthen cartilage. If this is confirmed, it would mean that the glucosamine sulfate form is more effective than glucosamine without sulfate.Glucosamine is often taken together with chondroitin, which comes from cartilage. The use of integrative therapies like glucosamine is often seen in people with osteoarthritis. These treatments may help reduce doses of drugs such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs).Glucosamine has also been studied for possible benefits on wound healing, skin conditions such as psoriasis, and the prevention of migraine. More research is needed in these areas.Research shows that glucosamine is well tolerated for up to three years. However, people who are allergic to shellfish should avoid using it.There have been concerns about the effects of glucosamine on insulin and blood sugar. However, some recent studies suggest that glucosamine may not affect these measures. This remains an area of controversy.',\n",
       " 'L-arginine was first isolated in 1886, reportedly from the extract of a lupine (Lupinus spp.) seedling. Lupinus is a genus in the legume (Fabaceae) plant family.Arginine is an amino acid normally made by the body. Arginine is also found in many foods that have protein.Arginine becomes nitric oxide (a blood vessel-widening agent called a vasodilator) in the body. Early evidence suggests that arginine may help treat medical conditions that improve with increased vasodilation. These conditions include chest pain, atherosclerosis (clogged arteries), heart disease, heart failure, erectile dysfunction, peripheral vascular disease, and headaches from blood vessel swelling).Arginine also triggers the body to make protein and has been studied for healing wounds, bodybuilding, enhancing sperm production, and preventing tissue wasting in people with critical illnesses. However, caution is warranted. Arginine use was associated with death in some people with heart conditions. Caution is also needed when using arginine to treat pre-eclampsia (high blood pressure in pregnancy).Arginine hydrochloride has been used to treat metabolic alkalosis. This use should be under the supervision of a qualified healthcare professional.',\n",
       " \"Honey is a sweet fluid made by honeybees from the nectar of flowers. It is generally safe, but there have been reports of certain toxic types of honey made from plants from the Rhododendron genus and others.Honey is easy for the body to absorb and use. It contains about 70-80 percent sugar. The rest is water, minerals, and some protein, acids, and other substances. Honey has been used for wounds, skin problems, and various diseases of the stomach and intestines.The antibacterial effects of honey are well-known. Research has been done on the role of honey in long-term wound management, as well as the treatment of ulcers, burns, Fournier's gangrene (a life-threatening bacterial infection), and diabetes. However, more high-quality studies are needed to make firm conclusions on the use of honey.\",\n",
       " 'Lycopene is a bright red pigment that is naturally found in the human liver, serum (blood), adrenal glands, lungs, prostate, colon, and skin at higher levels than other similar pigments. In animal studies, lycopene has been found to have antioxidant effects and may also block cancer cell growth. However, there is still controversy over whether it has these effects in humans.Many studies suggest that eating lycopene-rich foods or having high lycopene levels in the body may be linked to reduced risk of cancer, heart disease, and age-related eye disorders. However, measures of lycopene intake have been based on eating tomatoes, not on the use of lycopene supplements. Since tomatoes also contain other nutrients, such as vitamin C and potassium, the potential benefits of lycopene alone are still unclear.Lycopene deficiency is not considered a medical condition. There is a lack of evidence on whether increasing low lycopene levels may benefit health.',\n",
       " 'Melatonin is a hormone produced in the brain by the pineal gland from the amino acid tryptophan. The production and release of melatonin are stimulated by darkness and decreased by light, suggesting that melatonin is involved in circadian rhythm (the internal body clock) and regulation of diverse body functions. Levels of melatonin in the blood are highest prior to bedtime.The most common use of melatonin is to aid in sleep. The strongest evidence supporting the use of melatonin is for delayed sleep phase syndrome, insomnia in children and the elderly, jet lag, and sleep problems in people with behavioral, developmental, or mental disorders. The weakest evidence in support of melatonin is for work shift sleep disorder. Good evidence in support of melatonin for other uses is lacking.New drugs that block the effects of melatonin are being developed. These include BMS-214778 and luzindole, and they may have uses in various disorders.',\n",
       " 'Milk thistle has been used medicinally for over 2,000 years, most commonly for the treatment of liver and gallbladder disorders. Silymarin comes from the seeds of milk thistle and is believed to be the active part of milk thistle. The terms \"milk thistle\" and \"silymarin\" are often used interchangeably.Milk thistle products are popular in Europe and the United States for various types of liver disease. Although numerous human trials have been published, most studies have lacked a strong design and strong conclusive evidence.Milk thistle has been well tolerated with mild side effects when used in a recommended amount and duration.',\n",
       " 'Vitamin B3 is made up of niacin and niacinamide, and can be found in many foods, including yeast, meat, fish, milk, eggs, green vegetables, and cereal grains. Vitamin B3 is often found in combination with other B vitamins, including thiamine, riboflavin, pantothenic acid, pyridoxine, cyanocobalamin, and folic acid.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved niacin for use in treating vitamin B3 deficiency (pellagra), which includes symptoms of skin inflammation, dementia, and diarrhea.Human research has shown that niacin is effective and relatively safe for treating high cholesterol levels. Limited evidence shows that niacin may help with clogged arteries and heart disease. Side effects commonly related to higher doses of niacin are itching, flushing, and stomach upset. Niacin may also cause liver problems, increased blood sugar, and hormone changes.',\n",
       " 'SAMe is made in the body from a reaction between methionine, which is an essential amino acid, and adenosine triphosphate, a molecule that carries energy. SAMe is involved in many different reactions in the body.SAMe has been used to treat psychiatric illnesses, infertility, liver problems, premenstrual disorders, and musculoskeletal conditions.SAMe has been widely studied for osteoarthritis and depression. There is evidence that SAMe may help reduce the pain of osteoarthritis.Some evidence is available for the use of SAMe for depression, fibromyalgia, and bile flow problems during pregnancy. SAMe has also been studied for its potential anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving effects. However, higher-quality studies are needed before conclusions can be made.',\n",
       " 'Beta-carotene is a carotenoid. Carotenoids are red, orange, or yellow, fat-soluble compounds. These compounds are naturally present in many fruits, grains, oils, and vegetables. Alpha, beta, and gamma carotene are considered provitamins because they can be converted to active vitamin A.Commercially available beta-carotene is man-made or taken from palm oil, algae, or fungi. Beta-carotene is converted to retinol, which is essential for vision and growth.Studies in humans show that beta-carotene has promising use for oral leukoplakia (pre-cancerous mouth lesions) and for sunburn. However there was a lack of benefit for sun damaged skin, mole prevention, heart disease risk, infection with H. Pylori, cataract prevention, diabetes, and stroke.Research shows that beta-carotene increased the risk of bladder, lung, stomach, and prostate cancer. Also the general incidence of cancer in asbestos workers, smokers, or high risk individuals increased. Additionally, some research suggested increased risk of heart disease and death with beta-carotene supplementation.',\n",
       " \"Extracts of Hypericum perforatum L. (St. John's wort) have been recommended traditionally for a wide range of medical conditions. The most common modern-day use of St. John's wort is for depression. Studies have shown St. John's wort may be equally effective as tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants for mild to moderate depression.Overall, the evidence suggests St. John's wort may be effective for in mild-to-moderate depression. The evidence for severe depression remains unclear.St. John's wort may cause serious interactions with prescription drugs, herbs, or supplements. Therefore, people using any medications should consult their healthcare providers, including a pharmacist, prior to starting therapy.\",\n",
       " \"Tea tree oil comes from the leaves of Melaleuca alternifolia. Tea tree oil is thought to have antiseptic properties and has been used to prevent and treat infections.Other traditional uses of tea tree oil include treatment of fungal infections (including fungal infections of the nails and athlete's foot), dental health, parasites, skin allergic reactions, and vaginal infections. In addition, there is evidence supporting tea tree oil use for acne; however, further research is needed.Tea tree oil should not be taken by mouth; there are reports of toxicity after consuming tea tree oil by mouth. When applied to the skin, tea tree oil is reported to be mildly irritating and has been associated with the development of an allergic skin reaction, which may limit its potential as an agent for the skin in some people.\",\n",
       " 'Thiamine (also spelled \"thiamin\") is a vitamin, formerly known as vitamin B1. Thiamine was one of the first compounds recognized as a vitamin.Thiamine is involved in many body functions, including nervous system and muscle function, the flow of electrolytes in and out of nerve and muscle cells, digestion, and carbohydrate metabolism. Very little thiamine is stored in the body and depletion can occur within 14 days. Severe thiamine deficiency may lead to serious complications involving the nervous system, brain, muscles, heart, and stomach and intestines.Dietary sources of thiamine include beef, brewer\\'s yeast, legumes (beans, lentils), milk, nuts, oats, oranges, pork, rice, seeds, wheat, whole-grain cereals, and yeast. In industrialized countries, food made with white rice or white flour is often enriched with thiamine.Thiamine is used as part of a treatment for metabolic disorders and thiamine deficiency symptoms, as well as in alcoholics. It has been studied for other uses, but conclusions are lacking at this time.',\n",
       " 'Vitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin that comes from two sources: preformed retinoids and provitamin carotenoids. Retinoids, such as retinal and retinoic acid, are found in animal sources such as liver, kidney, eggs, and dairy products. Carotenoids, such as beta-carotene (which has the highest vitamin A activity), are found in plants such as dark or yellow vegetables and carrots.Natural retinoids are present in all living organisms, either as preformed vitamin A or as carotenoids, and are required for biological processes such as vision and cellular growth. A major biologic function of vitamin A (as the metabolite retinal) is in the visual cycle. Research also suggests that vitamin A may reduce death from measles, prevent some types of cancer, aid in growth and development, and improve immune function.Recommended dietary allowance (RDA) levels for vitamin A oral intake have been established by the U.S. Institute for Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences to prevent deficiencies in vitamin A. At recommended doses, vitamin A is considered nontoxic. Excess dosing may lead to short or long-term toxicity.Vitamin A deficiency is rare in developed nations but remains a concern in developing countries, particularly in areas where poor nutrition is common. Prolonged deficiency can lead to xerophthalmia (dry eye) and ultimately to night blindness or total blindness, as well as to skin disorders, infections (such as measles), diarrhea, and lung disorders.',\n",
       " 'Vitamin B12 is an essential water-soluble vitamin that is commonly found in a variety of foods, such as fish, shellfish, meat, eggs, and dairy products. Vitamin B12 is frequently used in combination with other B vitamins in a vitamin B complex formulation. Vitamin B12 is important in DNA synthesis. Vitamin B12 is bound to the protein in food. Acid in the stomach releases B12 from protein during digestion. Once released, B12 combines with a substance called intrinsic factor (IF) before it is absorbed into the bloodstream.The human body stores several years\\' worth of vitamin B12 in the liver, so low levels in the body are rare. Decreases in vitamin B12 levels are more common in the elderly, HIV-infected persons, and vegetarians. Inability to absorb vitamin B12 from the intestinal tract can cause a type of anemia called pernicious anemia. Fever and symptoms of \"excessive sweating\" have been reported with anemia due to low levels of vitamin B12; however, these are fixed with vitamin B12 treatment.',\n",
       " 'Vitamin B6 is also called pyridoxine. It is involved in the process of making serotonin and norepinephrine, which are chemicals that transmit signals in the brain. Vitamin B6 is also involved in the formation of myelin, a protein layer that forms around nerve cells.Vitamin B6 deficiency in adults may cause health problems affecting the nerves, skin, mucous membranes, and circulatory system. In children, the central nervous system is also affected. Deficiency can occur in people with kidney failure complications, alcoholism, liver scarring, overactive thyroid, problems with absorbing nutrients, and heart failure, as well as those taking certain medications. Mild deficiency of vitamin B6 is common.Major sources of vitamin B6 include cereal grains, legumes, vegetables (carrots, spinach, peas, and potatoes), milk, cheese, eggs, fish, liver, meat, and flour. Vitamin B6 is often used with other B vitamins in vitamin B complex formulas.High blood levels of the amino acid homocysteine may be a risk factor for heart disease. Taking vitamin B6 supplements with other B vitamins (folic acid and vitamin B12) has been shown to be effective for lowering homocysteine levels.Vitamin B6 has been studied for the treatment of many conditions, including anemia (low amounts of healthy red blood cells), vitamin B6 deficiency, certain seizures in newborns, and side effects of the drug cycloserine. Evidence in support of other uses is lacking.',\n",
       " 'Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is a water-soluble vitamin, which is needed by the body to form collagen in bones, cartilage, muscle, and blood vessels. Dietary sources of vitamin C include fruits and vegetables, particularly citrus fruits such as oranges.Severe deficiency of vitamin C causes scurvy. Although rare, scurvy results in severe symptoms and can cause death. People with scurvy are treated with vitamin C and should be under medical supervision.Many uses for vitamin C have been proposed, but evidence of benefit in scientific studies is lacking. In particular, research on asthma, cancer, and diabetes remains inconclusive, and a lack of benefit has been found for the prevention of cataracts or heart disease.The use of vitamin C in the prevention or treatment of colds remains controversial. Extensive research has been conducted. Overall, vitamin C lacked an effect on the development of colds and on cold symptoms. However, the duration of the cold shortened slightly. Notably, people living in extreme circumstances, including soldiers in the subarctic, skiers, and marathon runners, had a 50% decrease in the risk of developing a cold. This area merits additional research and may be of particular interest to athletes or people in the military.',\n",
       " 'Vitamin D is found in many foods, including fish, eggs, fortified milk, and cod liver oil. The sun also adds to the body\\'s daily production of vitamin D, and as little as 10 minutes of exposure is thought to prevent deficiency.The term \"vitamin D\" refers to several different forms of this vitamin. Two forms are important in humans: vitamin D2, which is made by plants, and vitamin D3, which is made by human skin when exposed to sunlight. Foods may be fortified with vitamin D2 or D3.The major role of vitamin D is to maintain normal blood levels of calcium and phosphorus. Vitamin D helps the body absorb calcium, which forms and maintains strong bones. It is used alone or together with calcium to improve bone health and decrease fractures. Vitamin D may also protect against osteoporosis, high blood pressure, cancer, and other diseases.Rickets and osteomalacia are classic vitamin D deficiency diseases. In children, vitamin D deficiency causes rickets, which is a softening or weakening of the bones. In adults, vitamin D deficiency can lead to osteomalacia, which causes weak bones and muscles. People who may be at a high risk for vitamin D deficiency include those who are elderly or obese, those with limited sun exposure, and babies who are exclusively breastfed. People who have conditions such as cystic fibrosis (mucus build-up in the lungs) or inflammatory bowel disease are also at risk for vitamin D deficiency.',\n",
       " 'Vitamin E is a fat-soluble vitamin with antioxidant properties. Vitamin E exists in eight different forms: alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-tocopherol; and alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-tocotrienol. Alpha-tocopherol is the most active form in humans.Dosing for vitamin E is often given in alpha-tocopherol equivalents (ATEs). This accounts for the different activities that the different forms of vitamin E have in the body. One milligram of an ATE is equal to 1.5 international units (IU).Vitamin E supplements are available in natural or man-made forms. The natural forms are usually labeled with the letter \"d\" (for example, d-gamma-tocopherol), whereas synthetic forms are labeled \"dl\" (for example, dl-alpha-tocopherol).Foods that contain vitamin E include eggs, fortified cereals, fruit, green leafy vegetables (such as spinach), meat, nuts, nut oils, poultry, vegetable oils (corn, cottonseed, safflower, soybean, sunflower), argan oil, olive oil, wheat germ oil, and whole grains. Cooking and storage may destroy some of the vitamin E in foods.Vitamin E has been studied for the prevention or treatment of many health conditions. However, there is a lack of strong evidence to support its use for any disease at this time, aside from vitamin E deficiency.Concerns have been raised about the safety of vitamin E supplementation, particularly in high doses. An increased risk of bleeding may occur in people taking blood thinners, or those with vitamin K deficiency. Evidence suggests that regular use of high-dose vitamin E supplements may increase the risk of death from all causes by a small amount, although research is unclear. Caution is advised.Vitamin E has also been studied for scar prevention. However, there is a lack of evidence to support this use. Because of a risk of allergic skin symptoms, some researchers have advised against the use of this therapy.',\n",
       " 'Black cohosh is popular as an alternative to hormonal therapy in the treatment of menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes, mood disturbances, excessive sweating, palpitations, and vaginal dryness. Several studies have reported black cohosh may improve menopausal symptoms for up to one year, although the evidence is mixed.The mechanism of action of black cohosh remains unclear. Research suggests that there may be no direct effects on estrogen receptors, although this is an area of active controversy.Safety and efficacy beyond one year have not been proven. Reports suggest the safety of short-term use, including in women with menopausal symptoms for whom estrogen replacement therapy is not suggested. Nonetheless, caution is advised until better-quality safety data are available. There have been reports of liver damage and higher lead levels in the blood from black cohosh. Use of black cohosh in high-risk populations (such as in women with a history of breast cancer) should be under the supervision of a licensed healthcare professional.',\n",
       " 'Milk is made up of two major types of proteins, the casein class and the whey class.Whey proteins contain higher levels of essential amino acids. They are used in ice cream, bread, soup, baby formula, and other food products.Whey protein products can be processed in a number of ways. The finished products often have different levels of protein, sugars, minerals, and fat.Whey protein is an easily digested source of protein. It is also a popular protein supplement for improving immune function and muscle strength. It is also used to help prevent heart disease, diabetes, and bone loss.There is good evidence to support the use of whey protein for relieving allergy symptoms, reducing appetite, and providing protein. There is fairly good evidence to support its use for improving blood sugar levels, enhancing muscle mass and strength, and promoting weight loss. More research is needed to confirm these findings.',\n",
       " \"Cocoa and chocolate come from the cacao bean. Cacao is native to South America and has been grown in the tropics for at least 3,000 years. The African country Ivory Coast is the one of the largest suppliers of raw cocoa.Cocoa products have been considered delicacies by many cultures. Cocoa contains flavonoids, which are compounds with antioxidant effects, blood thinning properties, and possibly other health benefits. For this reason, and because it is so popular, chocolate is widely researched.Chocolate has been studied for heart disease, skin conditions, constipation, and various other conditions. The strongest evidence exists for cocoa's ability to decrease blood pressure.\",\n",
       " 'Chondroitin sulfate is a molecule that is found naturally in the body. It has mostly been used to treat joint disorders, such as osteoarthritis, and problems with the chewing muscles and joints.Clinical trials on the use of chondroitin for osteoarthritis have found promising results. However, most of the studies are conducted for less than two years. Adequate assessment of long-term safety, side effects, and effectiveness is lacking.Early evidence suggests that chondroitin sulfate may improve the absorption of iron and measures of coronary artery disease. However, more research is needed in these areas.',\n",
       " \"Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is an antioxidant that is made in the human body. CoQ10 is needed for basic cell function. CoQ10 levels decrease with age and may be low in people with cancer, certain genetic disorders, diabetes, heart conditions, HIV/AIDS, muscular dystrophies, and Parkinson's disease. Some prescription drugs may also lower CoQ10 levels.CoQ10 in the body can be increased by taking CoQ10 supplements. There is evidence that idebenone, a man-made compound similar to CoQ10, may help treat Alzheimer's disease. However, evidence is lacking to support the use of CoQ10 itself for this condition. There is some evidence to support the use of CoQ10 for high blood pressure and heart failure.Promising uses of CoQ10 include eye disease, chest pain caused by exercise, asthma, chronic fatigue, and high cholesterol, as well as the treatment of chemotherapy side effects in children.Evidence is conflicting for the use of CoQ10 in heart muscle problems and exercise performance. There is some negative evidence for the use of CoQ10 in the treatment of diabetes, hepatitis C, and Huntington's disease.\",\n",
       " 'There is some human evidence supporting the use of cranberry juice and cranberry supplements to prevent urinary tract infection (UTI), although most available studies are of lesser quality. Clear dosing guidelines are lacking, but given the safety of cranberry, it may be reasonable to recommend the use of moderate amounts of cranberry juice cocktail to prevent UTI in non-chronically ill individuals.Cranberry has not been shown effective as a treatment for documented UTI. Although cranberry may be used as an adjunct therapy in some cases, given the proven efficacy of antibiotics, cranberry should not be considered a first-line treatment.Cranberry has been investigated for numerous other medicinal uses, and promising areas of investigation include prevention of H. pylori infection, which causes gastrointestinal ulcers and dental plaque.']"

      "[u'Tresorie - Application of homoeopathic Principles in of Mental States\\n[Application Of Homoeopathic Principles In The Treatment Of Mental States]\\n Middletown, N.Y.\\n      \\n THE object of this paper is to reveal\\n      and evaluate homoeopathic principles in the treatment of mental reactions.\\n      Such an approach is being practiced at the Middletown State homoeopathic\\n      Hospital where our observations were made. In this paper we will also\\n      bring forth the observations and conclusions arrived at by others as to\\n      the effects of certain homoeopathic remedies in the treatment of certain\\n      mental states. As Dr. Talcott once wrote, \"The means used for the\\n      recovery of patients are numerous and varied. We cannot pin our faith to a\\n      single measure. We week to adopt all which experience has proved likely to\\n      be beneficial.\" It will be out chief aim to show just what\\n      homoeopathic remedies are most effective in mental disease, the principles\\n      behind their administration, and to stress in what way they are effective.\\n      There is no absolute way of gauging the value of our procedure accurately\\n      except by statistical corelations which, of course, do not mean much\\n      because of the numerous actors and variables. Such variables as the\\n      introduction of other treatment methods and other factors and\\n      relationships which cannot be controlled. make it too difficult a task to\\n      evaluate the drug per se. However, we will include a few statistical\\n      accumulations for those who may wish to make comparisons.\\n      \\n The material for this paper comprises\\n      the personal observations and studies made of the authors own cases and we\\n      present only a few of our cases to illustrate our remarks.\\n      \\n Homoeopathy is a method of drug\\n      therapeutics and plays only a small part in treatment of disease. Other\\n      methods, especially in mental disease, are of greater importance than\\n      drugs, and are so recognized by used. Such means which we refer to as\\n      hygienic, which includes regulation of diet and regimen of patient, habit\\n      training, rest and seclusion, choice of environment, cleanliness,\\n      kindness, proper education diversion; occupational therapy; psychotherapy\\n      of all sorts; use of various forces of nature, such as employment of water\\n      in various forms, referred to as hydrotherapy; application of electricity,\\n      light rays, heat, grouped under physiotherapy, are employed by us.\\n      Endocrinotherapy, vaccine therapy, together with allopathic drugs which\\n      have been found palliative or specific are given wherever indicated. They\\n      are not being undervalued, but rather excluded from our consideration as\\n      we are concerned here with the value of homoeopathic drugs in the\\n      treatment of mental disorders.\\n      \\n Briefly, homoeopathy can be defined as\\n      a therapeutic method formulated in the \"similia similibus\\n      curentur\" principle-let likes be treated by likes. The two elements\\n      of comparison implied in the above statement are the effects if drugs on\\n      the healthy body and the clinical features of disease, in either case,\\n      both the subjective elements of the disease which is appreciated by the\\n      patient as well as the objective manifestations as observed by the\\n      physician being taken into account. Medicines administered on this plan\\n      are usually single and in small doses, at least below the generally\\n      accepted pharmacologic and so-called physiologic dose. It is a method, not\\n      a doctrine or a system. It is a therapy complete in itself and independent\\n      of the allied sciences of physiology and pathology so far as these consist\\n      of changing doctrines and conceptions. It is a practical method, or\\n      organon, as its originator Hahnemann used it for effecting in the best\\n      manner a certain end, namely, the cure of disease.\\n      \\n Application of an agent which produces\\n      in a healthy individual the symptoms similar to those found in a specific\\n      disease process was recognized by Hippocrates and others.\\n      \\n Hippocrates stated that disease was\\n      cured through a method of treatment which contracts it and a method where\\n      the disease of treatment which counteracts it and a method of treatment\\n      which counteracts it and a method where the disease is removed through\\n      remedies which produce similar symptoms to the disease. We find that\\n      before Hahnemann seized this principle as a general basis, tested and\\n      worked out this thought and formulated it as a rule for medical practice,\\n      physicians were treating vomiting with an emetic, preparations of organs\\n      of animals were given for disorders of the same organ in man, application\\n      of heat to burns, acid to acidity of stomach, etc. Nowadays actually these\\n      two principles of Hippocrates for representing remedy finding have been\\n      successful. Sometimes both of these principles, although through different\\n      thought process, lead to the same remedy. For instance, in one school of\\n      thought mercury is given to oppose the action of a bacillary dysentery by\\n      destroying the cause, in the other case the drug is given because it\\n      produces a similar picture in a healthy person when given in large doses,\\n      but its deadening effect is removed when given in small doses for then it\\n      stimulates the resistance, defensive and curative powers of the organism\\n      against the disease. Parenthetically, we may insert the fact that it has\\n      been shown, for instance, in case or adrenalin, by Renty, and others, that\\n      adrenalin dilates rather than constricts in 1/1000, but in the more dilute\\n      forms it stimulates the vessels by constriction.\\n      \\n There are three recognizable kinds of\\n      actions possessed by drugs which can be referred to as mechanical,\\n      chemical and dynamic, respectively. It is in this last chemical and\\n      dynamic, respectively. It is in this last class of action of drugs that\\n      homoeopathy works its rule of similia. If we avail ourselves of the\\n      mechanical or chemical properties of substances, we do so on mechanical\\n      and chemical principles. On the other hand, the dynamic principle which is\\n      here involved depends on there being a changed physical state which gives\\n      a substance energy to reach and affect tissues. Drug energy, no drug\\n      material, is dealt with. The drug mass by its division and agitation\\n      energizes the super imposed menstrum (alcohol or sugar) which, when taken\\n      into the body, stimulates suitable tissues.\\n      \\n The next principles is important so far\\n      as psychiatry is concerned and that is the doctrine of the totality of\\n      symptoms which includes the entire reactions of the patient, both\\n      subjective and subjective The totality of symptoms, including the\\n      sufferings, feeling, reactions of the patient the general and local\\n      manifestations of the disease, constitutes the disease. General and local\\n      manifestations of the disease, constitutes the disease. General and local\\n      symptoms constitute only a small part in the total picture. This concept\\n      enables us to treat maladies in their formative state, in state of\\n      subjective experiences before the pathologic process has progressed to\\n      state of physical diagnosis. We know that early states and recognizable\\n      mainly by symptoms of subjective nature. This concept is taken into\\n      cognizance in the general medical aphorism, \"Treat the patient, not\\n      the disease.\" This holds especially true in mental disease where we\\n      get the reactions of the patient to the disease before the latter is\\n      discernible. Our chief goal is, therefore, to cover the totality of\\n      symptoms. This doctrine fits in very well with the concept of the total\\n      personality. We must restore the normal integrated pattern in all its\\n      aspects, and should not treat the diseased element along. That is what we\\n      try to do in using was referred to as hygienic measures.\\n      \\n Our therapeutics are biologically based\\n      not entirely on cause, but on organismal reactions, that is on the\\n      reactions of human beings as a whole to the situations confronted, on the\\n      physical make-up, the constitution, the functional alterations, the\\n      pathologic state, the causative factors, presence or absence of past\\n      causes both predisposing and exciting, the mental symptoms, reactions of\\n      the organism to environment, in short and complete picture of the diseased\\n      state in a particular individual. By so coordinating the relationship\\n      between the diseased state and drugs effect and by individualizing the\\n      case, the smaller is the effective dose which is necessary, so that there\\n      is no chance of doing any harm. The smallest amount of the agent that will\\n      prove effective is administered.\\n      \\n An important keynote in our prescribing\\n      is the individualization of the case. A study of the special factors that\\n      differentiate two cases of the same disease from one another as well as a\\n      study of the disease itself is important. Such a differentiation is\\n      necessary in homoeopathic prescribing. It is not sufficient to stop with\\n      the classifications of the diseased state as an entity. Not all\\n      individuals are alike in form, functional response, mental and physical\\n      make-up, psychologic reactions, etc. This has been shown by Draper and\\n      others who have studied the constitutional make up associated with\\n      diseases. We cannot expect dissimilar individuals to react in the same way\\n      to same causative agent of diseases. One individuals to react in the same\\n      way to same causative agent of diseases. One individual is sensitive to a\\n      certain drug whereas another tolerates it.\\n      \\n One can readily see how difficult it\\n      would be in mental disease with all its variegated number of mental\\n      symptoms, to uncover a \"similimum\" which would cover he\\n      \"totality of symptoms.\" Although each case has its own\\n      individuality, there are basic uniform manifestations in a single disease\\n      or drug group, which are common to the disease or group of drugs. For\\n      instance, in a case of general paralysis there are certain basis subject\\n      and objective symptoms. In the same fashion, a group of drugs give base\\n      symptoms referable to the predilected tissues. The determinative symptoms\\n      which distinguish one cases of a certain disease from another or\\n      differentiate one drug from another in a certain group, are complex in\\n      mental states. We depend, there fore, on a certain group of drugs covering\\n      certain disease states, following which we abstract from the diseased\\n      state in a particular individual as many determinative symptoms as we can\\n      and try to fit them with a drug in the particular group whose pathogenesis\\n      closely approximates the symptoms we have abstracted.\\n      \\n Another important concept is the\\n      correlation of mental disease with physical illness. This was recognized\\n      by homoeopathic therapeutists for some time and they emphasized the metal\\n      symptoms produced by the drug more than they did the physical symptoms.\\n      Nux vomica, for instance, is beneficial in hypochondriasis, melancholia,\\n      out of proportion to dyspepsia, weight being placed on the mental angle.\\n      We at Middletown feel that by concentrating on the physical angle in a\\n      patient no matter what psychosis he has, we will modify the severity of\\n      his mental reactions and in some cases evoke a cure. We therefore search\\n      diligently for all physical disturbances, both general and local, and\\n      treat any by homoeopathic and other methods.\\n      \\n The Phrase \"likes are treated with\\n      likes\" embodies as aspect of the remedial agent and an aspect of the\\n      disease. It is therefore important to know the general action of the\\n      medicinal agent, the particular tissues or functions upon which it acts.\\n      Nux vomica has an especial affinity for the sensory side of the central\\n      nervous system. Alcohol the toxin has a similar affinity; therefore in\\n      alcohol cases nux vomica is most often indicated.\\n      \\n As already implied, there is no\\n      necessity on the part of the homoeopathic prescriber to make a study of\\n      medicines in themselves prior to their application to practice. The\\n      pathognomonic effects have been ascertained and recorded. We have but to\\n      refer to such a record after we have examined our patient to discover the\\n      similimum in his case. The closer we approximate the individual to the\\n      drug giving similar pathologic effects in a similar type of healthy\\n      individual the more chance we have for cure. Hence, the arrangement of\\n      pathogenesis as will be noticed in the form of a schema of disconnected\\n      symptoms.\\n      \\n We will now give you a few of the\\n      drugs, with emphasis upon their mental manifestations, from which we\\n      deduce the type of case in which they are valuable. It is not intended to\\n      form any a priori notion of the medicine or to see in its effects any true\\n      picture of disease. It simply may be applicable in one type individual\\n      with, let us say, manic-depressive and not in another type of individual\\n      with the same disease. We will also draw in a few of our own cases as\\n      illustrations.\\n      \\n Let us commence with our manic\\n      excitements. Talcott stated that out choice commonly lay between three\\n      mydriatics: belladonna, hyoscyamus and stramonium. He advocated belladonna\\n      in those cases where there was marked hyperemia, sudden explosions of rage\\n      and fury, restlessness and destructiveness. Hyoscyamus he gave in those\\n      cases that had tendency to expose their person.\\n      \\n We have in mind a case where the\\n      patient was given a hypo of hyoscine hydrobromide and who had symptoms.\\n      \\n Butler also recommenced belladonna in\\n      intense mental excitement with treatment with great violence and\\n      destructiveness against everything within reach. We have used this remedy\\n      rather extensively in such cases as described above. More particularly\\n      when there is a flushed face, dilated pupils, rapid flow of ideas,\\n      emotional instability frequent emotional shifts from an irritable, angry\\n      state to one of euphoria and elation. This drug we can verify is certainly\\n      the most common one used in manics.\\n      \\n Hyoscyamus is frequently used at\\n      Middletown State Hospital. Here the symptoms are restlessness of pressure\\n      of ideas and activity, continuous state of elations, obscenity, eroticism\\n      and tendency to expose the body.\\n      \\n In the most intense form of excitement\\n      we have used Stramonium.\\n      \\n Our findings to the efficacy of these\\n      drugs cannot be truly evaluated, due to the introduction of other forms of\\n      control of the excitement. We will later introduce statistical data, but\\n      in view of such data we can say that out better results are due for one\\n      thing to the absence of morphine, hyoscine or any other sedative. We\\n      believe the injudicious use of morphine and hypnotics in excitements is\\n      injurious. Its supply increases the state of cerebral excitement that\\n      already exists. We flood the system with large doses which disturb the\\n      normal structures, let along the pathologic structures. It has been shown\\n      that 1/4 gr. morphine will produce acidosis lasting one to four hours; a\\n      small dose will produce alkalosis. This would add to the acidosis already\\n      existing in cases of excitement. We add fuel to the fire. As in the case\\n      of chronic brain disease, an acute organic delirium is a summation of\\n      effects. In pure acute delirium either psychogenic or organic, what\\n      results is a summation of effects. In our acute psychogenic excitement we\\n      have found that those cases that have some organic state, such as heart\\n      conditions. are more apart to have an acute organic delirium superimposed\\n      upon the functional delirium when hypnotics are administered. The\\n      following case is a good example.\\n      \\n H.McC., aged fifty-two, diagnosed mixed\\n      manic, third attack, third admission, white male; a lawyer by profession.\\n      History of many attacks of rheumatism, rejected during the war for cardiac\\n      condition. Three weeks before admission here, he spoke incessantly, was\\n      hyperactive, violent. Sedatives were given to quiet him and he came here\\n      November 9, 1934, with a mixture of psychogenic and organic features. The\\n      latter were disorientation, marked incoherence and confusion, varying\\n      levels of consciousness, speech defect, content of occupational character,\\n      preservation, all in all an engrafted acute organic delirium. In two days\\n      the entire picture subsided and was replaced by retardation, memory\\n      defects, weeps spells, sadness and difficulty in organization of his\\n      thoughts. He made the following comments the following week. \"If I\\n      take something to make me sleep, it is very bad. When I come out of the\\n      drug, there is a hazy, uncertain confusion, excitement and bad dreams.\\n      Ever since I was a kid, Ive noticed that in every illness when I took a\\n      drug to produce sleep, either during during the effect of the drug or\\n      after the drug wears off, there is a delirious state. I havent any such\\n      states since Ive been here and youll note I havent asked you what drug you\\n      were giving me although all my life either I have been told or I would\\n      naturally ask.\" He went home recovered the first of this year, having\\n      been a fine shape for over a mouth previously, Here the drug given was\\n      cactus gran. The symptoms of depression which set in following the\\n      excitement together with the sensation of weight on his brain plus\\n      frightening spells at night plus the cardiac constricting sensation,\\n      fitted this remedy.\\n      \\n It is clear that in these functional\\n      cases where there is a physical organic factor, the cerebral cortex is\\n      more sensitive to hypnotics. It is the same mechanism that we find in\\n      organic brain disease or in chronic toxic infectious processes where the\\n      brain is in state of chronic irritation and thereby reacts violently to\\n      hypnotics. The following is a good illustration of a chronic toxemia set\\n      up by endogenous and exogenous toxins culminating in an acute cerebral\\n      excitement upon administration of morphine and hyoscine. In this case the\\n      fundamental reactive pattern was a psychoneurotic one.\\n      \\n E.G., white, female, aged fifty-one,\\n      married, has three children. Had several illness in her adulthood\\n      influenza, pneumonia and appendicitis. In July 1933, she contracted\\n      rheumatic fever. She was a neurotic personality who became very impatient\\n      with the protracted course of her illness. For two months she received all\\n      sorts of treatment from any number of physicians including chiropractors.\\n      For two weeks before admission she received an ampoule of hyoscine and\\n      morphine daily, and three days before admission here july 2, 1933, she was\\n      delirious.\\n      \\n She was brought into the hospital with\\n      a typical acute organic delirium. Our summary of the case was as follows.\\n      \"We have here an intense psychoneurotic reaction caused by a disease\\n      process, the latter having been maltreated. Mixed up and superimposed on\\n      the type of reactive pattern is an acute delirium prepared by the\\n      predisposing factor, that is, endogenous toxins emanating from the\\n      arthritic focus; and excited by exogenous toxins, morphine, hyoscine and\\n      twenty other varieties of anodynes, sedatives, hypnotics and chologogues,\\n      etc. The delirium cleared up in a few days; the hysterical outbursts and\\n      drug craving were satisfied by hypos of sterile water; the rheumatic\\n      disease plus the mental signs of apprehension and fears and the hysterical\\n      outburst of shrieks of pains called for rhus tox. Patients organismal\\n      reaction improved far greater than the arthritic focus, which remained as\\n      short of a hysterical conversion symptom, but this ultimately cleared up\\n      so that she sat up out if bed within two weeks and was home in a\\n      month.\"\\n      \\n In pure functional manic depressives we\\n      make no claims whatsoever; whatever results are obtained are probably due\\n      to the psychologic factor, the satisfaction of psychic craving, suggestion\\n      and whatever mechanism it many be depending on the case.\\n      \\n A previously stated in our handling of\\n      mental cases we pay especial attention to the physical facts. We do not\\n      use homoeopathic means exclusively to combat the physical condition but we\\n      resort to any treatment which we feel will help. We give our specific\\n      drugs for their antagonistic actions if they have been proved successful.\\n      we give palliative drug such as amyl nitrite in angina pectoris, and we\\n      use other forms of therapy. In cases with a physical condition, if we can\\n      find the homoeopathic drug that will be appropriate, what usually follows\\n      is a marked improvement in the mental status. We may have to combine the\\n      remedy with other measures as we did in the following two cases In those\\n      two cases, we have organ pathology which could not be definitely\\n      associated with he attack. They are both manic depressives, manic type,\\n      with Graves disease.\\n      \\n M.S., fifty-three years of age, school\\n      teacher, white, female, had three attacks of manic-depressive psychosis.\\n      On July 18, 1933, a thyroidectomy was performed. Within twelve days she\\n      became manic. On admission here a diagnosis of manic depressive psychosis,\\n      manic type, was offered. She had mitral disease, hypertension, showed\\n      signs of hyperthyroidism, dehydration and exhaustion. In two months she\\n      was sent home recovered.\\n      \\n R.D., aged fifty-seven, female,\\n      meningitis at age of two. In 1930, attempted suicide but was unsuccessful\\n      Two years later a thyroidectomy, and eight months following she was\\n      destructive, agitated, had delusions of death and at one time during this\\n      period she attempted suicide by drinking iodine. Admitted here September\\n      23, 1931. Diagnosis of manic-depressive, manic type, offered. Her\\n      condition was desperate. She had a poor heart, rapid pulse, exophthalmus,\\n      eye signs, tremors, low diastolic, moist skin, increased metabolic rate,\\n      hypertrophied heart; in addition she suffered from acidosis and developed\\n      carbuncle. Improvement was slow for a time, and then rapid progress;\\n      finally discharged April 6, 1932, residence in hospital being five charged\\n      April 6, 1932, resistance in hospital being five and one-half months. In\\n      both cases we have iodine in homoeopathic doses together, of course, with\\n      cardiac supportive treatment, anti-acidotic treatment, clysis, glucose\\n      injections, hydrotherapy, etc. with good results . At least the two cases\\n      survived.\\n      \\n We cannot go into the many physical\\n      symptoms arising from tissue pathology other than in the central nervous\\n      system which are found in our psychotics. Suffice it to say that we\\n      attempt in many such cases to find a drug that fits.\\n      \\n In depressed states drugs most commonly\\n      used at Middletown are ignatia, arsenicum album, phosphoric acid, cactus\\n      gran and baptisia.\\n      \\n Ignatia is probably more often\\n      prescribed than any other prescriptions. Butler, Talcott, Boyal and others\\n      referred to arsenicum album as most often indicated, the features of this\\n      drug being pale face, pinched appearance, emaciation, pallor, ceaseless\\n      restlessness, marked agitated depression, mental anguish to point of\\n      frenzy, moaning and groaning, self- destruction. Ignatia fits the silent,\\n      brooding, seclusive, depressed cases. They are usually quiet, timid,\\n      fearful, irresolute, and suffer from insomnia and impotence with sex\\n      desires.\\n      \\n Phosphoric acid is given in those cases\\n      with anxiety, sadness, grief over a love affair, inclined to weep,\\n      physical exhaustion resulting from masturbation.\\n      \\n Baptisia is given in typhoidal-like\\n      states.\\n      \\n The following case illustrates the good\\n      effect of ignatia in depressions.\\n      \\n R.W., aged sixty-one, white, male;\\n      occupation that of practical nurse. A quiet, pleasant personality who\\n      suffered several depressions earlier in life which did not necessitate\\n      hospitalization. In the beginning in 1932 he suffered a severe depression\\n      which persisted for six months, made voluntary application here August 15,\\n      1932, and was accepted. Diagnosed depressed type of manic depressive. His\\n      mental symptoms called for ignatia. He stated that the drug helped him a\\n      great deal. It had relieved him of his nervous, jumpy feelings and of his\\n      insomnia. He went home recovered June 30, 1933. For a time he was in good\\n      shape. On December 14, 1934, he came back to the hospital with same\\n      complaints. The depression came on six weeks previously. He requested the\\n      same drug which he stated had helped him previously. This was done with an\\n      improvement of his symptoms. In this case we cant tell whether the\\n      security and relief be obtained from the institution was projected onto\\n      the drug or whether the drug resulted in his improvement. The drug could\\n      have well been a rationalization of the sense of relief he obtained from\\n      institutional protection.\\n      \\n The next case of depression is a rather\\n      interesting mixture of psychogenic and organic factors, this case being\\n      helped by calcarea carb. and iodine. M.P., white, female, aged fifty-one,\\n      married, one child, had attack of manic excitement in 1916 which lasted\\n      three months. Last year, in worrying over her husbands financial troubles,\\n      she became obsessed with the idea that she had concentrated a disease and\\n      was infecting others. Had many ideas of bodily changes. Feared her body\\n      was rotting away. She spoke of death. AT night was seized with nightmares\\n      during which impulses to kill he son who she feared was going to be\\n      kidnapped, overwhelmed he. Calcarea carb. was prescribed Physically, a\\n      goitre and signs of hyperthyroidism were found. In this case there was an\\n      unconscious rejection of her body, and on this account arose guilt\\n      feelings, in the form of self-accusatory ideas and considerable anxiety.\\n      Mixed in this picture was also a sense of reality and misinterpretation of\\n      environment which we attributed to the organic state produced by\\n      hyperthyroidism. This was combated with small doses of iodine. Patient in\\n      two weeks and rid herself of all her abnormal ideas and was normal in all\\n      respects. Within a month she was home.\\n      \\n In the psychoneurosis we have at our\\n      disposal a large number of remedies depending on the character of the\\n      obsessions and fears and where the somatic pathology is fixed. What we do\\n      here, as in other of our so-called functional cases, is to divorce or\\n      abstract from the totality of individual reaction those mental symptoms\\n      and other characteristics of the patient and dry to approximate it to a\\n      drug giving similar symptoms. It would appear that the tissue alteration\\n      and general defense reaction which characterizes the drug would be\\n      nullified because of the apparent nonexistence of tissue pathology. This\\n      fallacy can be explained only under the presumption that we postulate the\\n      existence of such pathology, in a form that can be only subjectively\\n      received but not objectively recognized. At present we have followed the\\n      policy of the mental aspect of the patient. If he has somatic complaints\\n      we try to correlate still further by finding a drug giving similar somatic\\n      symptoms.\\n      \\n For example, we given nux vomica for\\n      hypochondriasis, persons who are irritable, sensitive to external stimuli,\\n      noises odors, and lights, and if they complain of gastric symptoms, sour\\n      stomach, etc., the remedy becomes more fitting. It is also given for\\n      alcohols who have similar mental symptoms and who we know have sour\\n      stomach, etc. It is obvious that in the latter cases the drug should be\\n      and is more of value. The results we obtain in the psychoneurosis are\\n      purely due to the suggestion or psychological effect of the drug. It has\\n      an advantage over the placebo in that we possibly may hit a remedy whose\\n      total symptomatology may conform to the totality of the organismal\\n      reaction. An other point is that in the placebo prescription the patient\\n      frequently becomes aware of it, becomes disturbed over the trickery and\\n      loses confidence in the physician, whereas, in our prescription they\\n      actually taste the medicine.\\n      \\n Some of the drugs commonly prescribed\\n      are aconite in combating numerous phobias; anacardium in neurosis produced\\n      by excessive mental stain with symptoms of anxiety, despair, fear of\\n      future, forgetfulness , inability to concentrate, nervous indigestion.\\n      Calcarea carb. for those who are apprehensive; fear of death, of\\n      misfortune, of losing their mind., of contracting a disease;\\n      nightmares,the obsessive type. For neurasthenia- ignatia, phosphorous;\\n      Kali phos. and strychnine phos. are more often prescribed. For insomnia,\\n      some of the drugs we use are ignatia if sleep is due to sadness and worry;\\n      arsenicum if it is due to multiple neuritis; zinc met if, as Talcott said,\\n      \"When prolonged mental overwork and close confinement have produced a\\n      state of forgetfulness; mental weakness, inability to apply the mind,\\n      broken and unrefreshing sleep.\" Following is a average result:\\n      \\n\\n      \\n MANIC-DEPRESSIVE ADMISSIONS DURING YEAR\\n      BEGINNING JULY 1, 1931,\\n      \\n AND ENDING JUNE 30 30, 1932\\n      \\n Ist Admission Readmission Total.\\n      \\n Duration of\\n      \\n Hosp Number Per cent Number Percent\\n      Number Percent\\n      \\n Residence\\n      \\n Under 1 Year 25 60 22 55 47 57\\n      \\n Less than 1 mo 3 8 5 12 8 10\\n      \\n 1-2 mos 5 12 4 10 9 11\\n      \\n 2-3 mos 3 8 1 22 4 5\\n      \\n 3-4 mos 2 5 3 8 5 62\\n      \\n 4-5 mos 3 8 3 8 6 8\\n      \\n 5-6 mos 1 2 3 8 4 2\\n      \\n 6-8 mos 4 10 1 22 5 22\\n      \\n 8-12mos 4 10 2 5 6 72\\n      \\n 1-2 yrs 1 22 4 10 5 6\\n      \\n 2-3 yrs 6 14 4 10 10 12\\n      \\n Still here 7 16 9 23 16 19\\n      \\n DEaths 4 1 5 6.\\n      \\n\\n      \\n Heart.\\n      \\n trouble\\n      \\n H.B., Psychoneurosis, neurasthenic\\n      type.

WE\\n      have briefly described some of our most common prescriptions with their\\n      indications. A few clinical cases have been offered as illustrations. In\\n      the main we have dealt with generalities, chiefly because of the\\n      realization of the gigantic problem one would have to face in getting down\\n      to absolute values and correlations.\\n      \\n Our conclusions are as follows:.\\n      \\n (1) The homoeopathic method operates\\n      without injury to the organism. It is gentle, does not involve large does,\\n      and tends to cover the disease in its totality.\\n      \\n (2) homoeopathic prescribing is a\\n      valuable adjunct in treating of mental reactions.\\n      \\n (3) The presence of physical disease is\\n      diligently searched in order to get a complete picture of the morbid state\\n      to be constructed. Physical ailments and troubles arising in or associated\\n      with our psychotics are immediately combated by homoeopathic and other\\n      efficacious means with favorable results. This is turn improves mental\\n      status of the patient.\\n      \\n (4) Psychoneurotics usually respond\\n      well, due to the psychologic effect and perhaps, in isolated cases, as\\n      result of the actual correlation of drug to the individual and his\\n      reactions.\\n      \\n (5) Homoeopathy is beneficial in cases\\n      with acute or chronic excitatory processes if the brain, either organic or\\n      psychogenic, either as result of its \" innocuous\" effect in that\\n      it removes the spectre of indiscriminate and injudicious use of sedatives\\n      and hypnotics or in some cases there is a positive effect in combating the\\n      process by stimulating the defense mechanism of the body, the production\\n      of antigens,. In such cases the drug may be similar to the drug used by\\n      other therapeutic approaches except in the matter of dosage.\\n      \\n (6) There may be cases of the\\n      functional psychosis that may respond perhaps because it satisfied some\\n      physical ailment, such as hyperthyroidism which accompanies the mental\\n      state as an associated factor.\\n      \\n (7) Chronic deteriorating conditions,\\n      either psychogenic or organic, have revealed no results.\\n      \\n PSYCHONEUROSIS ADMISSIONS FROM JULY 1,\\n      1931, TO JUNE 30, 1932\\n      \\n Ist Admission Readmission Total\\n      \\n Duration of Disease\\n      \\n Number Percent Number Percent Number\\n      Percent\\n      \\n Under 1 yr 9 50 3 16 12 67\\n      \\n Less than 1 mo 1 5+ 1 5+\\n      \\n 1-2 mos 3 16 1 5+ 4 22+\\n      \\n 2-3 mos 2 102 1 5+ 3 16\\n      \\n 3-44 mos 1 5+ 1 5+\\n      \\n 4-55 mos 1 1 5+ 1 5+\\n      \\n 4-5 mos 2 102 2 102\\n      \\n 6-12 mos 1 5+ 1 52\\n      \\n 1-2 yrs 2 102 2 102\\n      \\n 2-3 yrs 1 5+ 1 52\\n      \\n Here 3 16 1 5+ 4 22+ .', u'Tresorie - The Homoeopathic Aspects of the Diabetic Case [Homoeopathic\\nAspects Of Diabetic Case]\\n Convention of the A.I.H., a New York\\n      City, June 206, 1935.\\n      \\n GARTH W. BOERICKE, M.D.\\n      \\n Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\\n      \\n IT HAS been said that every surgical\\n      case has a medical aspect. In a similar way, we might say that every\\n      diabetic case has a homoeopathic aspect.\\n      \\n The indications upon which we prescribe\\n      homoeopathic drugs in this disease do not very from those which we employ\\n      in all other cases. It is true that with some drugs, notably phosphorus.,\\n      arsenic, sulphur and uranium nitrate, we have a physiologic basis and a\\n      very pretty biologic theory upon which to justify their use. These will be\\n      referred to in their proper fact, that to get results in diabetes,\\n      homoeopathically, our criteria must be systematic, homoeopathic\\n      indications, always bearing in mind the fact that the drug used should be\\n      able to produce similar physiologic changes and, if possible, similar\\n      pathology.\\n      \\n Of late years, quite a bit has been\\n      written about numerous insulin substitutes which are drugs from various\\n      parts of the world having a common property of reducing blood sugar and\\n      rendering the doses of insulin less in amount. These have been very well\\n      covered by papers given on former occasions before this institute, notably\\n      by our chairman, Dr. McGavack, and by Dr. Bartlett. We shall simply review\\n      briefly their conclusions.\\n      \\n Bartlett is not enthusiastic regarding\\n      these substitutes for insulin and concludes that they are of limited value\\n      and give results in mild cases which could be well managed by diet alone.\\n      \\n Under this class he lists myrtillin, an\\n      extract of the common blueberry. Belonging to this class are syzigium and\\n      jambolanum.\\n      \\n Synthelin is a guanadine compound and\\n      probably owes its effect to its action on the liver. It is therefore, not\\n      well thought of by most clinicians. While it may reduce blood sugar, it\\n      has no effect on ketosis, it may reduce blood sugar, it has no effect on\\n      ketosis, weight, strength or energy and intolerance is common.\\n      \\n Mcgavack completes the lost of drugs\\n      which lower blood sugar physiologically when by mouth, adding ergotamine,\\n      morphine, codeine, and cocaine, also arsenic bromide.\\n      \\n The last-named drugs, with the\\n      exception of ergotamine, and produce their good effects through the\\n      homoeopathic law, as they do not cause a drop of blood sugar\\n      physiologically and indeed cause the opposite and would be, therefore,\\n      homoeopathic.\\n      \\n Ergotoxin and ergotamine produce a fall\\n      of blood sugar up to 85 per cent of the normal, which lasts about two\\n      hours. It has been used in clinical diabetes in doses of 130th of a grain.\\n      These purely experimental results have not been generally applied but are\\n      interesting.\\n      \\n McGavack also goes into quite a bit of\\n      detail as to why sulphur is indicated in diabetes on its physiologic\\n      action and lists a number of causes, among which is the fact that it is a\\n      constituent of he insulin molecule, that it is intimately concerned in\\n      tissue respiration, and therefore in the disposal of carbohydrates, and\\n      sulphur therefore in the disposal of carbohydrates, and sulphur compounds\\n      have been shown to exert a blood sugar lowering effect, independent of the\\n      mode of administration. Certainly, this is a striking biochemical\\n      confirmation of the clinical indications for this drug in diabetes.\\n      \\n The second point is the only one which\\n      may need some explanation and McGavack explains it clearly:.\\n      \\n \"To maintain functional capacity\\n      with inner tissues, particularly muscular tissue, it is essential that\\n      four fifths of the lactic acid formed from glycogen during exercise be\\n      reconverted into glycogen but the other one-fifth burst to carbon dioxide\\n      and water. A change is accomplished normally in the presence of insulin,\\n      and in turn the activity of insulin seems to depend upon the contained\\n      sulphur\".\\n      \\n In a similar manner, accumulation of\\n      acid substances which stimulate muscular contraction, joint symptoms, skin\\n      symptoms, familiar in diabetes, joint symptoms, skin symptoms, familiar in\\n      diabetes, may be explained physiologically from this explanation.\\n      \\n As long as we are talking about\\n      sulphur, we might as we complete the clinical indications which might call\\n      for this drug in a clinical case of diabetes.\\n      \\n The drug is not listed among important\\n      ones for diabetes by any of our leading authors. That is, perhaps, a\\n      full-blown picture of a diabetic case is a bit too active to call sulphur\\n      to mind hat may not correspond in some large modality as desire for the\\n      open air, vasomotor disturbances, etc. Nevertheless, there are certain\\n      sulphur characteristics which are certainly very suggestive. For instance,\\n      the old symptoms \"drinks a great deal but eats little\" is\\n      certainly the polydipsia of diabetes. The irritation and itching of the\\n      skin the either ravenous appetite or loss of appetite, and the urinary\\n      train of symptoms all come under the hands, stiffness of the joints, are\\n      also good sulphur symptoms. The cat-nap sleep, especially in the early\\n      morning, weakness, and mental irritability, depression are frequently\\n      found in this disease.\\n      \\n A person suffering from suboxidation\\n      cannot be expected to be relieved by cold or to desire cold air: hence\\n      these cases will not in that respect point toward sulphur, even though\\n      their other symptoms may be sulphur. I think this point has been\\n      overlooked in the use of this drug by our older authors, who arbitrarily\\n      ruled out a drug without its major modality, without seeking an\\n      explanation.\\n      \\n In my experience, I found the most\\n      useful drug in diabetes to be experience, I found the most useful drug in\\n      diabetes to be phosphorus. Again we have a biologic interpretation of why\\n      it is useful. There is a disturbance in the ability of the body to form\\n      carbohydrates from fatty acids, amino acids, and lactic acids, as is done\\n      by the normal individual . Coupled with this is a loss of the power to\\n      store excess carbohydrates as glycogen. Under normal conditions\\n      carbohydrate is being constantly carried to the liver from the bowel and\\n      fat from the subcutaneous deposits is carried to the liver and there\\n      broken down, carbohydrates being formed from it.\\n      \\n We know that fatty disturbances in the\\n      form of acidosis are a common and fared complication of this disease. It\\n      would seem that phosphorus is indicated in order to ingest this fat to\\n      normal metabolism.\\n      \\n Phosphorus, as has been said, markedly\\n      affects metabolism and all synthetic process are hindered and the\\n      catabolic are speeded up. It is, therefore, easy to understand the wasting\\n      to this disease which may be common in diabetes and also in other\\n      conditions such as tuberculosis.\\n      \\n From a clinical standpoint, a great\\n      indication for phosphorus in diabetes is where there is a respiratory\\n      complication,either a chronic bronchitis or cough. A concurrent nephritis\\n      also is a further indication inasmuch as phosphorus produces a very\\n      definite nephritis, and if albumin casts and blood cells are seen along\\n      with the diabetic this is a further indication.\\n      \\n Under this drug, there is weakness,\\n      particularly of the extremities, various paraesthesias due to the anemia,\\n      emaciation, many digestive symptoms, partially relieved by cold food and\\n      drink. Vomiting is seen, the liver apt to be tender, and there is an\\n      empty, gone sensation are well-marked the most important of which is the\\n      feeling of oppression or weight.\\n      \\n Phosphoric acid is some what allied to\\n      phosphorus but is generally considered clinically to apply to these cases\\n      where there has been a nervous shock, grief, etc. The condition is always\\n      aggravated by mental over work or worry, or even physical excesses. Royal\\n      says that the ranking symptom is apathy. There is large quantity of\\n      uranium typically of the diabetic type. This drug is usually given in\\n      large doses from the 15 drops of the tincture or one X.\\n      \\n A clinical remedy used by some of our\\n      best clinicians is acetic acid. It certainly has a great many symptoms of\\n      severe cases if diabetes, such as the marked wasting and debility, and\\n      weakness of all the muscles and limbs; the skin is pale, waxen, and\\n      emaciated. The main symptoms, however, revert to the stomach and burning\\n      is the main point.\\n      \\n Water brash, salivation, violent\\n      burning pain in the stomach. Often followed by vasomotor disturbances,\\n      such as cold sensation and cold sweat.\\n      \\n Iodine is a drug which is generally\\n      overlooked in this condition. It has many of the general symptoms which\\n      are characteristic of th diabetic, such as the excessive appetite, dry\\n      skin, nervousness, marked action on the glands, especially the pancreas.\\n      The know its relation to the thyroid, and it has been shown that the\\n      hormones from the pituitary action on the thyroid modify carbohydrate\\n      control as manufactured by the lover. Oftentimes mechanisms of this been\\n      shown that the hormones from the pituitary acting on the thyroid modify\\n      carbohydrate control as manufactured by the liver. Oftentimes mechanisms\\n      of this sort serve to explain rational the clinical success of our\\n      homoeopathic drugs when at first-hand they seem to have no special tissue\\n      correspondence. Constricture sensations are prominent under iodine,\\n      particularly around the heart. Although the skin is dry, the least\\n      excitement induces perspiration, especially on the palms. Cardiac symptoms\\n      aggravated in the warm room may go along with the iodine case.\\n      \\n It is interesting to note that when our\\n      proving squad at Hahnemann proved posterior pituitary in its 12X. symptoms\\n      complained of were quite analogous to an early case of diabetes, and when\\n      we consider that the endocrine factor i sugar metabolism is coming more\\n      into the fore, this finding is quite interesting.\\n      \\n The above named drugs are simply a\\n      brief list of those which should be at least considered in ad diabetic\\n      case. As a general rule, the more complications there are, the more they\\n      should be considered. For instance, if gangrene is a feature of the case,\\n      our drug secale come in, which has a very interesting effect upon\\n      carbohydrate metabolism as well as causing generalized constriction and a\\n      well-known type of gangrene for which it has been prescribed for many\\n      years.\\n      \\n We many in certain cases have clear\\n      indications for other of our polychrests which at first sight do not seem\\n      to be able to cause diabetes mellitus in the way that we can see that it\\n      is produced now. However, if we had clear indications for drugs such as a\\n      silica, argentum nitricum, or arsenic, we should not hesitate, as this\\n      drug many just turn the balance and alter a complicated metabolism which\\n      will result in marked clinical improvement.', u'Tresorie - A Resume of Appendicitis [Resume Of Appendicitis]\\n JOSEPH H.FOBES, M.D., F.A.C.S.\\n      \\n New York, N.Y.\\n      \\n THIS is a report of 421 cases operated\\n      on by a highly specialized technic. These were all personal operations by\\n      the author. They included all types of cases as they came. They included\\n      all agents. They were operated upon in four different hospitals in the\\n      metropolitan area. This shows that they were not selected cases. They were\\n      consecutive.\\n      \\n The pathologic diagnosis was verified\\n      in every cases and ranged all the way from simple catarrhal appendicitis\\n      to the acute gangrenous type.\\n      \\n There were four deaths in this series.\\n      \\n (1) Diagnosis of acute gangrenous\\n      appendicitis with rupture and general peritonitis, died on the operating\\n      rupture and general peritonitis, died on the operating table, evidently\\n      moribund and hardly a fair case by which to judge the value of the\\n      operation. Also a case that cannot be fairly attributed to the operation.\\n      \\n (2) Acute gangrenous ruptured appendix,\\n      with a concretion.\\n      \\n (3) Subacute appendicitis,died suddenly\\n      from an embolism nearly two months after the operation. Also a case that\\n      cannot be fairly attributed to the operation.\\n      \\n (4) This case was sick for a month\\n      before he was operated upon. having been treated for typhoid fever. He\\n      died eight days after the operation from a general peritonitis.\\n      \\n The complete mortality rate is about 1\\n      per cent. If the two cases which were hardly fair to include as a\\n      mortality were removed, the rate would be cut in half -5 per cent.\\n      \\n There are three reasons for this low\\n      death rate. The first is the fact most of the cases were private ones and\\n      had been carefully diagnosed early by the medical practitioner. Second,\\n      the technic of the operation, which will be described later. Third, the\\n      early use of hypodermic cascara and pituitary extract preventing dilated\\n      stomach, and the right lateral prone position levering localization of the\\n      infection in the right lower quadrant.\\n      \\n The operative technic, which is shown\\n      in the moving picture, is a modification of the McBurney. The original\\n      McBurney incision was made one-third of the distance from the distance of\\n      the anterior superior spine to the umbilicus. The skin is then cut and the\\n      muscles split in the direction of the fibers, the peritoneum being lifted\\n      and cut. The center of this incision usually found itself located at the\\n      junction of the ileum with the caecum a little to the ileal side, thus\\n      invading the general peritoneal cavity.\\n      \\n When you consider that nearly 90 per\\n      cent of this series of case showed that Wakeleys report was correct, ie.,\\n      that in about 90 of cases the appendix is located retrocaecal or\\n      retrocolic, the right rectus incision and even this original McBurney\\n      incision bring one to the median side of the proper operative field.\\n      \\n The modified incision is located a\\n      fingers breadth medial to the anterior superior spine. The average length\\n      is approximately one to one and one-half inches. The muscles are cut in\\n      the direction of the fibers and lifted by hemostats and not retractors.\\n      The peritoneum drops well down but is adherent at its outer side to the\\n      lateral wall. By raising the abdominal wall with a hemostat the outer fold\\n      of the peritoneum is brought into position. It is usually covered with\\n      abdominal fat and sometimes a little difficult to distinguish. The fat\\n      must be wiped off carefully with forceps to make sure one has the\\n      peritoneum. The avenue of approach at this spot lies external to and\\n      behind the caecum. Sometimes the appendix is so far to the outer side that\\n      the tip is quite easily visible, but as a rule the examining finger should\\n      be passed into the abdomen and the caecum and appendix located carefully,\\n      not breaking up any adhesions. The eye in the end of the finger becomes so\\n      educated that the pathology is quite apparent. Possessing the long type of\\n      index finger, one readily can palpate the right ovary and tube.\\n      \\n If the pathology is serious, common\\n      sense dictates lengthening the incision upwards or downwards, according to\\n      desire. The approach to pathology is much safer from the lateral aspect.\\n      The adherent appendix can much better be removed from behind and to the\\n      outer side of the caecum than towards the median line.\\n      \\n The appendix is removed in the ordinary\\n      clamp, ligature, carbolic method, the approved method of choice in a\\n      survey made of practically all of the hospitals in the United States\\n      several years ago, under the auspices of the Archives of Surgery.\\n      \\n From the point of anesthesia alone, the\\n      location of this incision is of interest. Our anesthetists tell us that or\\n      patients require lighter anesthesia with less resultant shock; our nurses\\n      tell us that there is less gas pain, a better morale, and a quicker\\n      recovery.\\n      \\n The average time of bed rest in these\\n      cases, in men, is about two days; in women,from three to seven days.\\n      \\n The incidence of hernia is practically\\n      nil except in the cases where there was, necessarily, drainage. The one\\n      month, six months, and a year, follow-up examinations show practically no\\n      untoward results.\\n      \\n The contra-indications for this type of\\n      operation are: (a) the existence of any other more serious abdominal\\n      pathology, where the appendix is simply an incidental part of the trouble;\\n      (2) the lack of careful diagnosis; (3) a lack of technical skill and\\n      anatomic awareness (the technic of this operation requires thoughtful\\n      execution step by step.', u'Tresorie - OBSERVATIONS ON SOME OF THE AXIOMS, APHORISMS, AND RULES OF\\nHOMOEOPATHY [Observations On Some Of Axioms Aphorisms & Rules Of\\nHomoeopathy]\\n\\n LIFE is the result of the incessant\\n      action of an invisible, immaterial, essential, and dynamic principle, of\\n      which the regularity and harmony of the functions constitute health, while\\n      their derangement and discord constitute disease.\".\\n      \\n This definition necessarily implies\\n      that if this functional harmony does not exist, in either its organic or\\n      spiritual relations, we must have discord. To me, the is law appears\\n      almost universal. In towns from 1000 to 100,000 or more inhabitants, and\\n      in such a city as Bogota, where I live, which has 140,000, I have\\n      investigated the state of health of many undoubtedly robust persons with\\n      the general result that they did not feel quite well; one had a headache,\\n      another indigestion, chills, remittent pains, etc.; apart, of course, from\\n      mental complaints of melancholy, forgetfulness, and hypochondria; all of\\n      which investigations prove my proposition.\\n      \\n A rule of teaches us to infer the\\n      unknown from the known;. analogy, given the condition of a people living\\n      in certain climates and hygienic surroundings, we may infer the conditions\\n      of other peoples in the same circumstances, or as we may infer that\\n      pathological causes are more prolific in the city than in the country with\\n      its purer air, water, and food. What conclusions can be drawn from these\\n      observations? Simply, that mankind, as a body, is physically and mentally\\n      diseased, although a good external appearance may indicate perfect health,\\n      just as happens with fruits of good color, the interior of which is\\n      unsound.\\n      \\n In man, the two forces of conservation\\n      and destruction, health, and disease, are in ceaseless warfare, the end of\\n      which is death. The pathological state, whether latent or active, moral or\\n      physical, is a natural one.\\n      \\n Can the provings of medicines be\\n      obtained on a healthy person, since we have demonstrated that disease is\\n      inherent in life itself, and that the very word life is relative to death,\\n      or merely a synonym for the constant transformation of matter?.\\n      \\n Most probably until now, medicines have\\n      had to be proved on diseased persons, and the pathogenesis have not been\\n      obtained from healthy ones, consequently the diseased state produced was\\n      not artificial but rather a union with an organic pathological state.\\n      \\n Moreover, account must be taken of the\\n      purity or impurity of water, and the chemical atmospheric gents that may\\n      have an influence in producing new, or modifying old symptoms, and we must\\n      especially consider the individual temperament, the climate, customs, etc.\\n      How, therefore, shall we distinguish natural from induced disease, and how\\n      shall we obtain an absolutely pure drug in every sense of the word?.\\n      \\n If two symptomatologies are recorded,\\n      one before, the other after taking the drug, the result will be\\n      particularized so as to destroy any general pathogenesis.\\n      \\n In the Organon of the immortal\\n      Hahnemann occurs this statement, \"Only by means of repeatedly\\n      verified observations on a great number of individuals of both sexes\\n      suitably selected, can we arrive at a knowledge of the ensemble of morbid\\n      conditions which a drug is able to produce; that is to say, successive\\n      provings must give nearly identical results.\" This rule is very\\n      important, because it necessitates accuracy as to the symptoms produced by\\n      a medicinal agent or a to the power of a drug to alter and modify health.\\n      \\n The microscope has shown us that earth,\\n      air, light, and was and even stones contain innumerable animalcule, which\\n      chemistry can reduce to the original elements of carbon, oxygen, hydrogen,\\n      and nitrogen. how shall we know for certain, when we administer a drug,\\n      that it is this drug which has produced the cure,. and not the chemical\\n      atoms which the drug contains? aLl that we are sure of is that the drug\\n      was not absolutely pure; hence we may conclude: That ideal health does not\\n      exist, and that provings do not constitute law; that drugs cannot to\\n      prepared pure, and that pathogenesis cannot be generalized.\\n      \\n The vehicles for preparing Homoeopathic\\n      drugs are alcohol, sugar of milk, starch, etc., because they are\\n      considered inert, but as we have shown that they contain, or themselves\\n      may be, medicinal substances, they cease to be inert and innocent to the\\n      economy, and for that reason they cannot serve as vehicles for\\n      pharmaceutical preparations.\\n      \\n According to the definition of physics\\n      inertia is a purely negative property, that is to say it does not exist.\\n      Inertia is, in a certain sense, activity, hence any combination, however\\n      weak, develops a new body with a greater or less amount of released\\n      electricity, as, for example, the formation of a neutral salt by the union\\n      of sulphuric acid and an alkali.

DUNN, M.D.,.\\n      \\n Secretary.', u'Tresorie - SURGICAL SHOCK [Surgical Shock]\\n\\n THANKS to anesthesia and antisepsis,\\n      pain and poison have been eliminated from operative surgery, and the most\\n      formidable complication now remaining for the surgeon to cope with, is\\n      shock. Its paramount importance, and the meagerness of the subject, make\\n      its further study eminently advisable. As here considered, the subject has\\n      nothing to do with \"railroad spine\" or \"litigation\\n      symptoms,\" but is no deal with the immediate constitutional phenomena\\n      produced by local traumatism, and will be used synonymously with collapse.\\n      It will not be understood by this that shock cannot be produced by psychic\\n      as well as traumatic influences. The interdependence of the mind and body\\n      is shown by the influence of impressions that fall upon the retina from\\n      without. Let a patient who is to be operated gaze upon an elaborate array\\n      of instruments, and in some cases the effect is most pronounced. Through\\n      the mind the knees quake with terror, the hair stands on end, the brain\\n      reels, the heart beats tumultuously, the respiratory apparatus stammers\\n      and gasps, the perspiration oozes from every pore, the urine is voided or\\n      suppressed-in fact any of these organs may be transiently disturbed or\\n      even paralyzed. These are familiar illustrations, but severe to show that\\n      psychical disturbances may act powerfully upon our physical being; and who\\n      can tell (and I ask it in all charity and kindness) how much this had to\\n      do with the death of Col. Sheperd?.\\n      \\n The above examples would seem to\\n      indicate that, turn and twist it how we will, we cannot escape from the\\n      fact that the mind is a power within our muscular being (Mueller), or that\\n      the psychical and physical are practically one, and that the normal status\\n      of our grosser structures is more or less dependent upon the mind as well\\n      as the heart or lungs. Although shock of this variety may be profound, it\\n      is not necessarily surgical, but the varieties which are the accompaniment\\n      of visible trauma, and especially if coincident or subsequent to surgical\\n      operation, are of special interest to us. Because the symptoms of shock\\n      are so familiar, they may wisely be omitted; but, on the other hand, its\\n      pathology is so obscure that it demands further study. The most advanced\\n      work on surgery takes up surgical shock, and dismisses the subject of its\\n      pathology with the statement that it consists of paralysis of the\\n      vaso-motor system. Other works, devoting several pages to the pathology,\\n      add nothing to the above except what is conjectural. We know that\\n      peripherally the capillary resistance is diminished; so, too, is the\\n      motive power of the cardiac centres. If the vaso-motor supply be cut off\\n      from one part of the body, the vessels therein dilate, but in a few days\\n      recover their tone, although future contraction and expansion are\\n      dependent upon local stimuli. The abdominal vessels may or may not be\\n      dilated. Further than this, everything at present lies beyond the range of\\n      human perception. We may say that in shock there is a disturbance of the\\n      molecular equilibrium, which can no longer liberate force, but this is of\\n      little satisfaction to the analytical mind. Autopsies teach us nothing of\\n      the pathology, no post-mortem traces ever having been discovered. The\\n      whispering of molecular vibrations, which constitute human agony, is lost\\n      in the roar of hurrying dissolution.\\n      \\n The clinical phenomena, however,\\n      corroborate the vaso-motor theory, and the consequent relaxed vascular\\n      system. It is borne out especially by the intense thirst and the\\n      incredible quantities of water that many of these patients drink during\\n      profound relapse.\\n      \\n CASE 1.-Removal of four and one-half\\n      inches of rectum for epithelioma. The operation was tedious but not very\\n      bloody, only two vessels being ligated. The operation was completed, and\\n      the patient, in the most profound collapse, was placed in bed. The pulse\\n      was but an occasional flicker, the respiration faint; features pinched and\\n      ghastly, pupils dilated. The ears and supra- sternal fossa were filled\\n      with cold sweat, and the body and limbs wet and cold. Hypodermic\\n      stimulation brought about little or no improvement, and as there was\\n      fortunately no vomiting, I decided to try simulating fluids by the\\n      stomach. Brandy and hot water was administered, at first a few drops at a\\n      time, but it was soon given freely, when it was perceived that deglutition\\n      was unimpaired. Suffice it to say that during that night he drank nearly\\n      five quarts of the liquid, though much of the time too weak to do more\\n      than turn his eyes appealingly toward the glass. He rallied the next day,\\n      the temperature not running above normal. In such cases the desideratum\\n      seems to be to give the relaxed vascular system something to contract\\n      upon.\\n      \\n The proneness of intestinal lesions to\\n      produce shock is worthy of attention and so is the deception in its\\n      manifestations, especially during the period preceding dissolution. It is\\n      characterized by cessation of pain and sometimes vomiting, both of which\\n      may have been persistent, and the patient becomes perfectly easy and\\n      rational and the temperature may be normal. This is augur of collapse,\\n      which is precipitated by operation.\\n      \\n CASE II.-I was called hurriedly to the\\n      suburbs, and went prepared to operate for suspected intestinal\\n      obstruction. Found the patient able to sit up, feeling perfectly\\n      comfortable and having a normal temperature. The history as well as\\n      condition upon examination corroborated the tentative diagnosis, and after\\n      giving the family a most guarded prognosis the patient was hastily\\n      prepared for operation. The abdomen was quickly opened and a quantity of\\n      dark brownish fluid came to view, and instantly the patient was collapsed.\\n      The pulse was lost and the respiration consisted of an occasional gurgling\\n      in the throat. Inversion and subcutaneous stimulation were quickly\\n      resorted to. A hasty examination of the abdomen revealed a twist in the\\n      small intestines lying in the left hypochondrium. Below this the gut was\\n      collapsed; above it, markedly distended and five or six feet of it black\\n      and gangrenous. Holding the intestines in with hot sponges, we placed her\\n      in a warm bed and surrounded her with artificial heat and continued the\\n      stimulation, the abdominal wall being sutured in the meantime. She rallied\\n      slowly, only to die seven hours later, and another death was registered,\\n      hastened by operation, and yet preventable by earlier interference. Here\\n      life is unstable, and the slightest molestation is sufficient to destroy\\n      the equilibrium, but humanity prompts us to attempt to aid while yet the\\n      fingers of our surgical instincts are palpating the lean possibilities\\n      that lie beneath the abdominal wall.\\n      \\n Before going further, I wish to wring\\n      the neck of a moss- grown delusion. There has been much teaching to the\\n      effect that surgical shock is in proportion to the extent of the injury\\n      received. This is not true; the extent of the injury is no standard by\\n      which to estimate the intensity of the shock. It has been said that\\n      \"shock is the measure of the ability of an individual to resist\\n      hurtful influences form without.\" In a general way this is good, but\\n      it is far more likely that it is a measure of the power of resistance\\n      possessed by certain organs or structures.\\n      \\n CASE III. will illustrate my meaning. A\\n      female about forty, with a hydatid cyst of the liver as large as a\\n      coconut. Being incapacitated for household duties, she desired an\\n      operation. The abdomen was opened freely, but the cyst was non-removable\\n      (en mass) because firmly adherent in all directions save toward the line\\n      of incision. The intestines were pushed aside and a passage to the tumor\\n      maintained by a firm packing of Iodoform gauze. In spite of the rather\\n      free handling of the abdominal contents (because of a desire to extirpate\\n      if possible), there was little or no shock following the operation. During\\n      the next few days her general condition improved, and when sufficient time\\n      had elapsed to allow the bowels to be walled off firmly the cyst was\\n      opened, and this simple procedure was followed by the most pronounced\\n      disturbance of all the vital functions. The pulse was a mere thread, and\\n      running one hundred and seventy-six to the minute, and vomiting was quite\\n      troublesome. It was evident that her life was greatly imperiled, and I was\\n      quite doubtful as to the issue. A point of hot black coffee in the rectum\\n      and hypodermic injections of twenty minims of Digitalis tincture brought\\n      the pulse down in two hours to one hundred and twenty to the minute. She\\n      was then complaining of the strong taste of the coffee, and was tided over\\n      the danger of the hour.\\n      \\n CASE IV. is even more suggestive. Mrs.\\n      G., aet. 51, suffering from a large ovarian cyst. The abdomen was opened\\n      and the tumor, weighing fifty-five pounds, removed. There was no\\n      post-operative shock, and the laughed and joked with the return of\\n      consciousness. A few days later an enema of warm water was given by a\\n      competent nurse, and was promptly followed by profound shock. It was a\\n      very good picture of Travers\\'s \"prostration with excitement.\"\\n      She tossed wildly, the respiration were quick and shallow, pulse lost in\\n      one wrist and flickering in the other, skin clammy and cold. She\\n      complained of nothing definite, but the face was expressive of\\n      indescribable anguish. Arsenicum 3x was administered, and, aided by sharp\\n      stimulation, she made a good recovery.\\n      \\n There was a suspicious flabbiness about\\n      this patient that I did not like, and on this account the operative work\\n      was conducted with all possible dispatch in order to avert shock. The\\n      significant fact, however, is that she could withstand a laparotomy but\\n      not a rectal injection.\\n      \\n The examples showing that the extent of\\n      the injury is not in proportion to the shock might easily be multiplied.\\n      Opening a digital abscess has produced death; a slight blow upon the\\n      testicle or epigastrium will result in alarming depression of all the\\n      vital forces. I have seen simple skin plantation for an ulcer of the leg\\n      followed by severe shock, from which the patient did not recover for\\n      forty-eight hours.\\n      \\n In one particular, shock has not been\\n      sufficiently dwelt upon, either by writers, teachers, or operators, and\\n      that is, that sudden cessation of life in an individual does not, of\\n      necessity, mean cessation of cellular life in the tissues. This is a\\n      legitimate conclusion, and is based upon investigations in physiological\\n      chemistry, corroborated by observations in natural history and by the\\n      experience of surgical clinicians. We may say that, grossly, the animal\\n      life is extinct, but histologically there is yet life and function in the\\n      tissues. This is shown by the fact that muscle removed from an animal\\n      killed suddenly will for some time give off carbon dioxide, absorb oxygen,\\n      and respond to electric stimuli. Even after rigor mortis has occurred,\\n      tremblings, elongations, and contractions have been observed. After cross\\n      section of a tadpole the tail will not only live for some time, but will\\n      actually grow if allowed to remain in the water (Vulpian). For more than\\n      twenty-four hours after removal from the animal the pancreas continues its\\n      fermentation, and the liver also produces sugar slowly after death.\\n      Surgeons know that ends of fingers severed and left upon the block have\\n      been sent for and made to live and grow upon their stumps, and that skin\\n      from recent corpses has been successfully grafted upon the living.\\n      \\n Now, if the cellular structures of the\\n      grosser muscles and glands thus continue their function, so must the\\n      histological elements of the heart muscle, or the respiratory apparatus or\\n      nervous system.\\n      \\n How often have we seen, upon the\\n      operating table, extinction of life which would be eternal were the\\n      surgeon to turn his back to the patient, and how often the operation\\n      resolves itself into a question, not of obtaining primary union, removing\\n      the tumor, or preventing a hernia, but of saving a human life.\\n      \\n The ghastly but tranquil features\\n      bedewed with tomby mist, the motionless thorax, the pulseless wrist-all\\n      these shape themselves into a picture with which almost every surgeon is\\n      familiar. In this case life is extinct, and from death to dust the pathway\\n      is straight, and all that lies between the patient and the grave is a\\n      death certificate.\\n      \\n The following I take from our hospital\\n      records:.\\n      \\n CASE V.-Patient 60 years of age and\\n      quite feeble. Heart, lungs and kidneys sound. Small, hard tumor in\\n      Douglas\\'s cul de sac, which cause much suffering. Prognosis very grave.\\n      Treatment: rapid abdominal section. The growth, an ovarian carcinoma,\\n      lifted, and a ligature passed through the broad ligament, when it was\\n      announced that both respiration and circulation had stopped. The heart was\\n      still, and not the faintest sign of respiratory effort could be detected.\\n      The patient was inverted and artificial respiration resorted to, and was\\n      accompanied by hypodermic stimulation. For some time all effort seemed in\\n      vain, but slowly and faintly the pulse reappeared, and in about ten\\n      minutes she began to breathe and life was resumed. Actual time of\\n      operation a little over fifteen minutes.\\n      \\n There is no more tragic scene in human\\n      life than sudden collapse on the operating table. To know that one\\'s hand\\n      has shortened the life of a patient, even though doomed by some\\n      preexisting disease, is a horribly unwelcome sensation, but to know that\\n      resuscitation is possible, even when life seems extinct, robs operative\\n      surgery of much of its horror.\\n      \\n While we regret exceedingly that with\\n      our present knowledge we are unable to give the rationale of the phenomena\\n      of surgical shock, the great and absorbing question should be its\\n      prophylaxis, and I believe there is no other means by which so much can be\\n      accomplished in this direction as by rapid operating. Remember, that upon\\n      the operating table it is often impossible to differentiate traumatic\\n      shock from the toxic effects of our anaesthetics; that this period is\\n      usually characterized by subnormal temperature; that beyond a certain\\n      point every inhalation of the anaesthetic increases the depression; that,\\n      at best, operative insensibility means the establishment of a tendency\\n      toward death, and that the culmination of this tendency may occur during\\n      one single minute which is unnecessarily added to the time of operation.\\n      This thought should underlie all our surgical procedures, but I am afraid\\n      we may justly be charged with more or less disregard of this principle.\\n      There is not enough attention devoted to the pre-operative arrangements,\\n      and consequently too much dilly-dallying during the operation. How often\\n      have I seen an hour and more consumed in a simple trachelorrhaphy which\\n      could easily be accomplished in twenty minutes, or even twelve of fifteen\\n      minutes, with competent assistants. This must not be regarded as a\\n      reproach to beginners, but to those who have been operating long enough to\\n      possess much better technique. I would not be understood as desiring to\\n      sacrifice methods (good methods) for rapidity, but that I plead for better\\n      methods in order that the operative period may be reduced and with it the\\n      tendency to shock.\\n      \\n The preparation of the patient for a\\n      state of invalidism, too, is all important, and this having been done it\\n      should be a part of our professional ritual to operate in the morning\\n      whenever possible. I am well aware that there are lesions that can neither\\n      wait for preparatory treatment nor the morning hours, but the fact that\\n      this is just the class most prone to shock but shows the importance of the\\n      above observations-when they can be carried out.\\n      \\n Tranquilizing the patient\\'s mind, the\\n      administration of medicine before operation and the maintenance of proper\\n      temperature during the operation are too familiar to bear comment.\\n      \\n Nineteen years ago it was taught that\\n      inflammation and suppuration were reduced to the minimum, and that they\\n      were the inevitable accompaniments of operative surgery. Let us hope that\\n      our present ideas may be as abruptly changed, and that shock may yet been\\n      spelled from the list of surgical complications. At present, however, it\\n      must be admitted that shock cannot be positively averted and that the best\\n      the surgeon can do is to equip himself for the comprehensive grasp of\\n      critical emergencies.\\n      \\n Collapse on the table has been\\n      sufficiently dwelt upon already. I might add that in two cases I fancied I\\n      obtained relief by Maas method of rapid and rhythmic compression of\\n      cardiac region, but I cannot speak with any degree of positiveness of this\\n      method. In one case I obtained an abrupt renewal of respiration by anal\\n      dilatation. It has failed me in many others. In post-operative shock we\\n      can find a place for our Homoeopathic remedies, and while I never omit the\\n      general measures deemed necessary or at least essential, I have acquired\\n      an immense amount of faith in Camphora (low, of course). I would give more\\n      for this drug than for all the rest of our Materia Medica. Arsenic is\\n      good, and so is Veratrum alb., but often the vitality is so low that the\\n      stomach is inactive and we can obtain no results by this route.\\n      \\n In such cases a favorite resort with me\\n      is enemata of warm and strong black coffee; from a half pint to a quart,\\n      and repeated as fast as it is absorbed or till reaction is secured. Dr.\\n      Van Lennep has obtained good results from enemata of whiskey and\\n      Valerianate of ammonia-a teaspoonful of each.\\n      \\n After all, our main reliance is upon\\n      cardiac and respiratory stimulants, artificial respiration and artificial\\n      heat. Copious intra-venous or intra-cellular saline injections will always\\n      to remembered, especially if there has been much Haemorrhage.\\n      \\n The most manifest indications point,\\n      with imperative necessity, to tiding the patient over the perilous but\\n      brief period and our success in obviating the tendency to death will be in\\n      proportion to our ability to distinguish the direction from which death is\\n      threatening.\\n      \\n DISCUSSION.\\n      \\n I. T. TALBOT, M.D.: The subject of\\n      shock is one of great interest to every surgeon. First, because it may\\n      render a simple operation fatal, or in grave operations, suddenly turn the\\n      surgeon\\'s victory into defeat; and second, because he can never know\\n      beforehand the liability of the patient to shock, or the extent to which\\n      it may attain.\\n      \\n This paper of Dr. Macdonald\\'s suggests\\n      certain points of great importance to the surgeon, and among these the\\n      surgical character of the affection. We all appreciate the great\\n      difference in which different persons are affected by syncope or fainting.\\n      Some may understand the must violent injuries and yet retain their\\n      consciousness, while others faint on slight exhibitions of pain, or the\\n      sight of blood, or even the thought of injuries; and the effect upon the\\n      circulation, even to the almost complete cessation of the pulse; the\\n      pallor; the cold, clammy sweat; and the entire unconsciousness, are\\n      familiar to us all. The symptoms, except in degree, are quite similar to\\n      those of shock, and it is difficult to determine beforehand the patient\\n      most liable to be affected by it. As a rule we except it more in those of\\n      a highly nervous, active, or sanguine temperament, while those of a\\n      plethoric or sluggish condition are more exempt. Yet even this does not\\n      always hold true. .\\n      \\n Under my care a strong, highly\\n      plethoric man, who felt most fully able to go through the operation\\n      without ether, finally thought it best to take it for opening a palmar\\n      abscess, took the ether very favorably with little or no struggling, and\\n      after the operation had been performed, and he had partially rallied from\\n      the ether, suddenly went into collapse from which it was quite difficult\\n      to resuscitate him.\\n      \\n On the other hand, we have all met most\\n      nervous and excitable men and women who have gone through the severest and\\n      most long continued operation without any symptoms of shock or collapse.\\n      That the mind may affect the patient unfavorably I believe to be quite\\n      certain, and in looking over my notes I find several cases in which the\\n      patient had previously exhibited great dread of an operation feeling quite\\n      certain that she would not recover, in which although in no case fatal\\n      collapse occurred, yet it required during the operation and afterwards,\\n      careful watchfulness the first apparent symptoms.\\n      \\n In cases, then, of persons subject to\\n      easy syncope, I think it of great importance form the first to see that as\\n      far as possible their systems are in good condition physically, that they\\n      should have previously quiet rest, good food, and cheerful surroundings;\\n      that however much their friends, or the family may be informed of the\\n      possible dangers, the patient should only look to the most hopeful and\\n      encouraging prospects.\\n      \\n I fully approve of the use of Camphor\\n      as a stimulant, as suggested by Dr. McDonald, yet the most rapid and\\n      successful measure I have ever adopted has been the hypodermic injection\\n      of the finest quality of brandy. The motion of the patient, friction, and\\n      encouraging words on the first appearance of consciousness, will do much\\n      to speedily restore the patient.\\n      \\n L. H. WILLARD, M.D.: We have all\\n      listened to Dr. Macdonald\\'s paper on \"Surgical Shock\" with\\n      interest and attention both because the subject is of great importance and\\n      because of its able presentation. The subject is of especial interest as\\n      the opinions of surgeons differ widely not only as to treatment but as to\\n      the proper time to operate after an accident involving serious shock. I\\n      wish to discuss briefly this latter phase of the subject. Before doing so,\\n      however, let me present in a few words our method of treating shock at the\\n      Pittsburgh Homoeopathic Hospital, a method which is not new in any\\n      essential particular, but which has rendered excellent results.\\n      \\n Our hospital, being in the vicinity of\\n      many mills and manufactories, and having a railroad patronage, we are\\n      familiar with all varieties of shock from the slightest nervous depression\\n      or exaltation to the most profound collapse. A case of serious injury\\n      being received is at once taken to the operating-room, if the injury\\n      requires operative treatment, and the surgeons of the staff being sent\\n      for. vigorous restorative measures are begun and kept continuously.\\n      \\n These consist of, briefly:.\\n      \\n 1. Control of haemorrhage, by\\n      tourniquet or ligature.\\n      \\n 2. Heat-hot water bags, etc.\\n      \\n 3. Stimulation-by means of brandy,\\n      Digitalis, or the alkaloid hypodermic injection, Sparteine, Strychnine,\\n      Atropine. But especially have we found efficacious a mixture of brandy,\\n      ether and spirits of Camphor, equal parts, which administered by\\n      hypodermic injection, seems to have a salutary effect on the circulation\\n      in the state of collapse incidental to profound shock.\\n      \\n If there has been loss of blood we use\\n      hot water by mouth or rectum, and other ordinary means, such as bandaging\\n      the limbs, depressing the head and shoulders, etc.-Rectal injections of\\n      warm water seem to have been especially beneficial in many cases even\\n      where there was no appreciable loss of blood, having apparently a\\n      stimulating effect on the circulation and promoting the freer action of\\n      the kidneys which are especially prone to be affected.\\n      \\n The addition of a little salt\\n      facilitates absorption by raising the specific gravity more nearly to that\\n      of the blood. Our custom is to inject 4-8 ounces every 1-3 hours depending\\n      upon the necessities of the case. If the sphincters are lax a smaller\\n      quantity is used. Many cases of serious and seemingly fatal shock have\\n      been saved, I believe, by this means more than by any other. As instances\\n      in point I might cite two or three recent cases of crushed limbs requiring\\n      double amputation, one case of leg and thigh amputation having been\\n      brought ten miles to the hospital on the guard of an engine after a delay\\n      of two or three hours from the time of the accident. In this instance\\n      amputation was performed at once and restorative measures were kept up for\\n      many hours after. The state of a patient\\'s vitality is indicated, of\\n      course, by the condition of the pulse and respiration, and by the\\n      temperature. Operative measures, if not of immediate necessity, are\\n      delayed only long enough for the pulse, respiration and temperature to\\n      indicate a beginning reaction-not until full reaction has taken place. And\\n      it is in this particular but I wish to hazard an opinion at variance with\\n      generally accepted belief.\\n      \\n When I have a patient suffering from\\n      shock caused by an accident, the first thing necessary, it seems to me, is\\n      to relieve the depression, sustain his strength, and perform any operation\\n      that may be necessary as soon as possible and as quickly as can be done.\\n      This we know is the generally accepted belief of a great many surgeons,\\n      who give as reasons for such procedure that an operation, when the\\n      vitality is so low, would surely be fatal. No one who has waited patiently\\n      for his patient to recover fully from shock can help but feel that this\\n      waiting should be avoided. It is certain that the older surgeons, in times\\n      before anaesthesia was known, were right in laying down these rules in\\n      regard to shock, for in those times and under such conditions it would\\n      have been fatal to operate when the vitality of their patients was so low,\\n      thus intensifying the shock. But now, when we have anaesthetics to deaden\\n      the pain and even to improve the heart action (as it seems to do at\\n      times), and Camphor and other remedies to assist in stimulating the\\n      circulation, I cannot think it necessary to wait until full reaction has\\n      taken place before operating.\\n      \\n By so doing we nearly always produce a\\n      second shock, which may throw the patient into a condition beyond any help\\n      we may be able to render. In a given accident-a patient with crushed arms\\n      or legs, for example-tourniquets are applied to the part to prevent\\n      haemorrhage; and they not only control the haemorrhage, but they also cut\\n      off the entire circulation of the part. The nerves are pressed upon, and,\\n      in fact, the limb below the tourniquet is for the time being practically\\n      dead, and remains so until after the operation. Now it seems to me that\\n      the mere fact of an amputation when the patient is in a condition of\\n      shock, can do little harm to a part virtually dead. Mangled tissues are\\n      generally cut off and splintered bones removed. It is but little more to\\n      take away the entire crushed mass, sawing off the bone, and completing the\\n      necessary dressings, thus ending at once the pain and irritation caused by\\n      a mangled limb.\\n      \\n We are now speaking of crushed limbs\\n      and of operations done in the quickest possible manner, cure being taken,\\n      of course, to insure complete antisepsis, and the pulse and respiration\\n      being sustained by all necessary means. There are at times cases requiring\\n      long and tedious operative interference where it would be advisable to\\n      wait until the patient\\'s condition shall better enable him to withstand\\n      such a trial of his vitality.\\n      \\n Many cases, such as abdominal injuries,\\n      with protrusion or laceration of any of the viscera, require immediate\\n      surgical attention. Such cases do not seem to be markedly affected either\\n      by the use of an aesthetic or by the operation itself, so that even in\\n      cases not requiting immediate attention it is my custom to operate at once\\n      if the pulse shows any sign of returning vitality, rather than submit the\\n      patient to the risk of a second shock.\\n      \\n And in this line let me say that I\\n      believe the anaesthetic, especially chloroform, to have rather a\\n      stimulating than a depressing effect on the circulation in such instances.\\n      \\n THE CHAIRMAN: The subject is now open\\n      for general discussion. .\\n      \\n DR. BOOTHBY: Mr. President, it seems to\\n      me that it has not been made clear to us just what is considered surgical\\n      shock. We must distinguish between surgical shock and the shock from an\\n      injury, as has been spoken about in the last one of these discussions. In\\n      regard to surgical shocks proper, we have to distinguish between a true\\n      shock and the case that Dr. Talbot referred to. My opinion is that a\\n      surgical shock is a very rare occurrence. In the first place, I believe\\n      that a great cause of surgical shock is having the room too full, or the\\n      patient entirely denuded over a large portion of the body, and that the\\n      chill that comes from that is the cause of a great deal of the shock. I\\n      speak from my own experience and form the experience of my brothers,\\n      Packard and Emerson. We have almost never had a case of true surgical\\n      shock. We have done our operating in a very warm room, with a temperature\\n      as high as 85 degree. I have almost had it 90 degree, and while it is\\n      uncomfortable to the operator, and very uncomfortable to those looking on,\\n      it is decidedly beneficial for the patient. In the case of No. 1 in the\\n      original paper, while it is distinctly said that there was comparatively\\n      little haemorrhage, I believe that the collapse was due to the\\n      haemorrhage. I don\\'t see how an operation can be made without considerable\\n      haemorrhage if the patient is susceptible to fainting. In Cases 2 and 3 I\\n      have no doubt the septic condition of the system, and the changes the\\n      operator made in the anaesthetic, caused the trouble. I want to say one\\n      word in regard to the suggestion in the paper that the operation should be\\n      made as rapidly as possible. Perhaps I wouldn\\'t agree with Dr. Packard,\\n      for he operates very rapidly. I do not and cannot. I take a great deal of\\n      time for my operations. I believe if you are careful with your\\n      anaesthetics, and don\\'t give too much, and keep your patient just over the\\n      line and no further, you will have no trouble to keep him under the\\n      influence of ether. In regard to the administration of coffee, I hope you\\n      won\\'t use it. I have no argument in its favor, and I wouldn\\'t use it.\\n      \\n W.F. KNOLL., M.D.: This subject of\\n      shock after operation or injury is a very importance one to any surgeon\\n      who has done work a great while in public hospitals or railways. When such\\n      a complication arises in the course of an operation, it always goes far in\\n      the mind of our surgeons, and they have tried to find out its causes and\\n      what shock is. And after careful investigation of the subject, and from\\n      pathological observation, I have concluded that a shock is a sudden\\n      suspension of nerve forces. Now, shock is produce in one patient very\\n      easily and in another not so easily. I have seen it caused from dilatation\\n      of the return. I have seen shock from pulling a tooth. I have seen shock\\n      from a man simply washing out his ear. I have seen a patient upon whom I\\n      have amputated three limbs of the body, not affected a particle by shock.\\n      I have seen a patient at the age of 90 upon whom I have made an operation\\n      where there was scarcely any variation in the pulse. You never can say\\n      when a patient is going to have shock; it depends altogether upon the\\n      nervous organization of the patient, and taking that as a basis, what is\\n      the term \"shock?\" Take your patient as you find him. What do you\\n      see? You find a slow or a rapid pulse. You see that respiration is\\n      superficial. You have general relaxation and sometimes a discharge of\\n      urine. There is complete relaxation, the nervous system has been so\\n      profoundly affected that you have momentary paralysis. What do want to get\\n      at is to preserve the temperature of the body. Heat is no important thing;\\n      it is one of the main things. And in the second place, you want give a\\n      medicine which in a certain measure will restore the operation of the\\n      brain and the nerve centres, and the best thing is Strychnine. We have\\n      received from the hospitals some profound results from hypodermic\\n      injections of 1/120 grain of Strychnine. I believe in something that will\\n      have a stimulating effect also upon the circulation and upon the brain,\\n      and for that I believe Camphor is the best remedy. I believe it is a very\\n      good thing to place the head below the rest of the body. I believe\\n      hypodermic injection of some stimulant, especially brandy, and the\\n      flushing of the bowels with warm water with whiskey in it, is a very good\\n      thing. If you can find out the peculiarities of the patient, you can very\\n      often prevent shock. If you have a patient that is of a very highly\\n      nervous organization, by preparing the mind you can stop a great many\\n      complications that may follow operation. Now, the treatment that we have\\n      used with so much success can be summed up in this way: First, prepare\\n      your patients for the operation mentally and every other way; assure them\\n      they are going through their operation nicely; don\\'t have a great struggle\\n      with them under anaesthetics. In the second place, if shock takes place,\\n      keep up the temperature of the body at once. In the third place, use some\\n      hypodermic injection like Strychnine; in the next place, give something\\n      that will stimulate the heart\\'s action.\\n      \\n S.B. PARSONS, M.D.: Perhaps I am\\n      laboring under a wrong impression but it strikes me that Dr. Macdonald\\'s\\n      paper referred to shocks from accidents, more particularly than shocks\\n      from operative measures; therefore shocks from operative measures are not\\n      to be discussed at this time. There is one point that has absolutely been\\n      overlooked in the paper and discussion-one that has not been touched upon,\\n      yet one that has a more direct effect upon the patient than all the other\\n      matters that have been spoken of, and that is reflex action. We all know\\n      that sudden excitement of the sensory nerves will disturb the heart\\'s\\n      action and may arrest its movement. If the patient is undergoing the\\n      operation and has only been partially anaesthetized when the operation\\n      began, or when he is partially under it and it has been continued for some\\n      little time, then the sensory nervous will reflex painfully and affect the\\n      heart\\'s action, and its inhibitory movement. That is why we see sudden\\n      collapse during operation. There energy is so far below par that they are\\n      not able to stand both the shock and the anaesthetic without great\\n      stimulation. The heart is the thing to be looked after, not the warmth of\\n      the body; it is the heart. You have your collapse coming on suddenly; it\\n      is the action of the reflex movement upon the heart. That is all I have to\\n      say.\\n      \\n THE CHAIRMAN: If there is none other\\n      Dr. Macdonald will have an opportunity of saying anything he may desire in\\n      closing in the discussion.\\n      \\n DR. MACDONALD. Mr. Chairman, Members of\\n      the Congress: I will keep you just a moment. Something was said about\\n      Camphor. I don\\'t want to be misunderstood as to the use of Camphor or any\\n      other internal remedy, or as excluding stimulation. I believe hypodermic\\n      stimulation of importance. Something has been said with reference to\\n      chloroform as a heart stimulant in cases of shock. My experience has been\\n      very different; where I have used chloroform and the heart has become\\n      dangerously depressed I immediately use ether as a heart stimulant. I\\n      think that ether is a better heart stimulant than chloroform. I say I had\\n      some cases that collapsed. I want to say that all these cases were\\n      anaesthetized. You have been warned against the use of coffee. I admit in\\n      Boston there is a well-known way of using coffee, which is much better\\n      than putting it into the rectum. My experience is, as far as aesthetic\\n      matters go, it is better not to give it in that way. This is a matter of\\n      human life, and I don\\'t think of small matters like that. I am looking\\n      after the patient and human life. One of the cases I reported was aid to\\n      have been influenced by septicemia. It was charged by Dr. Boothby with\\n      having caused the collapse; that it was probably due to septicemia, and\\n      that it was a dangerous operation. Let me say that it was a case of either\\n      performing the operation or losing the patient. So I felt that the\\n      operation was justifiable. But I don\\'t want to be knocked down by the\\n      chairman, because he has an old grudge against me, and I will stop now.\\n      \\n DR. BIGGAR: What objection is there to\\n      preparing the patient and anticipating the shock by giving a small\\n      quantity of whiskey or a hypodermic injection in proper quantities in the\\n      proper time?.\\n      \\n DR. MACDONALD: I don\\'t know of any\\n      objection to it. In my paper I spoke of the use of medication before\\n      operation. It seemed to me so common and so ordinary that it didn\\'t\\n      require any comment at all. I use coffee, strychnine and brandy; in many\\n      cases I deem it advisable to use stimulants of alcoholic nature. .\\n      \\n DR.NIELSON, of Michigan: What shall we\\n      do with that large and growing class of people who object to alcoholic\\n      stimulants in any shape or form.\\n      \\n DR. MACDONALD: From my acquaintance\\n      with the member of the Congress I think we should have to go outside of it\\n      to find them.', u'Tresorie - OPHTHALMIC THERAPEUTICS [Ophthalmic Therapeutics]\\n\\n IT is quite unnecessary, as it would be\\n      inappropriate, for me to present to this audience, composed as it is of\\n      representative Homoeopathic physicians gathered from all parts of the\\n      civilized world, any arguments to prove the superiority of Homoeopathic\\n      therapeutics over all other methods of healing. On the other hand, in this\\n      Columbian year, when all religious, educational, and scientific bodies are\\n      holding congresses, it is fitting that we should show to the world what\\n      Homoeopathy has accomplished, and what it has to offer in contrast to\\n      Old-School teaching and practice.\\n      \\n It has devolved upon me to prepare to\\n      review of Homoeopathic therapeutics in our special department, that of\\n      ophthalmology. So much has been written lately upon this topic, that it is\\n      with diffidence I venture to discuss a subject so ably treated by other,\\n      and I crave your indulgence if much that I have to say seems trite.\\n      \\n This is an age of exact scientific\\n      investigation. Men demand facts, and not theories; and I propose to give\\n      you the facts of ophthalmic therapeutics, Homoeopathically considered, as\\n      compared with the treatment of the Old School.\\n      \\n It will not be inappropriate on this\\n      occasion for us to inquire what Homoeopathy has accomplished in this\\n      special department, and whether it offers any advantages over other\\n      methods. If Homoeopathy is, as the illustrious Dunham expressed it, the\\n      \"Science of Therapeutics,\" then the Homoeopathic specialist\\n      should be more scientific in the choice and application of curative agents\\n      than one who relies simply upon traditional, or physiological and\\n      empirical uses of drugs; and he should be correspondingly more successful.\\n      Does experience demonstrate this to be true? Our first duty is to our\\n      patients; our first motive is to cure them as speedily and as surely as\\n      possible. We should \"prove all things, and hold fast that which is\\n      good.\" We want the best. Is Homoeopathy the best? If not, let us\\n      known it. And if it, then let us demonstrate it so conclusively as to\\n      compel universal acknowledgment. It would be interesting and instructive\\n      to compare the results of the treatment of an equal number of cases of a\\n      given disease under the two systems, were reliable statistics available.\\n      We can contrast the ordinary treatment of eye-disease, as recommended in\\n      recent Old-School treatises, with the Homoeopathic treatment outlined in\\n      the latest and best work on the subject-dr. Norton\\'s Ophthalmic Diseases\\n      and Therapeutics.\\n      \\n That we may intelligently discuss the\\n      question, let us first clearly understand what we mean by Homoeopathic\\n      therapeutics as applied to ophthalmic affection. If we mean only the\\n      application of those drugs for the cure of morbid conditions which have\\n      actually caused similar functional disturbances and pathological lesions,\\n      them our resources are very much restricted; although in this limited\\n      interpretation of the subject, we have a number of valuable remedies.\\n      There are several reasons why our armamentarium is so much curtailed in\\n      this particular. In the first place, the records of poisoning furnish us\\n      with but few specific effects upon the eye, and our provings leave not, in\\n      many cases, been pushed to the extent of producing actual tissue changes.\\n      But the most important reason is the lack of skilled and accurate\\n      observation, which is apparent in the pathogenesis of drugs. Most recorded\\n      eye-symptoms are subjective, and frequently unreliable, because not\\n      rightly interpreted. Had every prover been subjected to a careful\\n      examination by a competent and experienced oculist, before and after a\\n      proving, and the condition of refraction, ophthalmoscopic appearance of\\n      fundus, etc, been accurately recorded, the provings would have been\\n      infinitely more valuable to the specialist. The proving of Duboisin by Dr.\\n      Deady, published in the Trans. of Am. Hom. O. and O. Society, 1880, is a\\n      model worthy of imitation, although we cannot help wishing that the eyes\\n      of the provers had been previously examined, and conditions noted.\\n      Eye-diseases are rarely purely local, especially those serious affections\\n      which endanger vision; but are usually the result of some systemic\\n      disorder, and require constitutional treatment. Similarly drugs do not\\n      affect the eye alone, but produce, in connection with eye- symptoms,\\n      indications of disturbance of remote organs and general constitutional\\n      effects. If, then, certain morbid conditions of the eye disappear under\\n      the exhibition of a remedy prescribed in strict conformity with the law of\\n      \"Similia,\" for general constitutional symptoms or for affections\\n      of other organs, is it not fair and logical to accept these eye-symptoms\\n      as reliable indications for that remedy in another similar case, even if\\n      the constitutional symptoms of the first case are lacking? is it not also\\n      probable that such a remedy, if fully proved in suitable doses, would\\n      cause the symptoms which it cures; and is not a verified symptomatology,\\n      acquired in the way suggested, a logical basis of Homoeopathic\\n      therapeutics?\\n      \\n With this understanding of our topic,\\n      and I think it is a reasonable one, we have an extensive armamentarium of\\n      specific- remedies. Allen and Norton\\'s Ophthalmic Therapeutics was\\n      compiled in this way from verified and trustworthy symptoms, and we owe an\\n      immense debt of gratitude to the authors and to the other faithful and\\n      skilful surgeons of the New York Ophthalmic Hospital, to whose labors we\\n      are largely indebted for the development of the resources of our school in\\n      this special department. In the possession of these specific remedies the\\n      Homoeopathic oculist has a great advantage over one of the Old School; but\\n      a thorough knowledge of drug effects upon the whale system, is a requisite\\n      for successful prescribing, as well as a familiarity with general\\n      diseases. We cannot successfully prescribe for eye-symptoms alone, nor can\\n      we ignore the relationship between ocular affections and diseases of other\\n      organs or the frequent dependence of eye-diseases upon constitutional\\n      dyscrasiae. For this reason an extended experience in general practice is\\n      very desirable before undertaking special work. The Homoeopathic oculist,\\n      with these added means of cure at his command,-I say \"added,\"\\n      for of course all resources of the healing art, from whatever source, are\\n      his to choose or to refuse,-can achieve results impossible without them.\\n      When all mechanical, local, and surgical measures are powerless, the\\n      suitable Homoeopathic remedy will often preserve or restore sight and cure\\n      disease, when Old-School medicine is confessedly of no avail. Many an\\n      operation can be obviated, and many an unfortunate sequence of operation\\n      can be obviated, and many an unfortunate sequence of operation be averted.\\n      Pain, in the large majority of cases, can be controlled without the use of\\n      narcotics, with their attendant unpleasant and sometimes dangerous\\n      effects, and the course of many diseases be materially shortened.\\n      \\n I promised to give you facts rather\\n      than theories, and in order to prove the truth of my assertions, let us\\n      critically examine and compare the therapeutic measures of the two schools\\n      in various affections. First, What does Old-School medicine offer for the\\n      relief and cure of eye diseases?.\\n      \\n In order to answer this question\\n      intelligently, I have carefully read and reviewed a recent text-book by a\\n      recognized authority-Noyes\\'s Diseases of the Eye-and noted every remedy\\n      recommended, with the indication for its employment. I have, of course,\\n      not noted local or surgical treatment, or the correction of refractive or\\n      muscular errors. The purely therapeutic resources, as therein outlined,\\n      comprise forty-three remedies, almost all of which are prescribed upon the\\n      most general principles, and where specific indications are given, they\\n      are most meagre in contrast with our methods of careful individualization.\\n      To particularize: \"appropriate\" general or constitutional\\n      treatment, such as alternatives, derivatives, stimulants, etc., are\\n      sometimes advised without explicit mention, and in other cases Cod-liver\\n      oil, Iron Quinine, Arsenic, Malt and Hypophosphites, especially in anaemic\\n      debility, scrofulosis, etc.\\n      \\n The following table shoes a list of\\n      other medicines mentioned, and the diseases for which they are\\n      recommended.\\n      \\n Diuretics and Purgatives, especially\\n      Rhubarb and Sada, Sal sada, Rochelle salts.-Phlyctenular keratitis,\\n      scleritis rheumatica, iritis, cataract, retinitis (apoplectica and\\n      albuminurica), amotio-retinae, neuritis, neuro-retinitis.\\n      \\n Salicylate of Sada, Lithates, Liquor\\n      potash and other alkalies-Rheumatic and gouty affections generally,\\n      particularly in iritis, neuritis, neuro-retinitis, periostitis,\\n      tendonitis, acute phlegmonous eczema of the lids, staphyloma of the\\n      sclera.\\n      \\n Antifebrine, Antipyrine, Sulphonal,\\n      Morphia, Opium, Bromides, Chloral and Phenacetine.-To relieve pain.\\n      \\n Iodide of potash. -Spasm of\\n      orbicularis, episcleritis, iritis, to arrest development of cataract, to\\n      clear opacities of the vitreous, choroiditis, retinitis, atrophy of the\\n      optic nerve, periostitis orbitae, tendonitis, generally in syphilitic and\\n      rheumatic affections.\\n      \\n Mercury.-Syphilitic affections,\\n      diphtheritic conjunctivitis, interstitial keratitis, iritis, opacities of\\n      vitreous, sympathetic ophthalmia, choroiditis, acute and chronic,\\n      retinitis albuminurica. neuritis, neuroretinitis, atrophy of the optic\\n      nerve.\\n      \\n Arsenic, Zinc, Argentum nitricum,\\n      Phosphorus.-Various affections of the nerve and retina.\\n      \\n Strychnia.-Neuro-paralytic ophthalmia,\\n      cataract, retinitis pigmentosa, amblyopia, amaurosis (genuine and\\n      hysterical), exophthalmic goitre.\\n      \\n Digitalis, Phosphoric acid, Ergot,\\n      Atropia, Strophanthus, Tonics and Sedatives.-Exophthalmic goitre.\\n      \\n Digitalis.-Diseases characterized by\\n      feeble circulation and weak heart, such as ischaemia retinae, retinitis\\n      albuminurica, with vascular degeneration (also calling for Carbonate of\\n      ammonia), amblyopia, amaurosis.\\n      \\n Muriate of pilocarpine, Infusion of\\n      jaborandi.-Amotio- retinae, staphyloma of sclera (in gouty patients),\\n      iritis, sympathetic ophthalmia, acute choroiditis, neuritis, neuro-\\n      retinitis.\\n      \\n Quinine.-To check threatened\\n      inflammation after cataract operations, cellulitis, iritis.\\n      \\n Aconite, Gelsemium,\\n      Conium.-Blepharospasm.\\n      \\n Bromo coffein.-Hysterical amblyopia.\\n      \\n Nitro-glycerine in 1/100 gr.\\n      doses.-Retinitis apoplectica with high arterial tension.\\n      \\n Mineral acids.-Cellulitis orbitae.\\n      \\n Turpentine, Colchicum. -Iritis.\\n      \\n Phosphoric acids, Phosphates.-Cataract.\\n      \\n I believe this to be a fair and\\n      impartial resume of ophthalmic therapeutics from the Old School point of\\n      view. It is not difficult to recognize the unconscious Homoeopathicity of\\n      many of their more specific applications; at least, we use the same drugs\\n      in attenuated doses, with success, in the same disease, only studying the\\n      particular and minute indications for them according to the law of\\n      \"similia.\" The essential difference between their therapeutics\\n      and ours is noticed here as in all departments of medicine, viz., they\\n      prescribe for diseases while we prescribe for the individual. Which is the\\n      more scientific?.\\n      \\n In contrast with this array, I will\\n      simply call attention to the detailed and specific symptomatology of the\\n      one hundred and forty remedies mentioned in the latest and best\\n      Homoeopathic treatise, that of Dr. Norton, already mentioned. While this\\n      list does not comprise all the resources of our school-for almost every\\n      remedy in the Materia Medica may be found curative of eye diseases under\\n      appropriate conditions-I offer it as a fair exponent of Homoeopathic\\n      treatment in contrast with the resume of Old-School therapeutics just\\n      given. It is not a compilation of theoretical and empirical indications,\\n      but is made up of thoroughly trustworthy and, for the most part, verified\\n      indications. Experience has demonstrated them to be reliable guides for\\n      the choice of the remedy. But it may be argued that this is mere\\n      assumption on my part. It certainly would be presumptuous to expect any\\n      one to accept such an assertion without satisfactory evidence, and while I\\n      cannot demonstrate to the sceptic here and now the truth of my statement\\n      by adducing overwhelming evidence in proof of the value of remedies\\n      prescribed upon such a basis, yet I can affirm what the Homoeopathic\\n      treatment of eye diseases has accomplished, what it is accomplishing every\\n      day in hospital and private practice, and what can be demonstrated to the\\n      satisfaction of any fair-minded investigator who cares to give the matter\\n      sufficient time and thought.\\n      \\n What, then, are some of the verities of\\n      Homoeopathic ocular therapeutics?.\\n      \\n I. -The action of constitutional\\n      remedies, such as Ars., Graph., Calc., Sulph., Nut.mur, and Sil. in\\n      hereditary or acquired conditions of malnutrition and in the various\\n      dyscrasiae.\\n      \\n II. -The action of Acon., Bell., Apis.,\\n      Verat. vir. and Rhus in controlling inflammatory conditions, erysipelas,\\n      cellulitis, etc.\\n      \\n III. -The action of Hepar, Sil. and\\n      Rhus in suppuration, of Gels. in serous, and absorbing haemorrhages.\\n      \\n IV. -The action of Arnica, Crotalus,\\n      Ham., Lach., and Ledum in arresting and absorbing haemorrhages.\\n      \\n V. -The action of Sil., Calc., Aurum.,\\n      Kali iodide, etc., in diseases of bone and orbit, morbid growths,\\n      periostitis, etc.\\n      \\n VI. -The action of Amyl nit., Ferrum.,\\n      Lycopus, Spongia, Nat.mur, and Ars. in exophthalmic goitre.\\n      \\n VII. -The action of Puls., Apis.,\\n      Alum., Merc., Ars., Euphrasia, Argent. nit., Rhus., etc., in catarrhal\\n      conjunctivitis, ophthalmia neonatorum, specific blenorrhoea, etc.,\\n      arresting inflammation, moderating discharge, preventing corneal\\n      complications and averting many cases of blindness.\\n      \\n VIII. -The action of Aurum., the\\n      Iodides, Baryta, the Kalis, Sil., Graph., Hepar., and Merc., on corneal\\n      tissue, healing ulcers, resolving infiltrations, clearing nebulae, and\\n      thus often avoiding minor operations, such as scraping of ulcers and\\n      phlyctenules, the use of caustics and the galvanic cautery, and of\\n      paracentesis.\\n      \\n IX. -The influence of Merc., Bry.,\\n      Cedron, Rhus, Clem., Col., Spigelia and Potash in iritis, shortening very\\n      much its course under Old-School methods, averting sequelae and rendering\\n      narcotics unnecessary.\\n      \\n X. -The undoubted influence of Caust.,\\n      Sulph., Sepia, Phos., Sil. and Iodoform in arresting and delaying the\\n      development of cataract, and even clearing opacities of cortex.\\n      \\n XI. -The influence of Bell., Bry.,\\n      Gels., Aurum., Phos., Merc., Kali mur. and Kali iod. in various forms of\\n      choroiditis and retinitis.\\n      \\n XII. -The beneficial effects of many\\n      remedies, especially of Nux and Phos., in inflammatory affections of the\\n      optic nerve and in atrophic conditions, cerebral and spinal.\\n      \\n These are some of the solid facts of\\n      Homoeopathic therapeutics which cannot be controverted.\\n      \\n As our knowledge of Materia Medica\\n      increases, especially as the pathogeneses of drugs are more accurately and\\n      scientifically developed, our success will be measurably increased. There\\n      is some evidence as to the efficiency of Gels., Bry., Col., and other\\n      remedies in glaucoma, but the well-known influence of eserine and\\n      iridectomy makes it unjustifiable to withhold them in the majority of\\n      cases. The symptomatology of Osmium gives us a very suggestive picture of\\n      glaucoma. It ought to be helpful, though I am not conversant with any\\n      positive clinical evidence in proof of its efficacy. When a careful record\\n      of the tension, of the acuity and of the field of vision and of the\\n      ophthalmoscopic appearance of the fundus appears in our provings, then we\\n      may hope to dispense with myotics and iridectomy in the treatment of this\\n      disease.\\n      \\n The influence of some of our remedies\\n      in checking the development of cataract, and of materially improving\\n      vision by the resolution of cortical opacities has been abundantly proved,\\n      and affords a striking instance of the superiority of Homoeopathic ocular\\n      therapeutics. Where do we find any such results from Old-School treatment\\n      as those published in recent years by some of our specialists of\\n      recognized ability, whose statements are trustworthy, and whose diagnoses\\n      are beyond question? The experience of Dr. Wm. R. King, [See Journal of\\n      O., and L., April, 1891.] of Washington, with Iodoform is especially\\n      noteworthy.\\n      \\n The treatment of cataract with remedies\\n      must, of course, rest upon a constitutional basis. Eye-symptoms alone do\\n      not afford sufficient data for the choice of a drug. The underlying\\n      condition is the important point to consider.\\n      \\n An interesting illustration of the\\n      value of such a method of prescribing, and also of the fact previously\\n      noted, that a remedy may cure an eye-affection when indicated by\\n      constitutional symptoms, even though its pathogenesis contains nothing to\\n      indicate its special action on the eye, is afforded by a case of ptosis\\n      cured with Bromine 6x by Dr. Bissell, of Rochester, reported in the\\n      Journal of O., O. and L., for October, 1889. Bromine was selected on\\n      account of diarrhoea, eructations, pain like needles at the epigastrium\\n      and physometra.\\n      \\n Bisulphide of carbon is worthy of trial\\n      in retrobulbar neuritis. Cases of poisoning suggest it Homoeopathically to\\n      this affection. It has produced in several cases, \"diminution of\\n      vision, central scotoma, vision better in the evening, loss of\\n      appreciation of color, central scotoma for colors, and narrowing of\\n      eccentric field,\" without ophthalmic changes in the fundus oculi.\\n      Hirshberge described in one case \"an alteration of the macula\\n      characterized by the presence of whitish nodules.\" These visual\\n      disturbances are associated with nervous symptoms, such as muscular\\n      weakness of the limbs, cramps in the legs and abdomen, diminution of\\n      hearing and headache. [See article by H.H. Crippen in O., O, and L.,\\n      April, 1891].\\n      \\n Malignant growths of the eye and lids\\n      have seldom been materially influenced by remedies, yet we now and then\\n      see a gleam of light in this direction which encourages us to hope for\\n      better results in the future. Such hints from accurate observers should be\\n      carefully noted and remembered, and therefore I desire to call your\\n      attention to the report of a case of sarcoma by Dr. W.S. Searle, of\\n      Brooklyn. [+ Journal of O., O. and L., February, 1892.] A blind eye had\\n      been removed, and microscopical examination demonstrated the correctness\\n      of a previous diagnosis by Dr. H. Knapp, viz., spindle-called sarcoma of\\n      the choroid. Ten days after removal, a secondary growth \"of the size\\n      of a chestnut\" was removed from the orbit, and Phos. and Tarentula\\n      cubensis were prescribed. The former was chosen on account of general\\n      constitutional indications, and the latter from its reputation in\\n      inflammatory affections of connective tissue, especially in boils and\\n      carbuncles. After their use there was no return for nine months. Then the\\n      growth again returned to as light extent, but under a renewal of the\\n      former prescription the nodule shrivelled and dropped off within a week,\\n      and the doctor wrote me recently that there had been no recurrence of the\\n      disease up to present time, a period of two years since the second\\n      operation.\\n      \\n These remedies are worthy of trial in\\n      similar cases, and i would also remind you of the published experience of\\n      the late Dr. George S. Norton and of Dr. French in the treatment of glioma\\n      retinae with Ceanothus Americanus, the fluid extract of red clover\\n      blossoms. [See O., O. and L., April, 1890, and Trans. Am. Inst, 1884.].\\n      \\n The value of Cinnabar as a remedy for\\n      ciliary neuralgias has been often demonstrated, where the indication of\\n      \"pain extending from the inner canthus around the brow\" is\\n      present, but we owe to Dr. H.C. French a confirmation of the following\\n      indication for its employment, viz., \"a full, heavy feeling in the\\n      whole head, temporarily lessened by pressure.\" \"Shooting pains\\n      in the forehead.\" \"Sticking and itching in both canthi and in\\n      the forehead.\" The patient had been under Old-School treatment for\\n      two years, and Dr. French gave him great relief in a few hours, and cured\\n      him in less than three weeks with Cinnabar.\\n      \\n The curative influence of Agaricus in\\n      spasmodic affections of the lids and ocular muscles has log been\\n      recognized, but its influence in amaurosis and hysterical amblyopia was\\n      first suggested to me by an article by Dr. Rounds. [+ See Journal of O.,\\n      O. and L., October, 1891.] Some slight impairment of vision is suggested\\n      in the proving of the remedy, but that a total blindness of both\\n      eyes-\"only slight perception of strong light remaining\"-should\\n      be entirely cured, and perfect vision restored after the patient had been\\n      blind for several years, is certainly surprising and worthy of note. The\\n      sight of the right eye was suddenly lost after a blow upon the head four\\n      years before treatment was commenced, and that of the left eye as suddenly\\n      and completely failed after exposure to rain. For two years she could not\\n      tell night from day. The only other treatment employed was galvanism, and\\n      as this was used without avail for two months before prescribing Agaricus\\n      it seems reasonable to attribute the recovery in large measure to the\\n      medicine, although electricity was continued at irregular and increasing\\n      intervals during the time of treatment. Nystagmus, nictitation and other\\n      nervous and hysterical symptoms led to the choice. The ophthalmoscopic\\n      examination was negative. Fifteen drops of the tincture of Agaricus were\\n      taken daily in divided doses for a period of eight months, when the\\n      patient was discharged with perfect vision in each eye, and entirely free\\n      from nystagmus, etc. She has since earned her own living as a stenographer\\n      and typewriter.\\n      \\n Experience has repeatedly proved the\\n      efficacy of Gelsemium in various diseases of the eye, especially where\\n      serous exudation exists, and in paretic affection of the muscles, but Its\\n      Homoeopathicity to amaurotic affections is suggested by the following\\n      observation of Dr. W.A.

In a certain patient, 5 gtts. doses of\\n      the tincture invariably produced the characteristic symptoms of giddiness,\\n      headache and heaviness of the lids, followed by almost total loss of\\n      vision. At one time the accommodation failed first, while at another the\\n      sensibility to retinal impression seemed to precede the loss of\\n      adjustment. In forty minutes after the five drops were taken the vision\\n      was reduced to 3/200. It could not be improved by lenses, and this\\n      diminution continued from five to fifteen minutes. Normal vision returned\\n      in from one-half to two hours.

BUFFUM, M.D.: Dr. Linnell has\\n      presented to the Congress an able epitome of the present status of\\n      ophthalmic therapeutics, which must carry with it the conviction of truth.\\n      Perhaps, in no department of medicine have such advances been made in\\n      diagnosis, prognosis, and pathology, as in that of ophthalmology, until it\\n      has now become one of the most exact and scientific in the domain of the\\n      healing art.\\n      \\n Small as the organs of sight are, as\\n      compared with other organs of the human body, their relation to the whole\\n      animal economy is such as to carry with it need for a full knowledge of\\n      not only the anatomy, physiology, and pathology, of all organs, but also\\n      their dependence, in health or disease, to the various affections of the\\n      eye. On the other hand, the ophthalmologist has been able to determine the\\n      exact relation which certain conditions of the eye, either physiological\\n      or pathological, bear to various diseases which are termed reflex and\\n      general.\\n      \\n As Homoeopathic ophthalmologists, we\\n      should carry our Homoeopathy into our practice, not only as followers of\\n      the wisdom and philosophy which emanated from Hahnemann, who gave us a\\n      universal law of cure, but also, because we owe it to our clients who\\n      confide their cases to us and expect to be cured homoeopathically,\\n      primarily, and secondarily only, when we have failed from a want of\\n      knowledge of our Materia Medica Pura.\\n      \\n The ophthalmic practitioner of our\\n      school has had, until the last few years, but little to aid or encourage\\n      him in his adherence to the tenets of his faith, owing to the fact that\\n      the basis of his knowledge of drugs in their active relation to eye\\n      diseases has been uncertain, as too often the pathogenesis, as set forth\\n      in the provings of the remedies was found thoroughly unreliable when\\n      applied to the treatment of the eye.\\n      \\n Hence, the older ophthalmic surgeons of\\n      our school have had to acquire from close study and observation of the\\n      clinical effect of our drugs, a system of ophthalmic therapeutics derived\\n      from our knowledge of our Materia Medica, and their own clinical\\n      observation, which is now rapidly being augmented by the increased number\\n      of workers in this department. Eventually, in the coming years, when the\\n      true laborers in the field of Homoeopathic, ocular therapy have brought in\\n      the harvest of pathogenetic, clinical, and curative symptoms, we shall\\n      find, when the grain is separated from the chaff, that but little remains\\n      to desire, save the proper application of this accumulated knowledge to\\n      the scientific Homoeopathic cure of all ophthalmic diseases.\\n      \\n It is difficult supplement the careful\\n      resume of the verified action and indications of the homoeopathic remedies\\n      which have so ably been demonstrated in the paper which is before us for\\n      discussion. Dr. Linnell has, with the utmost care, culled from our\\n      literature the most valuable verifications of Homoeopathy as applied to\\n      the treatment of ocular diseases. It remains, then, only for me to add\\n      what may have come to may knowledge as result of my own individual\\n      experience and observation in ophthalmic practice; amplifying here and\\n      there, and presenting perhaps, now and then a grain of pure gold, which\\n      years of study and observation have enabled me to separate fro the dross\\n      which surrounded it.\\n      \\n The poverty of the armamentarium\\n      medicum of the Old-School, in its application to ocular therapeutics is\\n      manifested, not so much in its lessened number of drugs for internal\\n      medication, as in the want of specific indications for their use. The\\n      richness of our drug armament stands out in glittering contrast, not\\n      perhaps by the greater number of remedies, but by the knowledge of our\\n      Homoeopathic law which enables us to prescribe these drugs with an\\n      assurance of the curative results which inevitably must follow their\\n      proper administration.\\n      \\n It is not necessary to discuss seriatim\\n      the list of verities of Homoeopathic ocular therapeutics which Dr. Linnell\\n      has presented, as they are no longer in doubt. We should all endeavor, as\\n      soon as possible, to increase their number by adding to those mentioned\\n      other rich in possibilities, but which yet lack that confirmation which\\n      must come from repeated trials.\\n      \\n In the list presented I desire to\\n      emphasize the actions of Homoeopathic so-called constitutional remedies in\\n      lessening and dissipating the various dyscrasias mentioned, and thus\\n      enabling us to cure the alternate effects as exhibited in the eye.\\n      \\n The actions of those remedies mentioned\\n      as controlling inflammatory effects of the eye, we all daily prove the\\n      truth of in our practice.\\n      \\n In reference to the action of Rhus tox.\\n      in promoting, controlling, and limiting various traumatic and surgical\\n      inflammations, perhaps little need be said, but for Hepar sulph. which has\\n      exhibited such marvelous action in controlling, limiting, and absorbing\\n      pus within the eye, too much praise cannot to given. With these two\\n      remedies eyesight and eyeball have been saved time and again, when no\\n      other known treatment could possibly have controlled the inflammation,\\n      lessened the pain, saved tissue, and caused the absorption of the products\\n      of inflammatory attacks. To watch the action of either, when indicated in\\n      these affections of the eye makes one feel that our remedies have an\\n      action only short of the miraculous.\\n      \\n In iritis the action of Terebinth,\\n      which, in the Old School, finds a place of value, is with us too often\\n      neglected, as, like Asafoetida, it has a specific action upon the inflamed\\n      iris, and both not only lessen the ciliary neuralgia but shorten and cure\\n      the attack.\\n      \\n In controlling the inflammatory and\\n      degenerative changes in the lens which result in cataract, the action of\\n      our remedies presents often in my experience the further proof of the\\n      Homoeopathic law of cure.\\n      \\n In the lens, as well as in the cornea,\\n      iris, vitreous, retina, and choroid, we can watch from day to day the\\n      limiting, absorption, and sight-restoring effects of our remedies.\\n      \\n Glaucoma, when presenting a mechanical\\n      obstruction of the excretion of the fluids of the eye, cannot come under\\n      the domain of medicine; but for those glaucomatous conditions which are\\n      dependent upon the hypersecretions resulting from neurotic irritations,\\n      the remedies mentioned by Dr. Linnell often afford us brilliant results.\\n      In simple non-inflammatory glaucoma of chronic type, Sulphur, Nux vomica,\\n      and Phosphorus have controlled the disease and saved the vision in cases\\n      where neither iridectomy, sclerotomy, or myotomy had been allowed, and\\n      also in cases where some or all of these operations had been made without\\n      control of this sight-destroying disease.\\n      \\n In addition to those that have been\\n      mentioned in the paper, there are some affections of the eye and the\\n      therapeutic means for their relief to which I desire to call attention as\\n      exhibiting the desired action of our remedies.\\n      \\n Hyperaemia of the retina, while usually\\n      symptomatic, is, I believe, more often idiopathic than we are inclined to\\n      think. While this condition is difficult of diagnosis, owing to the\\n      variableness of the circulation of the retina within physiological limits\\n      of the individuals, and in cases where such immediate causes as refractive\\n      errors, foreign bodies, or inflammation of the contiguous tissues of the\\n      choroid and iris have been excluded, we are justified in making such a\\n      diagnosis. I find that taking the increased capillary circulation of the\\n      optic disk as an indication, rather than that of the retinal vessels,\\n      together with the subjective symptoms of asthenopia, a safe guide to the\\n      diagnosis of a condition which often presents a series of symptoms\\n      extremely annoying to the patient and often difficult of relief, unless we\\n      find in such remedies as Belladonna, Cactus, Cimicifuga, Duboisia, Amyl\\n      nit., and Phosphorus the similimum.\\n      \\n Cases of temporary amblyopia which\\n      arise from spasm of the retinal arteries or result from vaso-motor\\n      irritation of the cerebroretinal circulation, and thus temporarily disturb\\n      the nutrition of the optic nerve and retina and destroy its function, more\\n      frequently once to the notice of the general practitioner than to the\\n      ophthalmologist.\\n      \\n Such amblyopias, while often temporary\\n      and symptomatic of the cephalalgia which follows, sometimes tend to be\\n      persistent, and even when the amblyopia has disappeared we may find\\n      scotomas, which become sources of discomfort or causes of subjective\\n      symptoms, which make difficult the diagnosis of the eye condition.\\n      \\n In these cases, where there is found a\\n      migraine history, recent or remote, there are three remedies which cover a\\n      multitude of discomforting symptoms, namely, Gelsemium, Physostigma, and\\n      Strychnia phos. .\\n      \\n For the amblyopia which precedes the\\n      attacks of headache, and which itself is often preceded by symptoms, more\\n      or less marked, of irritation of the retina, perhaps no remedy is more\\n      valuable the an Amyl nitrite by inhalation, which, while shortening the\\n      attack as far as the disturbance of the vision is concerned, yet lessens\\n      not the tendency to recurrence nor removes the cause. As an example of\\n      what may be accomplished by remedies which, as far as we know, have shown\\n      in their pathogenesis no direct action upon such conditions yet exhibit\\n      their curative powers in a remarkable degree, I take from my case book the\\n      following record of Miss P. aet. 23, who consulted me in 1888, with a\\n      history of temporary amblyopia, which usually occurred only in the right\\n      eye, but occasionally in the left, the attacks coming or in the morning\\n      after breakfast of on awakening, if she had suffered from insomnia. During\\n      the years before consulting me she had had six attacks, whose duration\\n      lasted from an hour to four or five. At the time I saw her a central\\n      scotoma of the right eye was evident, but a diagnosis of circulatory\\n      changes in the eye was doubtful in the inception of the attack, a point of\\n      light was observed by her on the temporal side, which increased until it\\n      became a wave of light. In some of the attacks modified by lying down. Her\\n      eyes were emmetropic and the vision normal. Has no special headaches.\\n      Bryonia was prescribed, and there was no return of the trouble for a year,\\n      when she again had a recurrence of the trouble, and came for some more of\\n      the remedy. In the four years since there has been no return of the\\n      troubles.\\n      \\n Some sixteen years ago, after reading\\n      the experience of Bell and Kuhne in their efforts to demonstrate the\\n      retinal purple, I was impressed with the fact that Muscarine and\\n      Pilocarpine seemed to have the peculiar property of increasing the\\n      secretions of the light discoloring matter which is formed about the base\\n      of the rods of the retina. Acting upon the suggestions thus presented by\\n      the physiological provings of these drugs, I have use them for many years\\n      with success in cases of amblyopia, where I have been able to determine by\\n      exclusion of other causes that the deficient vision was dependent upon a\\n      probable functional derangement of the retina and optic nerve. While I\\n      have already reported the good results following the administration of\\n      Agaricus and Jaborandi in restoring the vision in many cases of what might\\n      be termed torpor-retinae of functional anaesthesia, I have also observed\\n      that Agaricus has a curative result in cases of of hyperaesthesia retinae.\\n      In regard to the action of Agaricus in optic nerve atrophy, I regret to\\n      say that I have been unable to get in improvement in the vision from its\\n      use. Some cases of toxic amblyopia arising from nicotine poisoning, where\\n      the atrophy was only partial, have certainly been benefited by it. Such\\n      remedies as Gelsemium, Ignatia, Phosphorus, Sulphur, and many others might\\n      also be mentioned as having directly or indirectly a marked action in\\n      improving the functional activity of the retina. In hyperaesthetic\\n      conditions of the retina, where all local, refractive, and reflex causes\\n      have been removed, the action of the Homoeopathic attenuated drugs, such\\n      as Macrotin, Hyoscyamine, Atropine, Conium, Agaricus, Nux vomica, and\\n      Ignatia, are often marvelous in the rapidity of their action. The results\\n      obtained from the proper administration of the indicated remedies in these\\n      cases where the failure from the more general treatment of the opposing\\n      school of medicine is common, are the more remarkable, and tend to give\\n      one new effort and a desire to place again and again fresh laurels upon\\n      the already well crowned head of Hahnemann.\\n      \\n The results obtained by the\\n      Homoeopathic administration of Physostigma, Jaborandi, Gelsemium,\\n      Agaricus, in cases of spasm of the accommodation associated with\\n      refractive errors, have enabled me for the last ten years to do away with\\n      the use of Atropia, Homatropine, Hyoscyamine, and other mydriatics which\\n      are commonly considered necessary for the paralysis of the accommodation\\n      in the prescription of glasses. It has been my experience that the results\\n      of my prescriptions for correcting lenses have been much more satisfactory\\n      than when I have used mydriatics, and where the reflex symptoms arising\\n      from eye-strain, such as neuralgia and headaches and other more remote\\n      neuroses, were often relieved before the glasses were prescribed.\\n      \\n Again, it may be said that these and\\n      other remedies relieve the eye stain of both the intrinsic and extrinsic\\n      muscles of the ball, as reflexes, when the total optical defect has been\\n      corrected by the prescription of glasses, based upon the supposed complete\\n      paralysis of the accommodation under Atropia or some other drug similar in\\n      action.\\n      \\n In the insufficiencies of the recti\\n      muscles, whether the cases exhibit an exophoria, esophoria, or a\\n      hyperphoria, we find that a close study of our cases with the prescription\\n      of such remedies as Argent.nit., Nat.mur., Gels., Senega, Physostigma,\\n      Agaricus, Mercurius, and Phosphorus, we are time and again not only to\\n      relieve the discomfort attendant upon the muscular deficiency, but also to\\n      avoid the aftermath of graduated tenotomies which daily confront us in\\n      search of relief which even our Homoeopathic law cannot repair. Thanks to\\n      the increasing intelligence of the medical profession the fad of to-day,\\n      whether in our department of medicine or in any other, is dead to-morrow,\\n      but while our colleagues in general medicine and surgery may bury their\\n      dead, ours too often with practically useless organs of sight confront us\\n      with their tale of woe in their tenotomized and be-prismed eyes.\\n      \\n Careful study, the painstaking\\n      prescription of the Homoeopathic remedy in our department of medicine, not\\n      only gives us the satisfaction of cure where other methods have failed,\\n      but also enables us to thus make a more enduring monument to Hahnemann\\n      than that of bronze which we design to erect to him.\\n      \\n F. PARKE LEWIS, M.D.: Mr. President,\\n      Ladies and Gentlemen: Everything that Dr. Linnell writes is written with\\n      care. I never yet have seen anything from his pen that was not truly worth\\n      reading. It follows, as a matter of course, that the summary of the value\\n      of drugs which he has given us is one which has a very definite and\\n      distinct value. The thesis of this paper, however, is one in which in an\\n      interrogatory way he asks us if we may not accept. It is this: He says:\\n      \"Knowing that certain constitutional symptoms are accompanied with\\n      morbid conditions, and having cured this condition by the exhibition of\\n      the similimum, are we not justified in saying that any subsequent case, in\\n      which the morbid condition the eye alone appears, we may assume that had\\n      the drug in the proving been given long enough the condition of the eye\\n      would have disappeared, and that we may take that as a basis for\\n      subsequent precipitations of that drug?\" Can we? I wish I could\\n      believe absolutely that that were true, because it would give us a basis\\n      for the exhibition of our Homoeopathic remedies, a very true and very sure\\n      one. In other words, if it were always possible to say that because\\n      certain conditions have been cured by the exhibition of a certain remedy,\\n      we may assume that when these conditions of the eye appear independent of\\n      the constitutional conditions that appear in the first place, that we will\\n      also cure that disease. I think we would have a certainty in the\\n      application of our Materia Medica that to say I do not always feel, and I\\n      question whether we may accept in its entirely the thesis of Dr. Linnell\\'s\\n      paper. The case in cites, for instance, of Dr. Bissell\\'s, is it seems to\\n      me, a classical one. Bromium was given for certain constitutional\\n      troubles, accompanied by ptosis- the ptosis disappeared. We had a definite\\n      Homoeopathic prescription, followed by a cure; but are we justified in\\n      presuming that, should ptosis appear without these constitutional\\n      symptoms, Bromium is going to cure that Ptosis? I do not believe that we\\n      can always do that. The consequence is that we have in our Materia Medica\\n      a great many symptoms which we accept as verifications, about which, in my\\n      mind, there is question. Immensely valuable suggestions, immensely\\n      valuable to us in our prescriptions, but not symptoms upon which we can\\n      pin our faith with absolute reliance. For instance, I have frequently\\n      given Gelsemium in iritis, and have not cured my case; therefore I have\\n      concluded that Gelsemium is not the remedy for iritis. It may be, but it\\n      is not always. The reason I believe that we have such a small proportion\\n      of definite symptoms connected with the eye in our Materia Medica, is only\\n      partially due to the fact that we have not had skilled specialists to make\\n      examinations of these conditions; it is only partially due to that. I come\\n      more and more to believe that the eyes is not, in a very large proportion\\n      of cases, directly and specifically acted upon by drugs administered\\n      internally. I wish to be understood in this matter. I am not in any degree\\n      under-estimating the immense value of Homoeopathic therapeutics in\\n      diseases of the eyes; I am simply questioning the application of this\\n      therapeutics. I am by no means criticising the results which have been\\n      obtained in the hands of our careful prescribers. That those results have\\n      been obtained, I also have no doubt; but I do believe that a large\\n      proportion of the diseases of the eye (if we exclude traumatism,\\n      refractive and muscular troubles-I mean traumatism of bright sunlight on\\n      the retina)-are the results of diseases of some of the other organs of the\\n      system; some of the great organs of the nervous system, or of the\\n      circulatory system. And unless we take into account the power which each\\n      of these conditions may have upon the disease of the eye, I am inclined to\\n      think that we lessen rather than increase our knowledge of the therapeutic\\n      action of drugs upon the eye. I hope I make myself hear in that, because I\\n      have such an unbounded faith in Homoeopathic remedies in diseases of the\\n      eye that I do not wish to be wrongly understood in the matter. But as to\\n      the methods we sometimes adopt in determining the action of drugs upon the\\n      eye, I think there is room for frequent error. It is unnecessary to talk\\n      to those who are thoroughly informed-as thoroughly informed as those are\\n      to whom I am speaking-in regard to the nature of diseases of the eye, and\\n      the necessity of exact diagnosis; and yet I believe that in the\\n      administration of drugs therapeutically, an exceedingly exact diagnosis\\n      must be made, otherwise we are apt to be led into error. To explain what I\\n      mean more particularly: I remember trying for a long time to treat a\\n      peculiar form of cataract (a dotted condition of the lens, which I have\\n      seen in several instances), and without any appreciable effect. I\\n      subsequently found that there was present in that case a refractive\\n      condition, which had been overlooked, a slight difference in the foci of\\n      the two eyes, and the correction of which absolutely corrected the whole\\n      difficulty. In other words, it relieved the strain on the ciliary muscle,\\n      it relieved the nutrition of the eye, and the eye cleared in consequence.\\n      I don\\'t mean to say that that kind of cataract come inevitably as a result\\n      of muscular or ciliary strain, but I do mean to say that in a very large\\n      proportion of these cases the correction of muscular and of refractive\\n      errors will eliminate the necessity for the exhibition of internal\\n      medication.\\n      \\n I am very much interested in what Dr.\\n      Buffum has said in regard to the action of drugs in relieving and curing\\n      ciliary spasm. I was very much interested twelve or fifteen years ago when\\n      Dr. Woodyatt announced the value that he had obtained for Argentum\\n      nitricum in those troubles, possibly because I have not had opportunity of\\n      following those cases as I would like to; but I never have had the\\n      entirely satisfactory results in internal medication, in focal and\\n      refractive troubles, which others seem to have had. Where there is a\\n      muscular condition which is not benefited, I have almost always found\\n      those conditions return for further treatment.', u'Tresorie - OPHTHALMIC SURGERY [Ophthalmic Surgery]\\n\\n MEDICAL history records no more rapid\\n      and marvelous advancement than has characterized ophthalmology in the past\\n      quarter of a century. During this brief period, spanned even by the\\n      professional career of some who listen to me to-day, there has gradually\\n      developed a science which excels in its perfection and exactness that of\\n      my other department of medicine. From a dark and unexplored chamber the\\n      eye has been transformed into a ball of light, revealing not only what is\\n      within its narrow bounds, but, like a mirror, much that lies outside it.\\n      So vast and important has become the consideration of abnormalities\\n      affecting the visual apparatus, and so wonderful, yet still imperfect, our\\n      facilities for detecting and overcoming these, that when I was asked to\\n      present to this Congress a paper upon ophthalmic surgery and to cover as\\n      much of the field as possible, although less than one-tenth of the\\n      oculist\\'s work is strictly surgical, I thought that volumes could not do\\n      it justice. I shall therefore endeavor to bring before you not only that\\n      which is newest, but that which is most practical. There are endless\\n      unique operations for rare and complicated cases, but they must of\\n      necessity be passed by, and only those surgical procedures be presented\\n      which will most frequently tax our thought and skill. By Thus limiting the\\n      scope of this paper, I hope to elicit a more general and definite\\n      discussion.\\n      \\n Aside from a better understanding of\\n      the anatomy and physiology of the eye and an improved technique in may\\n      operations, three elements-perfected instruments, local anaesthesia by\\n      cocaine, and absolute cleanliness secured either by simple irrigation or\\n      antiseptic agents-contribute largely toward accomplishing better surgical\\n      results than formerly.\\n      \\n Aside from a better understanding of\\n      the anatomy and physiology of the eye and an improved technique in many\\n      operations, three elements-perfected instruments, local anaesthesia by\\n      cocaine, and absolute cleanliness secured either by simple irrigation or\\n      antiseptic agents-contribute largely toward accomplishing better surgical\\n      results than formerly.\\n      \\n Great improvement has been made in the\\n      character and quality of our instruments. I think we are under obligation\\n      to the manufacturers for furnishing us such delicate instruments, perfect\\n      in adjustment and yet easily rendered aseptic.\\n      \\n A wonderful boon came to ophthalmic\\n      surgery in the introduction of cocaine. By it we not only are enabled to\\n      secure anaesthesia limited to the parts to be operated upon, but other\\n      quite as desirable and important effects. I refer particularly to its\\n      power to contract the blood vessels, so that less haemorrhage obscures our\\n      work during such operations as tenotomy or advancement for strabismus; and\\n      to its action in producing hypotony, a certain degree of which is a great\\n      factor in the extraction of cataract. I think more attention should be\\n      given to this latter point, because by a careless and unscientific use of\\n      cocaine an unnecessary element of danger is artificially induced in\\n      operations involving the opening of the eyeball. My rule has been to apply\\n      a 2 per cent. solution three or four times during eight minutes in cases\\n      where there was a strong probability that an iridectomy would be\\n      unnecessary, care being taken that the lids are kept closed during\\n      cocainization so as to prevent dryness of the cornea. This strength I have\\n      found to produce sufficient anaesthesia and a degree of hypotony which\\n      favors the delivery of the lens in cataract extraction, and at the same\\n      time aids in preventing prolapse of the iris. In fact, it is this action\\n      on the part of cocaine which has done much to make simple extraction\\n      possible in so many cases. With a 2 per cent, solution I also believe that\\n      a smoother incision can be made, and the healing process goes on more\\n      rapidly and perfectly because the epithelium of the cornea is less\\n      affected than when stronger solution are applied. On the other hand, if\\n      there are indications that in iridectomy will be necessary, or if there is\\n      a slightly increased tension, I employ a 4 per cent. solution and prolong\\n      its action to ten minutes. In operation open the lids or external ocular\\n      muscles I use this same strength. By thus individualizing, we can make\\n      cocaine serve a double purpose.\\n      \\n The third factor in the general\\n      consideration of ophthalmic surgery is antisepsis. The great fact to keep\\n      before us is, that the end to be attained is absolute cleanliness, and I\\n      have no hesitation in saying that if this can be secured and maintained\\n      without the use of chemical germicidal agents, it is much the superior\\n      method, but I do not believe this possible under all circumstances. If the\\n      truth could be known I doubt not that many major operations are\\n      successfully performed when only ordinary, I may say partial cleanliness\\n      has been accomplished and not the theoretical, scientific, absolute\\n      cleanliness which we talk so much about. Possibly there is a practical\\n      surgical cleanliness which is not synonymous with absolute surgical\\n      cleanliness. However, as long as we cannot tell what point less than\\n      perfect cleanliness is safe and practical, we must diligently strive after\\n      the ideal. The fact to be emphasized is that in our enthusiasm to secure a\\n      state of perfect antisepsis, we avoid employing methods or agents\\n      irritating to the eye, which indirectly may do more harm than good. Very\\n      careful discrimination is necessary. The efficiency of an antiseptic agent\\n      is not simply its power to destroy micro-organisms, but to accomplish it\\n      quickly. Many of the drugs which possess truly antiseptic properties are\\n      irritating to the eye when used n sufficient quantity to be effective, and\\n      the question resolves itself into this, whether the dangers are greater in\\n      trying to secure cleanliness by simple irrigation and possibly failure to\\n      accomplish the high ideal, or by using active germicidal agents which\\n      probably prove thoroughly effective, but in many cases cause some\\n      irritation which may mar the result of the operation. This cannot be\\n      satisfactorily answered without going somewhat into detail and bringing\\n      before us a few recent experiments. The list of antiseptic drugs which are\\n      being used in eye surgery is quite long-Carbolic acid, Peroxide of\\n      hydrogen, Pyoktannin, Chlorine water, Boroglyceride, Boracic acid, the\\n      Biniodide and Bichloride of mercury. Some of these are too irritating,\\n      others act too slowly, and Boracic acid has been shown to possess to\\n      germicidal properties, although it is employed as much as any one drug\\n      named. I use it very frequently myself as a means to increase the specific\\n      gravity of liquids used about the eye. If it serves no other purpose than\\n      raising the specific gravity and thus preventing osmosis, it accomplishes\\n      great good. The most effective and at the same time the safest germicide\\n      is the Bichloride of mercury. In strengths varying from one to five\\n      thousand to one to fifteen thousand, it quickly destroys microorganisms,\\n      but when the anterior chamber is opened, there is a possibility of its\\n      inducing striped keratitis, resulting impermanent opacity of the cornea.\\n      The experiments of Carl Mellinger go to prove the following facts;.\\n      \\n First.-That a solution of corrosive\\n      sublimate, 1 to 5000, and even 1 to 15,000, if present in the anterior\\n      chamber for any considerable length of time, will cause permanent opacity\\n      of the cornea.\\n      \\n Second-That cocaine alone produces no\\n      corneal opacity, but that its presence within the anterior chamber\\n      increases the effect of the sublimate solution by making the endothelium\\n      more permeable. Its use, also, by lowering the tension, favors the\\n      retaining of these solutions within the eyeball.\\n      \\n Third.-That a 3 per cent. solution of\\n      boracic acid or a one- half per cent. solution chloride can be injected\\n      into the anterior chamber without any unpleasant results.\\n      \\n My pain of preparing my instruments and\\n      patients for all major operations is as follows: All instruments are\\n      placed in boiling water, to which one-third alcohol is added. They are\\n      allowed to remain a few minute, then dried and transferred to an Arnold\\'s\\n      sterilizer, in which also I place all solutions of cocaine, atropine,\\n      eserine, boracic acid, etc., are in bottles corked with absorbent cotton,\\n      and these, with the instruments, are subjected to sterilization for one\\n      hour. The instruments are then placed in antiseptic absorbent cotton, and\\n      the bottles containing the liquids are not uncorked until necessity\\n      requires it. I could never understand the reasonableness of a surgeon\\n      being so very particular about his instruments, and at the same time (as I\\n      have seen done) employ solutions of cocaine or atropine made up simply\\n      with distilled water, and placed in bottles probably not chemically clean.\\n      Such solutions I do not believe are sterile, and therefore safe to use. In\\n      the preparation of my patient, I have the parts about the eye washed with\\n      soap and water, and in the cleansing of the lid-margins and conjunctival\\n      folds I make the following discrimination: if there are any unhealthy\\n      secretions, such as occur in blepharitis, conjunctivitis, or\\n      dacrocystitis, I employ the bichloride of mercury, 1 to 5000. Special\\n      attention should be given to the cleansing of the cilia and lachrymal sac.\\n      I have never found it necessary to adopt the plan of closing the punata by\\n      the cautery, or to employ Pagenstecher\\'s method of sitting the\\n      canaliculus, and packing with iodoform cotton.\\n      \\n On the other hand, if there are no\\n      unhealthy secretions, I see no necessity of using a germicide, which is\\n      irritating to some eyes, but trust entirely to thorough irrigation with a\\n      2 per cent. sterile boracic acid solution, before, during, and after the\\n      operation. I employ the boracic acid, not because I believe it possesses\\n      any special germicidal properties, but (as i have stated before) to\\n      increase the specific gravity of the liquid. I hold this to be an\\n      important point, if solutions are to be injected into the anterior\\n      chamber. The above plan of antiseptic surgery has given me highly\\n      satisfactory results. Suppuration has been a thing almost unknown, and has\\n      never been of a serious character.\\n      \\n Passing now in brief review some of the\\n      more recent operations which indicate progress in ophthalmic surgery, I\\n      note, first, as one of the most important, the mangle or crushing\\n      operation for trachoma. Dr. David Webster says it is one of the greatest\\n      discoveries of modern ophthalmology. It is certain, however, that by the\\n      judicious employment of this procedure, the poor victims of trachoma are\\n      saved months and even years of suffering and annoyance. Dr. Holtz was the\\n      first, I believe, to attract the attention of the profession to this plan\\n      of treatment; but as he advised the use of the thumb-nails to express the\\n      granules, it was not generally employed until others devised instruments\\n      which rendered it possible to do more thorough and skilled work. The\\n      various instruments which are being used accomplish the same result by\\n      slightly different methods. Dr. Noyes\\'s angular forceps are simply a\\n      squeezing instrument, so constructed as to facilitate the operation well\\n      up in the retro-tarsal folds. Dr. Knapp\\'s roller forceps express the\\n      trachomatous substance by a sort of mangle process. Sometimes, in chronic\\n      inflammatory cases, before using his forceps, he scarifies the infiltrated\\n      parts with the sillonneur of Johnson. Dr. George Lindsay Johnson, the\\n      originator of the sillonneur just referred to, scarifies the everted lids,\\n      and then destroys the granules with an electrolyzer. This plan is superior\\n      to the old cautery treatment. Other instruments have been made, but they\\n      do not differ essentially from those mentioned. In all of the above\\n      methods, general anaesthesia is usually necessary in order to thoroughly\\n      do the operation. The variety or stage of the disease modifies the\\n      character of the operation, and affects, to a considerable extent, the\\n      ultimate result. The most highly satisfactory cures are obtained in\\n      follicular trachoma. There is one point still unsettled: that is, whether\\n      or no better results are secured, when these operations are finished, by\\n      rubbing the lids with a corrosive sublimate solution. I have employed both\\n      methods, and think I have gained quicker results by cleansing (but not\\n      rubbing) the lids with bichloride. In this connection let me state that I\\n      have had very favorable results with \"grattage\" alone, using a\\n      small, stiff brush and the bichloride, 1 to 1000, as advised by Darier,\\n      Von Hippel, and others.\\n      \\n One of the unpleasant complications of\\n      trachoma is blepharospasm. I have relieved two cases of this condition by\\n      stretching the orbicularis with lid-retractors. This operation was first\\n      brought to my notice through am article by Dr. Allport. The lids are held\\n      widely open for five minutes, and the operation repeated on another day if\\n      necessary.\\n      \\n If one subject more than mother has\\n      occupied the thought of ophthalmologists during the past few years, it has\\n      been that regarding the normal and abnormal conditions of the external\\n      ocular muscles. Dr. Harold Wilson will bring before you this subject, so\\n      that there is only one point which is pertinent to this paper. Is surgical\\n      interference necessary in heterophoria? The vast majority of oculists now\\n      answer this in the affirmative for some cases; still there are those yet\\n      who have not got their eyes or ideas straight regarding it. I care not for\\n      your theories; experience has demonstrated beyond the shadow of a doubt\\n      that tenotomy, either complete or partial, is the only means which will\\n      permanently cure many cases. Neither do I think it wise to spend much time\\n      discussing whether a complete or graduated tenotomy is the better surgery.\\n      I start in with a partial tenotomy; I often end the operation by making it\\n      complete. The fact is, when I accomplish factly what I want, I do not\\n      quarrel with the method. I hardly see how I could get along without both\\n      operations. In some cases of esophoria and exophoria, a graduated tenotomy\\n      has proven entirely inadequate; while in slight degrees of heterophoria,\\n      especially hyperphoria, it has given just the result I desired. In a few\\n      cases where, twenty-four, hours after the operation, the eye had returned\\n      to the same relative position as before the tenotomy, I have permanently\\n      improved their condition from one-half to one degree by carefully passing\\n      the Stevens book into the wound and simply re-opening it. No haemorrhage\\n      occurs, and the healing process is only temporarily interfered with. Two\\n      years ago, Dr. Winslow stated that tenotomies changed the corneal\\n      curvature. Since that time I have tested, with Javal\\'s ophthalmometer, a\\n      great many cornea after the operation, and only in one case have I been\\n      able to verify his experience. Dr. Swan M. Burnett has also been searching\\n      for this complication, but writes that he has been unable to discover it.\\n      In the January number of the Archives of Ophthalmology, Dr. Eugene Smith\\n      presents a new method of performing tenotomy. He raises the muscle well up\\n      from the sclerotic with peculiar ring-shaped forceps, and then passes a De\\n      Wecker stop keratome through the conjunctiva and centre of tendon, close\\n      to its attachment. The only advantage over Dr. Stevens\\'s operation is that\\n      less haemorrhage occurs. I have not performed the operation, but should\\n      fear that there would be some danger of passing the lance-shaped keratome\\n      into the sclera.\\n      \\n A few rules have saved to guide me in\\n      my surgical work for heterophoria:.\\n      \\n First.-Carefully, repeatedly, and by\\n      various methods, test the muscles before deciding upon an operation.\\n      \\n Second.-Correct any existing ametropia\\n      and try other plans of treatment first.\\n      \\n Third.-Be reasonably sure that the\\n      defect is symptoms- producing.\\n      \\n Fourth.-Be over-careful to do too\\n      little rather than too much.\\n      \\n My experience has been that tenotomy\\n      for heterophoria, if skilfully performed upon carefully selected cases,\\n      gives more uniformly definite results than any other operation in\\n      ophthalmic surgery.\\n      \\n Closely allied to the surgical work for\\n      heterophoria are the operations for strabismus. Nothing markedly new has\\n      been presented in this field. Dr. Wray has suggested the introduction of a\\n      central suture in advancement operations to take the strain off of the\\n      supra and infra-corneal sutures. Briefly, his method is as follows: One\\n      end of the suture is secured to the stump of the tendon near the cornea;\\n      the other is passed well back so as to transfix from within out of the\\n      muscle and conjunctiva. Over this end of the suture is passed a perforated\\n      shot, and the amount of traction regulated by means of it. It seems as\\n      though this would unnecessarily complicate the operation and annoy the\\n      patient. I am securing uniformly good results in advancement by using Dr.\\n      C. H. Beard\\'s single pulley suture. More perfectly than by any other\\n      operation which I have employed has this method advanced the muscle in the\\n      direct line of its axis.\\n      \\n It has been a reproach upon\\n      opthalmology that so little has been accomplished in removing defects, in\\n      the shape or transparency of the cornea. Transplantation of the cornea has\\n      almost inevitably proven a failure. Galvanism for slight leucoma is far\\n      from satisfactory. Dr. Knapp has lately introduced a new operation for\\n      kerato-conus, which I think is destined to be quite generally employed in\\n      treating this deformity. By means of an oval-tipped electrode he\\n      cauterizes the apex of the kerato-conus. Considerable reaction follows,\\n      but all of his six cases reported were ultimately somewhat improved. The\\n      advantage of a cautery in ulcerations is being more and more appreciated.\\n      I use in my office the Edison current for this purpose, and find that some\\n      of the worst corneal ulcers heal as by magic after through cauterization.\\n      In fact, it is largely displacing Saemisch\\'s incision. I have several\\n      times perforated the cornea, but no bad results have followed.\\n      \\n There are a number of operations which\\n      are in an experimental stage yet and of doubtful expediency. Chief among\\n      them are optico-ciliary neurotomy, resection of the optic nerve and\\n      injection of the bichloride for deep structural changes, such as in\\n      choroiditis.\\n      \\n The last, and still the most important,\\n      operation in ophthalmology which I shall consider, is senile cataract\\n      extraction. This I cannot hope to present in full, but only touch on\\n      certain points, which I trust will elicit discussion. At the present time\\n      no question bearing upon this subject is of greater importance than how to\\n      deal with immature cataracts. Statistics, such as presented by Dr. W.A.\\n      Brailey, show what a small per cent. of cataracts lenses are mature when\\n      first examined. In his practice he found only one in seven, excluding\\n      congenital, zonular and secondary. Of the immature cataracts, 45 per cent.\\n      remained unchanged; 13 per cent. were slightly better; 19 per cent.\\n      slightly worse; and 23 per cent. decidedly worse, the interval of\\n      re-examination varying from three months to eight years. Dr. A.B. Norton\\n      has given us the results of one hundred cases of incipient cataract\\n      treated at this office with Homoeopathic remedies. Forty-two per cent.\\n      remained unchanged; 13 per cent. were improved; 26 per cent. were slightly\\n      worse; and 19 per cent. were decidedly worse. There is a striking\\n      similarity between the results presented by the two surgeons. This goes to\\n      show how hard it is to determine just what is nature and what is drug\\n      effect. Dr. Risley believes that vision can be improved or maintained in\\n      many cases by correcting errors in the refraction and giving attention to\\n      the general health. He emphatically states that increased visual power is\\n      not due to \"the absorption of any opacities already formed in the\\n      lens, but to improved conditions of the vitreous, choroid or\\n      retina.\".\\n      \\n Admitting that there are cases helped\\n      by the Homoeopathic remedy and correcting of the refraction, still there\\n      is large class of immature cataracts in which both of these means are out\\n      of the question. Sufficient vision remains to go about, but not to engage\\n      in the ordinary avocations of life. These are the patients which enlist\\n      our sympathy and tax our skill. Waiting for maturation of the cataract may\\n      mean broken-down health, or poverty, or both. What can be done? Two active\\n      courses can be pursued:.\\n      \\n First.-Remove the immature lens as it\\n      is.\\n      \\n Second.-Artificially mature it and then\\n      remove it.\\n      \\n For myself, I prefer the first plan as\\n      involving less risk. This can be accomplished by two methods, each with a\\n      variety of modification. The one feature which distinctly distinguishes\\n      one from the other is whether or not injections are made into the anterior\\n      chamber. Dr. Tweedy dose not use injections, but performs an iridectomy\\n      and makes a peripheral opening in the capsule with the Grafe knife. He\\n      claims that such a capsulotomy keeps the particles of lens substance,\\n      which cannot be removed, from coming in contact with the iris. Some\\n      surgeons, however, remove a piece of the anterior capsule, and others make\\n      a point of doing a preliminary iridectomy. The method of making intra-\\n      ocular injections is rapidly gaining ground. McKeown, De Wecker, Panus,\\n      Knapp, Lippincott, and many others, are employing it to a considerable\\n      extent. A variety of instruments has been devised for this purpose and a\\n      number of different solutions tried. McKeown has used simply distilled\\n      water in 70 per cent. and Panus\\'s solution in 30 per cent. of his cases.\\n      De Wecker injects a weak solution, and Knapp a one-half per cent. boracic\\n      acid solution, and Knapp a one-half per cent. of sodium chloride. The\\n      bichloride of mercury is not now used because of the discovered danger to\\n      the cornea. I have employed injections ten times. If the lens is very\\n      immature, as it was n six cases, I do an iridectomy; otherwise not. I make\\n      a free laceration of the anterior capsule and inject a warm I per cent.\\n      sterile boracic acid solution. I have not had a single had result.\\n      \\n In two cases V = 20/20. A sharp attack\\n      of iritis followed in one case, but was controlled, and useful vision\\n      resulted. I employ a one-half ounce hypodermic syringe with a sterling\\n      silver tip, and never use the same tip on more than one case. A point made\\n      by Knapp is not to be overlooked; that is, to introduce the nozzle within\\n      the corneal section, so that the liquid will run from within out. This is\\n      disregarded by some, but it seems to me that there is an element of danger\\n      in washing septic matter into the wound.\\n      \\n The second plan, that of artificially\\n      ripening the lens, has many followers: Foerster, McHardy, Noyes, and\\n      others. There are six different ways of accomplishing it:.\\n      \\n First.-Simple division of the anterior\\n      capsule.\\n      \\n Second.-Division of anterior capsule\\n      and iridectomy.\\n      \\n Third.-Division of anterior capsule and\\n      external massage.\\n      \\n Fourth.-Simple paracentesis and\\n      external massage.\\n      \\n Fifth.-Iridectomy and external massage\\n      (Foerster\\'s operation.).\\n      \\n Sixth.-Iridectomy and internal massage.\\n      \\n As the mere mention of these methods so\\n      clearly indicates the work to be done, a fuller description seems\\n      unnecessary.\\n      \\n In operating upon mature or nearly\\n      mature cataracts, the first thing to be decided upon is, shall an\\n      iridectomy be performed? The profession are still divided on this point.\\n      Simple extraction, however, now has the lead, and certainly is the ideal\\n      operation. With a section well in the corneal tissue, prolapse of the\\n      iris-the chief danger-is not a common complication. In extractions, with\\n      an iridectomy, prolapse of the iris into the angles of the wound is nearly\\n      as frequent. Preliminary iridectomy still has its advocates, and it would\\n      be hard to furnish better visual results than they are able to present.\\n      \\n No one method of operating will be\\n      adapted to all cases. We should never sacrifice the best visual results\\n      for the sake of cosmetic appearance. Simple extraction followed by\\n      secondary capsulotomy combines cosmetic effects of cataracts associated\\n      with myopia or slightly increased tension, in which iridectomy gives the\\n      better results.\\n      \\n There is one feature of simple\\n      extraction which has been of interest to me. Formerly I always used\\n      Eserine, a one-half or one per cent. solution immediately after the\\n      delivery of the lens. I have of late largely discarded it. Prolapse of the\\n      iris rarely occurs, less iritis follows, and fewer adhesions between the\\n      iris and capsule remain. When I employ Eserine now, I apply only a\\n      one-fourth per per cent. solution. This causes less irritation. I should\\n      be pleased to know the experience of the members present regarding their\\n      treatment of a prolapsed iris. Some claim to have been able by gentle\\n      manipulation to replace it within the anterior chamber: others abscise it\\n      at once; and Dr. Knapp allows it to remain ten days or longer before\\n      abscising, unless it occurs during the first twenty-four hours after the\\n      extraction.\\n      \\n Regarding the after-treatment and\\n      dressing little need be said here. Nearly every oculist seems to have a\\n      method peculiarly his own. The tendency is markedly toward more freedom\\n      for the patient and more simple dressings for the eye. Some have gone to\\n      the very extreme and practically abandoned the idea of any\\n      after-treatment.\\n      \\n During the past few years a number of\\n      interesting modifications of cataract extraction have appeared, and in\\n      conclusion I will briefly bring to your attention some of them.\\n      \\n Dr. F. Parke Lewis divides the\\n      posterior capsule immediately after the delivery of the lens. He claims\\n      that by so doing, secondary cataracts are less frequent. Dr. Carter adopts\\n      the same procedure, claiming that it prevents the development of glaucoma.\\n      Both Drs. Tyner and Brockman prefer a preliminary peripheral capsulotomy\\n      with a Bowman\\'s stop-needle. Dr. Brockman reports four thousand cases thus\\n      operated upon. Galezowski and others open the capsule with the knife after\\n      making the first corneal puncture. Suarez De Mendoza introduces a suture\\n      into the lips of the section; and J.S. Prout keeps the lids closed by\\n      means of a suture. These measures, however, have not received any general\\n      adoption.\\n      \\n Finally, careful must be given to the\\n      division of secondary cataracts. a capsulotomy should be performed as soon\\n      as practicable. If delayed too long, the capsule becomes tough and hard to\\n      cut. In the prescribing of glasses, Javal\\'s ophthalmometer has been of\\n      great service to me. If, more perfectly than any other instrument, shows\\n      the changes in the corneal curvature. This facilitates the work of finding\\n      the proper astigmatic glass which will give the highest visual result.\\n      \\n Secondary capsulotomy, when necessary,\\n      and the prescribing of glasses, are the final steps in the operation for\\n      giving sight a cataract patient. They are the finishing touches upon a\\n      piece of work that has been skilfully and delicately wrought, and without\\n      which all that has preceded may be of no avail.\\n      \\n DISCUSSION.\\n      \\n B.B. VIETZ, M.D.: Cocaine.-Of course\\n      all appreciate its worth. The strength of the solution to use, and the\\n      dangers of the drug are points that interest us and about which any\\n      discussion can be raised. For the first two years after cocaine came into\\n      use, I used a four-grain solution only in all operation about the eye.\\n      Enucleation was painlessly performed in two cases, iridectomy many times,\\n      etc., and I am not yet entirely convinced but that the effect of a weak\\n      solution, everything considered, is as satisfactory as when a stronger one\\n      is used. If then, a four- grain solution produces anaesthesia so\\n      completely, surely a two per cent. solution is plenty strong enough for\\n      the oculist.\\n      \\n Dangers of Cocaine were not mentioned\\n      by the essayist. But the note of alarm is frequently sounded in our\\n      journals, one surgeon discarding it entirely in threat work. The dangers,\\n      I think, are over-estimated, for I have never seen any toxic effects\\n      whatever, and have used a 10 per cent. solution in operations about the\\n      nose and throat.\\n      \\n Antisepsis.-Dr. Bissell states that\\n      \"cleanliness secured the maintained without the use of germicidal\\n      agents is the superior method.\" I am fully in accord with this\\n      declaration. I take issue with the Doctor. however, upon the method he\\n      suggests for preparing our instruments. I do not believe it is necessary\\n      to take so much trouble and precaution. He puts them, he says, first into\\n      boiling water an alcohol; then transfers them to a sterilizer, where for\\n      an hour they are sterilized together with all solutions to be used. I\\n      confess to being very unscientific when it comes to the matter of\\n      antisepsis.\\n      \\n In eye surgery my practice has been to\\n      wash my hands, wipe the instruments with absorbent cotton, have the\\n      patient\\'s face washed and check, lid and brow wiped with cotton. The\\n      cocaine solution I make myself in small quantities using always hydrant\\n      water. In eight years\\' private hospital and college clinic practice, I\\n      have yet to see suppuration in a single case of bad effects that could be\\n      traced, remotely even, to germinal influence. I do not wish to be\\n      understood as advocating carelessness. Reasonable precautions should be\\n      taken in every case; but this striving after perfect antisepsis is, to my\\n      mind, a useless waste of time and energy. Careless handling, bruising of\\n      parts during operations, has much to do with causing suppuration.\\n      \\n Surgical Interference in\\n      Heterophoria.-It is the consensus of opinion, I think, that high degrees\\n      of heterophoria, especially exophoria, can be cured by complete tenotomy,\\n      also that many cases of low degree get relief by systematic exercising of\\n      the muscles with prism. What to do with the medium grades is as yet, with\\n      me, an unsolved problem. I have nothing satisfactory to offer on the\\n      subject. Unfortunately, I have seen so many cases operated upon by others\\n      where the condition was actually made worse, or at best not benefited,\\n      that it has deterred me from experimenting to any extent.\\n      \\n Strabismus Operations.-The advancement\\n      of a muscle. In my library there are works on the eye by thirteen\\n      different authors. In describing this operation, all say substantially the\\n      same thing, only that some recommend two sutures, some three or more. But\\n      all claim that a diverging eye can be brought into position and held there\\n      by passing the sutures through the flap of conjunctiva only, at the margin\\n      of the cornea. Utter failure was the record of my efforts to advance a\\n      muscle in bad cases of divergence, until I learned how to make the\\n      operation. But not a hint is given in these thirteen books mentioned of\\n      the necessary proceedings to ensure success. And that is the method of Dr.\\n      Wray, mentioned in the paper. One end of the sutures must be secured to\\n      the stump of the tendon at its insertion into the sclerotic to relieve the\\n      strain upon the conjunctiva or the sutures will tear out. Ninety-five per\\n      cent. of the operation for advancement are made upon the internal rectus,\\n      and usually upon adults. The eye seems to have become almost fixed in this\\n      position, and considerable power must be exerted to bring it into place,\\n      much more in my experience than the thin delicate conjunctiva is capable\\n      of sustaining.\\n      \\n Immature Cataracts-Artificial ripening\\n      of the lens. My experience head me to declare against the procedure, from\\n      the fact that I have been unable to accomplish anything of the kind. The\\n      growth or formation of a senile cataract is a physiological progressive\\n      sclerosis. That of soft cataract regressive metamorphosis, different\\n      processes entirely. It is true that you may puncture the anterior capsule,\\n      perform iridectomy or institute any of the procedures mentioned in the\\n      paper and set up this regressive process, and any transparent portions of\\n      a lens in a very short time will become opaque. But this portion\\n      artificially ripened is no harder than before, no more easy to operate\\n      upon for removal. It is possible that this cortical, opaque, pasty mass\\n      might harden if left long enough, though I have waited a year and upon\\n      removal found no evidence of any hardening. I make no further attempt to\\n      artificially ripen a senile cataract.\\n      \\n DR. VILAS: In undertaking to discuss\\n      the paper of Dr. Bissell, I am embarrassed at the outset in that direction\\n      by a hearty concurrence in nearly all contained therein. Moreover, on so\\n      vast a subject, so well treated by the essayist, I can hope to shed no\\n      additional light, but perhaps may emphasize some of the points made. .\\n      \\n It seems to me that if I were asked to\\n      name the greatest aid to the ophthalmologist supplied during the time I\\n      have practiced ophthalmology, I should answer the present use of cocaine.\\n      It has altered the whole course of professional life of an oculist, while\\n      to those who ar constantly in the surgical arena it has proved invaluable.\\n      I shall not dwell on the reasons for this warm encomium, because its\\n      advantages have been well set forth by the essayist, in whose method of\\n      use I concur. It requires a little experience to get its best effects,\\n      however, even with the method given. Were I not confined to its surgical\\n      aspect, much more concerning its use might be said.\\n      \\n The attention which anti-and asepsis\\n      has attracted can only be for the nest interests of the profession, and\\n      yet I am of the opinion that reputation shave been made by many of the\\n      special procedures connected therewith, only to quickly pass away. In my\\n      judgment absolute cleanliness secured and maintained by the simplest\\n      methods, is the result to the sought after; and I cannot but believe that\\n      too much and too careful irrigating and drenching of the eye, internally\\n      and externally, is on the whole not only unnecessary, but often harmful.\\n      Too much care to the sterilization of instruments, lotions, and all\\n      adjuvants to an operation, and to the cleanliness of the patient and\\n      operator, can hardly be given, however; and it is oftener that the result\\n      is affected by neglect of this precaution than from apparently injurious\\n      pathological surroundings.\\n      \\n In my own practice I also prefer to\\n      combat the dangers which may arise from an immature lens in a cataract\\n      extraction, than to attempt to artificially ripen it; and yet, unless some\\n      excellent reason (one almost imperative) compels, I prefer to forego the\\n      operation rather than to tempt disaster by too boldly attacking a lens\\n      which seems not yet fully ready for successful delivery.\\n      \\n With the exception of the conclusions\\n      as to the results of operations fro heterophoria, which I consider too\\n      optimistic, I agree in the main with the balance of the paper-all of which\\n      is a valuable contribution to our proceedings.\\n      \\n DR. RANDALL: I have seen a little in\\n      some of the journals in regard to Phenic Acid obviating the systemic\\n      affection. I would like to know if any one has had any experience with\\n      that agent?.\\n      \\n HAROLD WILSON, M.D., of Detroit: I wish\\n      to mention an operation for convergent strabismus, which, although perhaps\\n      not altogether novel, has not to my knowledge been brought particularly to\\n      the knowledge of the profession. It is an operation which I have derived\\n      from my father, and from what source he obtained it I do not know, but I\\n      have used it for some time. It consists, briefly, in making two incisions\\n      through the conjunctiva, one parallel to the lower border, and one\\n      parallel to the upper border of the rectus muscle. The conjunctiva or the\\n      sub-conjunctival tissue is then dissected up with scissors back under the\\n      caruncle, and as far laterally as may be desired. The hook is then\\n      introduced under the muscle through one of these incisions, and the point\\n      brought out through the other. The muscle is then severed. If further\\n      correction is desired, lateral incisions into the capsule may be made. The\\n      advantages of he operation are the slight disfigurement and no (or very\\n      little) retraction of the caruncle.\\n      \\n F. PARKE LEWIS, M.D.: Just a word about\\n      the use of stronger cocaine in lowering the vision of the eye in the\\n      extraction of cataract, in four-grain solution, continued for ten or\\n      fifteen minutes. I believe that a certain amount of elasticity is\\n      necessary in the lens, and if, after using your cocaine ten minutes or\\n      more, you find all the elasticity is gone, and you have to squeeze the\\n      lens out, you very seriously imperil the result of the operation. I\\n      thoroughly agree in limiting the time for the use of cocaine in extracting\\n      the cataract. I very often use the cocaine two to four minutes; it is\\n      quite enough. During the last year I have several times made operations,\\n      in one instance with very peculiar results. The patient, an old man with\\n      the lens so far matured as to make reading impossible, and locomotion\\n      difficult; after having made an operation the patient was told to come\\n      back in three or four weeks and have the lens removed. Not doing so after\\n      two months, inquiry was made, and it was found the operation had cured the\\n      lens in such a degree as to make it possible for him to read. No operation\\n      was, of course, necessary; he could easily get around, and could read\\n      large print. It was rather a unique instance, and worth putting on record.\\n      In regard to the immediate capsulotomy, which Dr. Bissell has referred to:\\n      while I was not aware, at the time I first made it, that it had been made\\n      by others, I subsequently learned by conversation with Dr. Knapp, that the\\n      same operation had been made, and had been discontinued. The completing of\\n      an operation at one time is to me an important matter. The patient may\\n      come fifty, one hundred, or two hundred miles to have an extraction made.\\n      If you can finish the operation at the time the patient is convalescing,\\n      it is a very important thing, and it the does not necessitate any long\\n      operation. Moreover, the division of the capsule is in some instances\\n      followed by a general inflammatory condition. it is by no means a simple\\n      operation, or one devoid of danger. If, therefore, you can complete your\\n      operation at the time corneal incision is made and the lens removed\\n      without adding to the danger of your operation, you have added enormously\\n      to the value of your primary operation. Since the matter to which Dr.\\n      Bissell has referred, I have many times made this immediate capsulotomy,\\n      and have had no reason to regret it. I believe it to be in entirely safe\\n      operation. So long as we have the iris in proper position, we may open the\\n      posterior capsule allowing the vitreous to go into the anterior chamber\\n      with no serious results. When the support is taken off, then an element of\\n      danger is introduced. There has sometimes been a little loss of vitreous,\\n      a loss not sufficient to imperil the operation, but to make me feel like\\n      going no further.\\n      \\n A.B. NORTON, M.D.: I would like to add\\n      a suggestion as to what to do with those medium cases of exophoria. I want\\n      to reiterate the benefit, the improvement of leaving off your convex\\n      glasses in those cases of exophoria. I find, over and over again, cases\\n      where they have been wearing glasses, and have been treating for it. Leave\\n      off convex glass, and the exophoria soon disappears. In other cases, where\\n      they are not wearing those glasses, I think they should put on prisms. Let\\n      them have a prism to wear. Treat the muscles, strengthen the internal\\n      recti up to 70 degrees power, and if that does not correct the power, let\\n      them wear prisms, and later, in the higher degrees. If necessary, I am\\n      willing to operate. The operation which Dr. Wilson spoke of, for squint,\\n      seems to me to be like that of sub-conjunctivitis in the text-books. In\\n      regard to one of the Doctor\\'s questions about tannin, I will say that I do\\n      frequently use it, one to two hundred or five hundred. I use it very\\n      frequently drop it into the eye every hour or two hours, and believe the\\n      essential value of it is found very frequently.\\n      \\n DR. BISSELL., in closing the\\n      discussion, said: The question has been asked me regarding the special\\n      preparation of cocaine. I have had no special connection with it, and have\\n      not seen it used in our work. I do not think it is superior to any other\\n      anaesthetic agents that we have, and it is unpleasant to use, in soiling\\n      the clothing and staining, although it may be used. I think in one or two\\n      cases it has acted unfavorably, seemingly aggravating the case, and was\\n      probably used too strong; but I immediately discarded it and took\\n      something else.\\n      \\n Regarding the operation for strabismus\\n      spoken of by Dr. Wilson I should have given him the credit for it if I had\\n      known that it was peculiar to him. The first operation that I ever saw of\\n      the kind was not done by Dr. Wilson, and the only modification I make is a\\n      suture I put in, which has certainly given me wonderful results. In that\\n      respect it differs from Dr. Wilson\\'s if he is really the originator of it.', u'Tresorie - THE STUDY AND CORRECTION OF HETEROPHORIA [Study &\\nCorrection Of Heterophoria]\\n\\n HETEROPHORIA may be defined as that\\n      condition in which binocular vision, being temporarily suspended, the\\n      visual lines of the two eyes do not intersect at the point of fixation. It\\n      is characterized by a change in the innervation of the ocular muscles when\\n      the binocular fusion of images is prevented. Under normal conditions,\\n      binocular vision for a given point is, maintained by the co-ordinate\\n      action of the entire group of these muscles, and in the ideal eye, at\\n      least within certain limits, the innervation of these muscles is not a\\n      necessary function of the binocular act. That is to say, the binocular\\n      fusion of images being suspended, the innervation remains unaltered. It\\n      becomes a function of this act only in states of heterophoria.\\n      \\n Heterophoria is due essentially to a\\n      condition of faulty innervation, which depends upon one or more of the\\n      following factors:.\\n      \\n 1. The form and position of the\\n      eyeballs (orbits).\\n      \\n 2. The place of insertion of the ocular\\n      muscles.\\n      \\n 3. The essential and relative power of\\n      the ocular muscles (amplitude of convergence).\\n      \\n 4. The ratio of the positive and\\n      negative portions of the relative accommodation, together with the ratio\\n      of the convergence and accommodation for the point in question.\\n      \\n Under the first head it is clear that,\\n      assuming certain ratios of tension among the muscles of the eye as normal\\n      when fixing some point at a given distance from the eye, such as 1 m. for\\n      example, these ratios must vary with the length of the basal line of the\\n      eyes. For at this distance, with a basal line of 50 mm., the angle of\\n      convergence is 1.43 degree, while with a basal line of 75 mm. it is 2.15\\n      degree. In high degrees of myopia the alterations in the form of the\\n      eyeballs limit their mobility, and, consequently, modify the convergence\\n      tension of the muscles.\\n      \\n There is some variation in the place of\\n      insertion of the ocular muscles. Stilling has observed a wide variation in\\n      that of the superior oblique. We may assume as normal the following\\n      measurements, representing the distances of the insertion of the recti\\n      muscles from the cornea (Fuchs):.\\n      \\n mm.\\n      \\n Rectus internus, 5.5.\\n      \\n Rectus externus, 6.9.\\n      \\n Rectus inferior, 6.5.\\n      \\n Rectus superior, 7.7.\\n      \\n\\n      \\n In an eye where the muscular balance is\\n      ordinarily good, one or more muscles may become weakened by fatigue or\\n      disease, necessitating an increase in the amount of nervous stimulus to\\n      these muscles in order to preserve binocular vision. Under these\\n      circumstances, if binocular vision becomes abrogated, heterophoria is an\\n      easy and necessary consequence. Here we have true \"muscular\\n      insufficiency.\".\\n      \\n From the essential connection of\\n      accommodation and convergence, it is evident that the ratio of the\\n      positive and negative portions of the relative accommodation for any given\\n      point has an important bearing upon the muscular balance for that point.\\n      Indeed, if no other factor were operative to affect the muscular\\n      equilibrium, it seems reasonable to assume that it could be calculated\\n      from a knowledge of the relative accommodation. However, as a matter of\\n      fact other causes uniformly do exert an influence upon the position of the\\n      eyes, and moreover may be of such moment that their effects entirely\\n      negative that of the relative accommodation.\\n      \\n We see, then, that heterophoria may\\n      originate in a number of ways. From the variety of causes we may infer\\n      that there must a corresponding variation in the treatment of this\\n      disorder. We shall revert to this further on.\\n      \\n Methods of Examination.-In ascertaining\\n      the amount and character of the heterophoria present in a given case, the\\n      essential determination to be made is the position of the non- fixing or\\n      deviating eye. The common and most exact methods of making this\\n      determination are subjective. of objective methods, the only one that is\\n      practical is the old test of alternately covering and uncovering one eye\\n      with a screen. This is too crude to be of much value. Subjective methods\\n      depend upon the uniformity and congruity of retinal projection. The first\\n      instrument of precision for making the necessary measurements was\\n      Stevens\\'s phorometer. With this instrument, supposing the patient to be of\\n      ordinary intelligence, it is possible to measure deviations of the eyes in\\n      any plane with much accuracy. The substitution of a \"stopped\"\\n      convex lens of short focus for the vertical and horizontal prisms employed\\n      as to the character of the deviation could be made. The \"red\\n      test\" of Maddox marked another gain in the rapidity of the\\n      examination, and made it possible to measure the deviation of the\\n      non-fixing eye by means of scales drawn upon the wall of the\\n      examining-room. Burnett\\'s use of a strong convex cylinder was based upon\\n      the same principle. Another gain in convenience and precision was the\\n      introduction of the rotating prisms of Stevens, by which the separate\\n      displacing prisms were done away with. I have added another instrument to\\n      this number, a rough model of which I have the pleasure of exhibiting to\\n      this section. It consists essentially of a frame, holding upon its right\\n      side a cell containing two 6 degree prisms, with their bases in contact;\\n      or a Maddox rod, suitably mounted; and on the left a \"prism\\n      mobile\" of two 5 degree prisms, which, by suitable mechanism, may be\\n      rotated in the same or in opposite directions, and the amount of rotation\\n      measured upon a graduated circle so placed as to be easily seen by the\\n      observer. Behind the openings of this frame or slide are clips for holding\\n      various accessories, such as abducting or adducting prisms, a red glass,\\n      etc. With the double prism in proper position, and the \"prism\\n      mobile\" at 0 degree, set to give horizontal displacements, the\\n      patient looks at the point of light through both openings and sees three\\n      images of it. The middle image is seen by the left eye, and by turning the\\n      milled head of the \"prism mobile\" it may be displaced\\n      horizontally either to the right or left, from 0 degree to 10 degree. If,\\n      therefore, this image is not in a straight line with the other two, it may\\n      be quickly brought into this position, and the exophoria or esophoria read\\n      of at once upon the graduated circle at the patient\\'s left. To measure\\n      deviations in any other plane, the double prism is rotated into that\\n      plane, the \"prism mobile\" brought to zero, the small milled head\\n      in the face of the instrument pushed well up, and, the pinion of the\\n      recording disk being pulled out, the two prisms are rotated by means of\\n      this milled head in the same direction to the desired angle, when these\\n      adjustments, being reversed, the measurements are made in the same manner\\n      as at first. A little familiarity with the instrument will enable the\\n      observer to make these adjustments very rapidly. The Maddox rod may be\\n      substituted for the double prism if desired. To measure heterophoria\\n      greater than 10 degree, a supplementary prism may be inserted in the\\n      proper position in one of the rear clips, and its value added to the\\n      readings of the instrument.\\n      \\n To measure abduction and adduction, or\\n      in fact, muscular power in any direction, the double prism or rod is\\n      removed from the right-hand cell, and the \"prism mobile\" having\\n      been set in the desired position, the muscular powers can be easily found\\n      by rotation of the milled head at the left. In these determinations also,\\n      supplementary prisms may be inserted into the clips if necessary.\\n      \\n It will be seen that a considerable\\n      variety of measurements may be made by this instrument with rapidity and\\n      accuracy. Almost any object of fixation may be used, and at my distance\\n      from the eyes. The value of the double prism is, that it is easier to\\n      determine whether three points are in the same straight line than whether\\n      (as in Stevens\\'s phorometer) two points are in an exactly horizontal of\\n      vertical line, as the case may be. I believe that the credit of suggesting\\n      this use of the double prism is due to Savage, although the first model of\\n      this instrument was made long before his suggestion came under my\\n      observation.\\n      \\n So far as accuracy is concerned, there\\n      is a substantial agreement in the results obtained by the use of the\\n      Stevens phorometer the rod test, and the little instrument above\\n      described. Bissell has made a serious of comparisons of the rod and prism\\n      tests. In fifty-two cases of heterophoria, the findings of the rod test\\n      were greater than those of prism test in twenty- six, the difference\\n      ranging from 0.25 to prism dioptries, from which he concludes that the rod\\n      test is the more accurate. I do not believe that this accords with the\\n      experience of observers generally.\\n      \\n For the determination of\\n      \"insufficiencies of the oblique muscles,\" Savage employs the\\n      double prism before one eye, and a horizontal stripe at a distance of\\n      eleven inches, as a test object. If there is an insufficiency present, the\\n      middle line will run obliquely between the other two, the direction of the\\n      obliquely being dependent upon the particular muscle at fault.\\n      \\n Heterophoria may be measured in degrees\\n      of refracting angle, or of minimum deviation; in prism dioptries, in\\n      metre-angles, or in centigrades. The most common method is to use the\\n      refracting angle of the necessary prism. There is at present, no agreement\\n      among oculists as to the most desirable of the various reforms that have\\n      been suggested.\\n      \\n Symptoms.-In attempting to enumerate\\n      the symptoms of heterophoria, are we enter at once upon debatable ground.\\n      A wide difference of opinion prevails among physicians as to the symptoms\\n      which heterophoria is capable of setting up. On the one hand is a class of\\n      enthusiasts who claim for this disorder the power of exciting numerous,\\n      remote and performed alterations in the functions of the nervous system,\\n      extending its effects to include chorea, epilepsy and insanity. In support\\n      of this claim, clinical experience in these affections is set forth,\\n      showing that they have sometimes been relieved by proper treatment\\n      directed to the heterophoria alone. On the other hand there are those who\\n      deny these claims in toto and presumably upon scientific grounds. It is\\n      difficult to deny the evidence of one\\'s own experience, or that of other\\n      competent observers, but it is not always easy to interpret clinical\\n      facts. So far as concerns the cure of remote disturbances of the nervous\\n      system, such as epilepsy, for example, by the performance of graduated\\n      tenotomy, it must be borne in mind that in idiopathic epilepsy at least,\\n      patients have often recovered as an apparent result of a variety of\\n      surgical operations, such as trepanation without discoverable lesion of\\n      the brain our meanings; circumcision for phimosis; the excision of scar\\n      tissue; the removal of bullets, and many other diverse procedures. It is\\n      of the greatest importance to observe the fact that there is often a\\n      curative influence in a purely indifferent surgical operation. Thus we\\n      have recorded cases where, independent of the direct and proper results of\\n      the operation, abdominal tumors of considerable size have disappeared\\n      after a simple incision of the abdominal walls, and hip-disease has been\\n      cured, it is said, by removal of the fore-skin. Even without the\\n      hypothetical effects of trauma upon the nutrition, functional and organic\\n      diseases have not infrequently, I think, been cured simply by some radical\\n      change in the patient\\'s emotional state. My attention has just been called\\n      to a case of cataract reported as cured by \"Christian Science.\"\\n      From the accumulated evidence now at hand, I believe that hardly more can\\n      be affirmed than that these remote neuroses may in rare instance be among\\n      the symptoms of heterophoria, but that their claim to such a place has not\\n      yet been established beyond cavil.\\n      \\n Sequin has recently given a provisional\\n      statement of the symptoms of certain forms of eye-strain. According to\\n      this writer, paresis (insufficiency) of the third cerebral nerves and\\n      attached muscles (in which condition we may get exophoria or hyperphoria\\n      or both) is marked by certain rather definite symptoms, of which he\\n      regards occipito-cervical pain and distress as the most characteristic.\\n      \"The pain,\" he says, \"diurnal, as a rule, and often not\\n      appearing until the patient has used his eyes in dressing, eating or\\n      reading, is usually greatest between the occipital bone and the second\\n      vertebra, though if often extends from the upper part of the occiput to\\n      the fourth or even sixth vertebra. It is sometimes more a \\'distress\\' than\\n      a true pain, and is often accompanied by sensations of stiffness and\\n      tightness (\\'as if a hand grasped the neck\\'). There is never, strictly\\n      speaking, neuralgia of the occipital nerves, or objective rigidity, as in\\n      beginning caries. Tenderness is rarely found, though in women spinal\\n      hyperaesthesia (so-called spinal irritation) often coincides. Frequently\\n      there is a sensation of weight or downward pressure on the back part of\\n      the head, with (usually) intermittent numbness (a \\'dead\\' or \\'wooden\\'\\n      feeling) and formication. In some cases the fulness or rightness (cincture\\n      or cap feeling) extends to the whole head. Apparent loss of power of\\n      attention and concentration (volition) is much complained of, even to a\\n      degree simulating mental failure. Reading, writing sewing piano practice,\\n      conversation, even eating, are painful or unbearable; in other words, the\\n      symptoms are increased by any act requiring convergence and accommodation.\\n      The prolonged duration of these symptoms, or, rather, of the strain, may\\n      lead to neurasthenia, insomnia and a curious mixture of hysteria and\\n      hypochondria, so that the diagnosis becomes more obscure. Headache is not\\n      rare, but in such cases there are also faults in refraction or other\\n      factors. Simple asthenopia, sense of fatigue, or pain in the eyes, orbits,\\n      brow or temples, is only occasional, and seldom a prominent symptom.\\n      Usually the patient pretends to have strong eyes.\".\\n      \\n Payne has recorded a some what similar\\n      classification, referring the occipital headache to exophoria and\\n      hyperphoria. He adds the additional symptoms that these patients show\\n      marked inability to use their eyes at night, while their ordinary use in\\n      the daytime is comparatively easy. Frontal pain or headache is referred to\\n      excessive strain of convergence or accommodation, as in hyperopia and\\n      astigmatism.\\n      \\n The symptoms of esophoria are less\\n      clearly marked. Seguin notes, as associated with paresis of the\\n      \"sixth cerebral nerves,\" that a sense of confusion, or\\n      dizziness, not a true vertigo, is one of the most prominent symptoms. The\\n      use of the eyes for distant objects, walking in the streets, contract and\\n      business with other persons, attendance at church or in the theatre,\\n      sight-seeing, shopping and similar occupations may be productive of great\\n      distress to the patient, who feels better when quiet and alone.\\n      \"Various and peculiar sensations are felt in the head, such as a\\n      sense of fulness, \\'as if the head would burst;\\' a downward pressure on the\\n      head, diffused or localized, \\'as if a stone or sharp stick\\' pressed on it;\\n      a sense of constriction, general or cincture-like; pain in various areas\\n      of the scalp; occasional feelings of numbness )a \\'dead\\' or \\'wooden\\'\\n      feeling), or of formication or worm-like crawling, also variously\\n      distributed; a quasi-tinnitus, or noise in the head (not in the ears) is\\n      not rare.\" (Seguin.).\\n      \\n The symptoms of esophoria are not so\\n      characteristic as those of exophoria and hyperphoria, and will be seen to\\n      overlap them.\\n      \\n Insomnia and general nervous debility\\n      are said to be not uncommon results of continued eye-strain. In the\\n      eyeball itself there are reasons to believe that various forms of local\\n      inflammatory affections, such as conjunctival hyperaemia, blepharitis,\\n      ulcers, etc. (Stevens), may sometimes be indirectly dependent upon\\n      eye-strain. Stevens has called attention to certain facial expressions\\n      characteristic of the various forms of heterophoria. In esophoria, for\\n      example, the brows are compressed, with the inner end curving down toward\\n      the nose; lines upon the forehead low. In exophoria the brows are raised\\n      or arched; lines upon the forehead high. In hyperphoria the features are\\n      more irregular, and one eyebrow is compressed or drawn down, to correspond\\n      with the hyperphoria.\\n      \\n Treatment.-Here, again, we enter upon a\\n      subject where widely different opinions are held. In approaching the\\n      question of treatment we must not fail to bear in mind the various causes\\n      which may lie back of the heterophoria. I am convinced that an intelligent\\n      appreciation of the causation in a given case, where possible, will often\\n      lead to a more just treatment than could be given by any manner of\\n      routine. It is true that it is often impossible to ascertain the cause in\\n      a given case of heterophoria with any exactness, but even a reasonable\\n      inference is highly desirable. Thus, in a case of exophoria due to paresis\\n      of the internal recti from general debility or overwork, it would be\\n      manifestly improper to resort to tenotomy for its correction, while if it\\n      were due to the anatomical changes in the eyeball incident to a high-grade\\n      myopia, the surgical procedure might be eminently proper.\\n      \\n The treatment of heterophoria should\\n      begin with the determination of the following points:.\\n      \\n 1. The amount and character of the\\n      heterophoria; a, for infinity; b, for reading distance: i,e, 1/3 metre.\\n      \\n 2. The mobility of the eyeballs in\\n      various directions.\\n      \\n 3. The refraction.\\n      \\n 4. The muscular power; a, adduction; b,\\n      abduction; c, circumduction; d, amplitude of convergence.\\n      \\n 5. The relative accommodation; a, for\\n      infinity; b, for reading distance.\\n      \\n The practical value of these\\n      determinations evident. That of the relative accommodation will be\\n      necessary or at least useful, in certain cases only. The amplitude of\\n      convergence may be determined by means of Landolt\\'s ophthalmo-dynamometer,\\n      for its positive, and abducting prisms for its negative portion. The\\n      information which it supplies is largely contained in the determinations\\n      of the abduction and abduction. Thus if the negative convergence-abduction\\n      in a given case is markedly defective, tenotomy of the internal recti\\n      muscles for exophoria would be inadmissible.\\n      \\n Hyperphoria.-Stevens states that the\\n      treatment for hypendhoria is tenotomy. This statement is in accord with my\\n      own experience. In some cases, where there is an error of refraction\\n      requiring the constant use of glasses, a correcting prism may be\\n      incorporated with them, and give satisfactory relief. Or with emmetropic\\n      eyes, the prism may be mounted in spectacle frames and worn constantly.\\n      \\n It is questionable what internal\\n      remedies can do for the relief of hyperphoria. The late Geo. S. Norton,\\n      M.D., in 1889, called attention to the provings of Senega and Onosmodium,\\n      and their usefulness in affections of the ocular muscles, and reported a\\n      number of cases in which these drugs had been used with apparent benefit.\\n      The value of Senega in hyperphoria has been made the subject of a recent\\n      communication by Linnell, but as I have elsewhere endeavored to show,\\n      [Jour. O., O. and L., April. 1893.] the usefulness of the remedy in this\\n      disorder is by no means proven by the cases related. Indeed, the provings\\n      of Senega do not show any special adaptability of the drug to hyperphoria,\\n      so far as we understand the symptoms of this affection. Nevertheless, it\\n      might have an empirical or clinical value, but the evidence even here is\\n      defective. Norton says that the symptoms calling for Senega, are\\n      \"dull, tired, aching, pressing pains in the eyes, or throughout the\\n      whole head, with smarting and burning in the eyes, always worse after\\n      using them and often accompanied by catarrhal symptoms of the\\n      conjunctiva.\".\\n      \\n Onosmodium has many symptoms of\\n      heterophoria in its proving, e.g., occipital headache; a dull aching pain\\n      extending down the back of the neck, or over one side of the head,\\n      generally the left; vertigo, with strained or stiff sensation in the eyes,\\n      aggravated by use of the eyes for near work. Gelsemium has a transient\\n      vertical diplopia, and may be of value in those cases of hyperphoria\\n      accompanied with the paretic or other characteristic symptoms of the\\n      remedy. Stramonium shows a marked vertical diplopia in its provings. The\\n      importance of this symptom in the proving of a drug, is simply that it\\n      indicates that the drug has a direct influence upon these muscles which\\n      are concerned in the production of hyperphoria. We do not find diplopia\\n      (unless it be transitory) in heterophoria. But as a drug-symptom, diplopia\\n      is an indication that the remedy has an action along the line in which we\\n      seek for curative effects, and suggests that it may possess valuable\\n      therapeutic properties in the treatment of affections of the upward and\\n      downward turning muscles of the eyes. So far as the applicability of these\\n      or other drugs to the cure of hyperphoria, is concerned, the evidence in\\n      their favor, is at the best, obscured by the fact that in almost all of\\n      the cases reported, other treatment than the medicinal was given the\\n      patient, so that the action of the remedy is not clearly shown. Norton,\\n      himself, limits all attempts at a cure by remedies to hyperphoria of less\\n      than 2 degree. In higher degrees, an immediate tenotomy was advised.\\n      \\n Systematic exercise of the affected\\n      muscles by means prisms, has been used and recommended as a cure for\\n      hyperphoria, and the clinical evidence in our hands is favorable to its\\n      usefulness. In hyperphoria of 1 degree and perhaps 2 degree, if persisted\\n      in, it may effect a cure, but in higher degrees it does not seem to be of\\n      much value.\\n      \\n In a case where there is a manifest\\n      hyperphoria of say 1 degree, circumstance often suggest that there is an\\n      additional amount that is latent, and a correcting prism is prescribed, to\\n      be worn constantly, for the purpose of revealing this latent defect. Under\\n      these circumstance, in many instances, the daily examination will show an\\n      apparent increase in the hyperphoria, until we may have developed in the\\n      course of a week, beginning with 1 degree, as much as 5 degree or more.\\n      This final amount is then accepted as the total of the real hyperphoria\\n      present, and made the basis of an operative correction. Now while it may\\n      happen that latent hyperphoria can be made manifest in this way in some\\n      instances, we must not lose sight of the fact that under the constant\\n      influence of a prism, the normal equilibrium of the eyes will often be\\n      temporarily changed so as to generate a species of false heterophoria.\\n      Thus it is possible to produce at will exophoria or esophoria in the same\\n      eyes, by wearing prisms with the base in or out, as the case may be, and\\n      either right or left hyperphoria, as we please, in a similar manner. The\\n      heterophoria thus produced is of variable duration, but always temporary.\\n      It may not be possible always to distinguish between the factitious and\\n      the real defect. The increased relief of concomitant symptoms, by the\\n      corrected increase in the manifest heterophoria, if it occurs, or the\\n      greater permanency of the disordered equilibrium, might serve as\\n      distinguishing marks, but if we accepts as the true state of muscular\\n      equilibrium, that shown while the eyes are under the influence of prisms\\n      constantly worn, we are treading upon dangerous grated, and if it is taken\\n      as the guide to the extent of the operation, we are apt to afflict our\\n      patients with an over-correction.\\n      \\n With regard to the details of the\\n      operation itself, I have little to say, except that in tenotomy of the\\n      rectus superior, care must be taken to make the incision high enough, so\\n      that the tendon of the muscle will lie in the wound. Rather than to fail\\n      in this respect, the operator should measure the necessary eight mm. from\\n      the corneal margin with exactness. In my experience, complete section of\\n      the tendon is often required for the correction of even low degrees of\\n      hyperphoria. The lid retractor, held by an assistant is much more\\n      comfortable for the patient than the spring speculum. At the end of the\\n      operation, the correction should be as nearly perfect as possible. If an\\n      over- correction is made, an appropriate advancement is easily done.\\n      \\n Exophoria and Esophoria.-As in the\\n      treatment of hyperphoria, we have here a variety of methods to choose\\n      from; surgical, gymnastic, hygienic and medicinal. As indicated above, we\\n      are to be guided by the causes lying back of the particular troubles in\\n      question, so far as we are able to discover them. There is associated with\\n      most cases of disturbed muscular equilibrium a defective ratio of\\n      abduction and adduction, as well as positive deficiencies in muscular\\n      power. Thus in a typical case of exophoria, we may find that the adduction\\n      is abnormally low, or the abduction excessively high. In the exceptional\\n      and irregular cases this dose not obtain. We may have exophoria with an\\n      adduction of 40 degree or 50 degree. Or there may be exophoria in remote\\n      vision and esophoria for the near point; or the reverse may be true. Out\\n      of two hundred and twenty-nine cases of exophoria, Norton found ten with\\n      esophoria in accommodation; in one hundred and fifty-eight cases of\\n      esophoria there were sixty- eight with exophoria in accommodation. These\\n      atypical cases are credited to the disturbing influence of hyperphoria,\\n      and the recommendations made to correct this before undertaking the\\n      correction of the lateral disturbances. In some cases clinical experience\\n      seems to justify this assumption. Upon theoretical grounds however, there\\n      would not seem to be any satisfactory explanation of what we may call\\n      \"crossed heterophoria,\" in a faulty innervation of the superior\\n      or inferior recti muscles. It is true that there is a slightly increased\\n      tension of these muscles in the act of convergence, but this seem hardly\\n      enough to account for the abnormal conditions so frequently met with. As I\\n      have elsewhere suggested, a more rational and satisfactory explanation of\\n      \"crossed heterophoria\" may be found in the relations between\\n      accommodation and convergence. If we have a case of slight esophoria in\\n      remote vision, for example, it is easy to conceive that in convergence for\\n      the near point, exophoria might result from an enfeebled power of\\n      accommodation, by which the added stimulus of the accommodative act was\\n      not adequate to maintain the necessary convergence. This is easily shown\\n      in an experimental way, by observing the effect of convex and concave\\n      glasses upon the position of equilibrium of the eyes in fixation for the\\n      near point. If we have orthophoria, or a low degree of esophoria for\\n      distance, we can obtain exophoria at the near point, by decreasing the\\n      amount of accommodation in use for that point by means of convex glasses.\\n      Exophoria may be transformed into esophoria or into orthophoria in a like\\n      manner, by means of concave glasses. These experiments show very clearly\\n      the case with which \"crossed heterophoria\" may be explained\\n      independently of a real or hypothetical hyperphoria. They also suggest a\\n      possible method of treatment in some cases by such exercise of the\\n      accommodation as will increase its positive range. Clinical experience to\\n      justify this suggestion is wanting, as cases entirely appropriate to it\\n      have not come under my observation since the idea occurred to me. I am\\n      satisfied however, that the key to the explanation and treatment of a good\\n      many puzzling cases of heterophoria will be found in a study of the\\n      relations between relations between the accommodation and convergence, and\\n      in the relative amplitude of accommodation.\\n      \\n Tenotomy of the stronger muscle after\\n      the method of Stevens is a familiar method of treatment. The extent of the\\n      operation is determined by the amplitude of convergence. If we have\\n      exophoria with subnormal abduction for the far point, it will be improper\\n      to tenotomize the already weak muscles. In fact, it may be laid down as a\\n      general rule, that a tenotomy is indicated in exophoria only when there is\\n      an absolute or relatively excessive abduction. In the contradictory cases,\\n      the treatment must first be directed to increasing the power of the weak\\n      muscles, and of the accommodation, if necessary. If there is hyperphoria\\n      present, it may be relieved. The immediate effects desired by 1 degree or\\n      2 degree. It is highly important that the operation be made with the least\\n      possible disturbance of the tissues surrounding the muscle, so that there\\n      may be as little restriction of motion following it as is consistent with\\n      the correction of the heterophoria. The patient will commonly complain of\\n      diplopia in looking to the extreme limit of the field in the direction of\\n      the tenotomized muscle, and it may be many months, or even a year or two\\n      before this will disappear. If the operation has not been too extensive,\\n      normal mobility will be eventually recovered.\\n      \\n In many cases of lateral heterophoria,\\n      a tenotomy is unnecessary. The muscular balance, when but slightly\\n      deranged, will often be restored by the gymnastic use of prisms. This\\n      method of treatment will require numerous and frequent sittings. I prefer\\n      to add to the office treatments the gymnastic use of prisms by the patient\\n      several minutes daily, increasing the strength of the prism as the\\n      adduction or adduction becomes greater. This exercise with prisms is to be\\n      recommended in all cases where the convergence is abnormal, even though an\\n      operation be in view, and should be continued until as nearly a normal\\n      balance of power as possible is secured.\\n      \\n Therapeutics-The sphere of action of\\n      remedies in the treatment of heterophoria is not well defined. The reason\\n      for this, lies in the fact already alluded to, that specialists are\\n      usually unwilling to restrict themselves to internal medication, but must\\n      correct by mechanical or surgical, or by other accessory means, obvious\\n      defects in the eyes. Thus errors of refraction and accommodation must be\\n      corrected, and the use of systematic exercise and electricity are at least\\n      very common accompaniments of the indicated remedy. This compounding of\\n      remedial measures, together with the somewhat uncertain knowledge in our\\n      possession as to the natural history of eye strain, combine to increase\\n      the scepticism in the value of drugs, which the specialist seems naturally\\n      to possess. Speaking simply from my own experience, candor compels me to\\n      say that evidences of beneficial effects from medicine in heterophoria are\\n      very obscure. Still there are many men in our school who think otherwise,\\n      and this failure on my part may be a personal fault. Even among those who\\n      are the most sanguine in the use of remedies, however, it is fair to say\\n      that their employment is made to play a secondary part to the other\\n      methods we have considered. They are held to be useful adjuvants, rather\\n      that the principal factors in the cure, and are often resorted to, chiefly\\n      when other means have failed. It is far free my intention to disorders,\\n      and certainly when we are called upon to avail ourselves of their help, or\\n      law of therapeutics gives us the most satisfactory guide; yet it cannot be\\n      denied that surgical, mechanical and empirical local and constitutional\\n      methods are the stock-in-trade of the great majority of even those\\n      oculists \\'who call themselves \"homoeopaths\" If it were less so,\\n      perhaps it would be better, but we are called upon to face the facts as\\n      they are, not as we think they ought to be. If we have any better success\\n      in the practice of any branch of medicine than our Old-School colleagues,\\n      it is due directly or indirectly to our law of therapeutics. We cannot\\n      afford then, to indulge in too much scepticism as to the value of drugs.\\n      \\n Of the remedies likely to be of benefit\\n      in heterophoria, the following may be mentioned as among the most\\n      important: Onosmodium, Gels., Senega, Stram., Bry., Phos., Natr. mur.,\\n      Ruta., Calc. phos., Argent. nit.\\n      \\n DISCUSSION.\\n      \\n JOHN E. PAYNE, M.D.: This admirable\\n      paper has so covered the ground of our present knowledge of this subject\\n      as to leave but little opportunity for other than a statement of our\\n      individual experience in such cases. That heterophoria does exist there\\n      can be no doubt, but tests of positive demonstration have been so\\n      inadequate as to deter the cautious observer from the application of any\\n      remedy that can not be readily annulled should occasion demand. We will\\n      look forward with much expectancy to the workings of Dr. Wilson\\'s improved\\n      instrument, a description of which he has been so kind as to give us. All\\n      prism tests heretofore devised have had the disadvantage of being\\n      inaccurate when used over strong convex or concave lenses improperly\\n      centered. Rapid work is manifestly impossible under these conditions,\\n      especially when testing for small degrees of heterophoria. A strong\\n      cylinder lens decentered in the meridian of its greatest curvature may\\n      upset all our elaborate measurements, and lead us into errors of\\n      treatment.\\n      \\n We know that the persistent use of\\n      prisms has power to induce simulated heterophoria; why not therefore the\\n      same of strong convex or concave spherical or cylinder lenses improperly\\n      centered. As a preliminary therefore to all tests for heterophoria we must\\n      make accurate adjustments of all lenses correcting errors of refraction.\\n      Then as to times for making measurements; I have found that innervation of\\n      the recti is greater in early morning and in evening hours, the maximum of\\n      control being during the middle of the day. This I have been accustomed to\\n      ascribe to the temporary muscular inactivity that is an integral part of\\n      our existence after prolonged repose in sleep, in case of the morning\\n      hours, and to the fatigue that follows a day\\'s exertion, in the evening\\n      hours. I have found a difference of as much as four degrees in exophoria.\\n      Surely this must have an important bearing on our final diagnosis. Again,\\n      who can say from our present methods of examination that a case of\\n      heterophoria that presents itself to us is not quite as much due to a\\n      spasm of one of the recti muscles as to an insufficiency, or innervation,\\n      of its opponent? My experience would head me to suppose that such is the\\n      fact in some cases at least, if not in a majority. During my early study\\n      of heterophoria I had occasion to operate on several cases of exophoria,\\n      and to my surprise I found that a very careful tenotomy performed on one\\n      of these by the Stevens\\' method (without the use of strabismus hook, and\\n      making the conjunctival opening very small and exactly over the tendinous\\n      insertion) was followed by a swinging in of the eye to an over convergence\\n      of 16 degrees from an over-divergence of 10 degrees, and by a decided\\n      diplopia. The eye seemed literally to \"snap\" inwards, such force\\n      was used by the internus. This case presented, previous to the operation,\\n      a very limited adduction with an exaggerated abduction. I have since had\\n      the experience repeated. If the trouble had been due to an innervation of\\n      the internus, as, previous to the operation, I had supposed it to be,\\n      whence came its sudden accession of strength when freed from the restraint\\n      of its opponent? It seems more reasonable in ascribe the whole trouble to\\n      a tonic spasm of the externus, causing limited adduction and decided\\n      exophoria, than to place it in the usual category of weakened interni.\\n      These cases also suggest that our present methods of testing the actual\\n      strength of the muscles are misleading, and that a limited adduction or a\\n      limited abduction are merely such relatively, and not sufficiently\\n      positive in demonstration of individual strength as to allow us to apply\\n      such radical treatment as tenotomy.\\n      \\n Dr. Wilson has mentioned Dr. Seguin\\'s\\n      observation of a \" tinnitus, or noise in the head,\" accompanying\\n      esophoria due to \"paresis of the 6th cerebral nerves.\" I can\\n      bear testimony to a like experience, in two cases of exophoria. In these,\\n      the noise was described as a singing, like crickets or grasshoppers in a\\n      field, apparently located in the ears themselves, and coming on after\\n      prolonged use of the eyes. One patient said that he considered the advent\\n      of this symptom a warning to desist from the use of his eyes, which, if\\n      neglected, would result in a severe occipital headache the following day.\\n      An examination of his tympanic membranes disclosed a progressive subacute\\n      catarrh of the tympanic cavity and membrane, with some thickening of the\\n      latter, and a perceptible diminution of the acuteness of hearing. The\\n      other case was not examined with reference to this.\\n      \\n Regarding treatment, my experience has\\n      not as yet led me to place much reliance in the efficacy of internal\\n      medication, but rather to prefer mechanical methods, such as prisms and\\n      gymnastic exercise combined with general hygienic measures. The use of low\\n      degree of prisms (the 1 degree or the 2 degree before each eye) in\\n      exophoria and in esophoria, even in high degrees of aberration, combined\\n      with gymnastic exercise at intervals of two to three days, under personal\\n      observation and manipulation, has done more than anything else to secure a\\n      restoration of painless vision to the patient. Prisms of high degree do\\n      not accomplish more in such cases, and they eventually become an element\\n      of dependence that will, in the end, cause an exaggeration of the\\n      symptoms.\\n      \\n Permit me to call your attention to a\\n      Homoeopathic remedy that I do not find mentioned in Dr. Wilson\\'s list, but\\n      which I have found useful in cases of hyperopic astigmatism combined with\\n      various forms of heterophoria; I refer to Santonine. The special symptoms\\n      calling for its exhibition seem to be: A flickering before the eyes;\\n      objects seem to waver and dance; photophobia and lachrymation; all of\\n      which are induced by use of the eyes at close range. It seems to serve in\\n      those cases where Ruta is indicated, but with the additional symptom of\\n      \"unsteadiness of objects.\"\\n      \\n DR. LINNELL: I have listened to Dr.\\n      Wilson\\'s paper with very great interest. This matter of muscular errors is\\n      one which attracts a great deal of attention in the last few years, and is\\n      certainly of much importance. I have given the matter careful attention,\\n      and much has been written of the experience of others. I have had the\\n      satisfaction of curing several cases of Dr. Stevens\\'s and he has operated\\n      a number of times and left the patient in a worse condition than he was at\\n      first. It seems to me that the tendency to operate in these cases is\\n      sometimes too great. Surgery is more brilliant than the treatment by\\n      internal medication, and I think the tendency is to operate in many cases\\n      where a cure could be effected as well by other means. Moreover, it seems\\n      more scientific, if, by any means of treatment, or combination of\\n      treatment, we can produce two strong muscles, rather than by crippling one\\n      muscle to relieve two weaker ones. For that reason it has always been my\\n      end ever to treat these cases by remedies, by suitable exercise, leaving\\n      tenotomy as a last resort. Dr. Wilson, in his paper, makes the statement\\n      that we are too apt to trust our won experience, even if it is not\\n      supported by the experience of other people; and I wish here to simply\\n      reiterate and emphasize what I have said elsewhere in regard to the cure\\n      of heterophoria by means of internal medication in connection with\\n      exercise and electricity. I have treated a great many patients of this\\n      kind, and where patients have been willing to persevere for a length of\\n      time, I have seen only a few cases where I considered tenotomy advisable,\\n      and the results obtained, even with such operators as Dr. Wilson and Dr.\\n      Stevens, makes me still more conservative in this respect. In regard to\\n      trusting one\\'s own experience, it is a matter of positive conviction in my\\n      mind that certain remedies are helpful in these muscular troubles; and I\\n      especially think it true of Senega. I regard Senega as probably the most\\n      important remedy in the treatment of hyperphoria. I am in the habit of\\n      making careful examination, with various instruments of precision, and\\n      keeping an accurate, detailed account every day, watching the progress of\\n      results intelligently; and I know, from my own experience-from the records\\n      of my books-that hyperphoria can be cured by Senega alone, or by Senega in\\n      connection with other treatment; and it does seem to me that this very\\n      scientific practice is what we should aim to attain, and that surgical\\n      methods should be left to a secondary importance. Of course, I don\\'t mean\\n      to say that tenotomy is not the best treatment in some cases, but I don\\'t\\n      think it is the treatment for the large majority of cases.\\n      \\n DR. KING: It is not my desire to get\\n      between these two gentlemen in this pleasing argument. I agree with both\\n      of them in some points, and disagree with them in other points. With\\n      reference to the cure of hyperphoria in its various phases by remedies\\n      alone or in connection with systematic exercise and other remedies, such\\n      as electricity, etc., I must throw my experience in the balance with Dr.\\n      Linnell; that is, I feel satisfied that a number of cases of more or less\\n      hyperphoria-not high degrees though, however annoying-are decidedly\\n      relievable and curable by means of treatment outside of operation. I don\\'t\\n      believe that I can stand up and say that therapeutic treatment alone will\\n      cure those cases, because I haven\\'t given it enough attention. I have not\\n      had confidence enough, perhaps, to allow my patients to get along with the\\n      remedy alone, with anything like a degree of hyperphoria that was\\n      practically admissible; but I do use the remedies in connection with\\n      exercise and the prism and the currents of electricity also. I have used\\n      those methods of treatment alone without electricity, and I have used the\\n      treatment with the remedy in similar cases, and I have decided that the\\n      remedy assists most positively. I believe that in low degrees the remedy\\n      alone will perhaps in many cases relieve; but if the exercise and\\n      electricity and what not will hasten the cure, why not apply it? Dr.\\n      Wilson says it interferes with scientific decision. If we have certain\\n      cases in hospital practice outside of private practice, it may be well to\\n      make that experiment.\\n      \\n With reference to the application of\\n      remedies, I simply want to make a suggestion-something that I cannot say\\n      much as to its actual usefulness; that is, I cannot absolutely tell you\\n      that it is helping me much, but I believe it is and I think it is perhaps\\n      worth a trial. That is, the application of our remedies for muscular\\n      insufficiencies locally, directly to the eye, in the conjunctival sac.\\n      Gelsemium two or three times a day, applied externally, helps the patient\\n      decidedly. I have used the tincture of Nux vomica in exophoria, and\\n      tincture of Senega in the same manner. I have read, and have been told,\\n      that it is given in hyperphoria. I am speaking now of the empirical use of\\n      these drugs, for in many cases you must prescribe them empirically. I t\\n      has been suggested to me, in a general way, to use some of our other\\n      remedies, and I have taken these means, and I know that I have had some\\n      good results by the application locally of Gelsemium. Now, we know, if we\\n      instil a solution of Atropia into the eye, and prevent its passage through\\n      the caruncula, that we may give a great deal before we obtain\\n      constitutional symptoms. We can go further than that. We know that if we\\n      inject Atropine into the foot, ankle, knee, etc., we will soon have\\n      dilation of the pupil, and it seems to me that in the application of\\n      remedies to the eye, if we restrict the action of the remedy to the organ\\n      in which it is placed, we can push the remedy much further without\\n      obtaining physiological symptoms.\\n      \\n DR. STEWART: I would like to ask Dr.\\n      Wilson how the instrument here compares with the test made by the Stevens\\'\\n      instrument. I believe that may be recognized or called the standard or\\n      point of departure at the present time. There is an instrument of this\\n      kind made by Hardy & Co., of Chicago. Those of you who may be\\n      interested in this kind of instrument may be glad to know of this other\\n      one.\\n      \\n The question of internal remedies calls\\n      to my mind two cases, one of exophoria-a symptom of a ball running around\\n      in the base of the brain, and it gave the patient so much distress that he\\n      did not want any examination and would not put up with it. I, however, got\\n      an examination, and found a certain degree of deviation there, and then\\n      gave him Kali carb. Later, he came back, and the exophoria wasn\\'t so\\n      great. We can get these changes by the use of remedies, but what the drug\\n      has to do with it I don\\'t know. Another case: the patient came for an\\n      examination for refraction or muscular troubles, and I had given her\\n      Crocus, and got relief from that; that is, a diminution in the amount of\\n      her trouble, which was also an exophoria.\\n      \\n This brings to my mind Dr. Savage\\'s\\n      prisms, placed base to base. A year ago he left that subject in an\\n      unsatisfactory condition. He had demonstrated that he could tell with\\n      reasonable certainty which oblique muscle of either eye, the inferior or\\n      superior, was the weak one, but at that time he did not know any relief\\n      for it. However, that was in 1891. A year ago he read a paper before the\\n      American Medical Association, in which he says he can with prisms exercise\\n      these muscles by putting this prism before one eye with the axis vertical\\n      and looking at it in a horizontal line. We see the lines, and, on opening\\n      the other eye, we see third line, and if that third line is situated\\n      obliquely muscles. Of, course, it depends upon which eye is covered or\\n      which eye has the prism. Then, by putting that eye on the two- diopter\\n      cylinder (which is quite strong) and revolving it to make that eye open a\\n      little more, we are working that muscle which is at fault, and by then\\n      turning it up in the other line we can exercise the oblique muscles.\\n      \\n DR. CHAMBERLAIN: I am very much\\n      interested in this part of the subject, as I suppose I have had my share\\n      of experience in this kind of work, and I know that we do not yet fully\\n      understand all the causes that may be at work upon these muscles. We find\\n      so many reflex symptoms from other organs which may come under the same\\n      influence, especially in the oblique muscles. I have been much interested\\n      in this movement. We have a field yet that is somewhat unexplored. I have\\n      been using for the last year, nearly, Savage\\'s prism, and following\\n      somewhat his methods of relieving eye-strain; that is, I correct by\\n      correction of the hyperphoria or the exophoria. In my practice for the\\n      last three years I find so many cases that I have not been able to get\\n      relief after correcting the astigmatism and other refractive trouble, and\\n      looking up carefully the record of the oblique and recti muscles the\\n      patient would still complain of difficulty, and I have been at a loss to\\n      account for it, but I believe the trouble is with the oblique muscles. I\\n      think we will find, if we study their action carefully, that they are the\\n      muscles that govern the eyes, and when we come fully to understand their\\n      functions in every way and how to correct them when they are at fault,\\n      even as much as the other muscles, we shall make still more progress. I\\n      find that a certain class of cases, where there is oblique astigmatism,\\n      give me a great deal of trouble. I have very little trouble with the\\n      astigmatism if it is an angle of 180 degree or 190 degree; but when I get\\n      cases of oblique astigmatism, if I am not careful my patient will come\\n      back to me, and in that kind of cases we usually study the oblique\\n      muscles.\\n      \\n I have been looking up Savage\\'s ideas,\\n      and I find some of them pretty good, and think they would bear study. The\\n      oblique muscles will bear study, and we will reap reward and very great\\n      help in these difficult cases, especially along the line of oblique\\n      astigmatism.\\n      \\n DR. WILSON: I have not very much to\\n      say, Mr. Chairman, except this: we must be very careful, in my judgment,\\n      to distinguish between empirical and scientific therapeutics. If we do\\n      not, we are going to land in a very uncomfortable position from a\\n      physiological standpoint at least. Because we have found that certain\\n      remedies have been of service to us in the treatment of hyperphoria, we\\n      cannot claim that the application of that remedy to that condition is a\\n      scientific procedure.\\n      \\n In regard to the question that Dr.\\n      Stewart has asked as to the comparison for the results of this apparatus\\n      nd Dr. Stevens\\'s it is to has observed that it is precisely the same\\n      thing. The mobile principle is a mechanical principle for saving time and\\n      to insure accuracy. You can mark the prism at zero up to 10 degree and\\n      infinitesimal gradings. You don\\'t need to go from 1 degree to 2 degree,\\n      but you can go anything between those degrees with your instrument, as 1\\n      1/2 or 1 1/2 can be recorded, and it can be made fine enough to measure\\n      1/100 of a degree. I don\\'t know that there is any other point that has\\n      been raised that I have not touched.', u'Tresorie - THE EFFICACY OF THE VIBROMETER IN APPLYING VIBRATORY MASSAGE\\nIN AURAL DISEASES [Efficacy Of Vibrometer In Applying Vibratory Message In Aural\\nDisease]\\n\\n SINCE presenting my paper before the\\n      American Institute, in June of last year on \"Vibratory Motion as a\\n      Method of Massage in Aural Diseases,\" I have been using an instrument\\n      specially devised for that purpose called the \"vibrometer.\" This\\n      instrument is in shape like a banjo, and has four strings stretched across\\n      its length resting on a bridge, which sets upon a diaphragm. On each side,\\n      elevated above the diaphragm and supported by posts, are two horizontal\\n      bars, which support the mechanical appliances used for producing the\\n      various vibratory motions. This consists in what is called a yoke, in\\n      which revolves a shaft connected with the electro-motor by pulley-wheels\\n      and a belt. Behind the diaphragm is a shallow air-tight compartment,\\n      leading from which are rubber tubes that are inserted in the external\\n      auditory canal during treatment, consequently any vibratory motion of the\\n      diaphragm, which must necessarily be an inward and a corresponding outward\\n      movement, would be exactly reproduced upon the membrana tympani, as the\\n      confined air, not being able to escape, will undergo an alternate\\n      condensation and rarefication in the external auditory canal.\\n      \\n Every vibratory movement of the strings\\n      of the instrument is communicated to the diaphragm by means of the bridge\\n      upon which it rests. These strings by varying their tension and length can\\n      be regulated to give a high or low rate of vibration as desired, for\\n      instance, the heaviest string left at its original length adjusted to a\\n      slight tension may make about fifty vibratory motions to the second, while\\n      the highest string on the instrument adjusted to a high tension and\\n      clamped down to one-fourth its original length would probably make three\\n      thousand vibratory motions to the second.\\n      \\n In the centre of the diaphragm is an\\n      attachment which works on a lever, and when hit by the cam on the\\n      revolving shaft lifts the diaphragm to a considerable extent, causing a\\n      powerful effect on the membrana tympani. This attachment can be adjusted\\n      at four different leverages, which causes a modification or increase of\\n      its intensity and can be regulated at from one to twenty-five vibratory\\n      movements to the second. This is only used in very bad cases and for not\\n      more than five minutes continuously.\\n      \\n The instrument which I have been\\n      describing in an improvement on the first manufactured, and as far as I\\n      know, is the only one which offers the same facilities for applying this\\n      method of massage. The class of patients in my experience who are\\n      generally benefited from the first, are those in which the mucous membrane\\n      lining the tympanic cavity and Eustachian tubes is in a hypertrophic\\n      condition. The membrana tympani are depressed, opaque, and thickened. They\\n      usually complain of a stiffed sensation in the ears, with a great deal of\\n      tinnitus aurium, and that their hearing is worse during a cold. In cases\\n      where the mucous membranes are atrophied with a large external auditory\\n      canal perfectly dry and Eustachian tubes patulous, and generally very\\n      little tinnitus, this or no other treatment has done very much good in the\\n      majority of cases, and in looking ever my records I find that only about\\n      five per cent. have been relieved, while in the before-mentioned cases the\\n      good results reach at least seventy-five per cent. In treating persons, I\\n      always select the rate of vibration which corresponds in pitch, if\\n      possible, to that caused by the diseased condition of the ears. If there\\n      is no tinnitus to guide me, I find whether the patient can hear a high or\\n      low sound better; if it is a low sound, a high rate of vibration is used\\n      in treatment, and vice versa, A point which I would like to explain here\\n      is this: It is not necessary that the sound from the instrument should be\\n      of the same quality of the tinnitus experienced by the patient, but merely\\n      the same pitch. for instance, if a banjo, where one of the strings was\\n      adjusted when sounded to produce a certain note, and a musical instrument\\n      of any other kind, whose quality of tone was entirely different, was made\\n      to sound the same note in a room, the string on the banjo would vibrate in\\n      sympathy, which has been proven by experiment, any other note, no matter\\n      how loud, would have no effect. Another point is in the way the strings of\\n      the vibrometer are set in motion. On the revolving shaft is a wheel\\n      projecting from which are metallic picks which hit the string it is\\n      adjusted over. It does not make any difference in the number of vibratory\\n      motions per second, whether the string is hit fast or slow, but at the\\n      time the string is first hit the intensity is greater than it is just\\n      before being hit again, and as the motion of the wheel is perfectly\\n      rhythmic, revolving so many times to the second, it has just as good an\\n      effect as if the intensity during the fraction of a second did not vary at\\n      all. The idea of using vibratory motion, as I have said before, originated\\n      within my mind some years ago, and later put into practical operation, and\\n      as far as I know, was the first to lay before the profession in a\\n      scientific manner, this method of massage.\\n      \\n I have found that when two of the\\n      strings upon the vibrometer were regulated in such a way that when both\\n      were set in vibration at the same time, producing the sensation of a\\n      harmonious sound, the effect in some cases on the tinnitus was especially\\n      beneficial, relieving, where the various kinds of vibrations produced by a\\n      single string failed. Sub-acute cases of deafness, accompanied by tinnitus\\n      aurium, are quickly relieved, as the following case will illustrate:.\\n      \\n Mrs. M. Young, married lady, aet. 26,\\n      called at my office, April 1, 1893, complaining of partial deafness and\\n      tinnitus aurium. She had a stuffed sensation, or as if cotton had been\\n      packed in the external auditory canal. She says the tinnitus was so\\n      annoying as to prevent sleep. On examination, found considerable\\n      retraction of the membrana tympani, and hearing for the watch, on the\\n      right side five inches, on the left, seven inches. The Eustachian tube\\n      were partially closed, which made inflation somewhat difficult, giving\\n      slight relief. I used several of the vibrations on the different strings\\n      without immediate benefit.\\n      \\n April 4th.-She came again, and reported\\n      that no improvement had taken place. I again inflated her ears, after\\n      which she sat down to the vibrometer. The central attachment was used with\\n      considerable force continuously for four minutes, after which she declared\\n      that the tinnitus had entirely ceased in the right ear, and greatly\\n      modified in the left; the hearing for the watch had increased for both\\n      ears to fourteen inches, and the stuffed sensation had almost entirely\\n      disappeared. On inspection of the membrana tympani, found them\\n      comparatively very slightly retracted. On April 8th, found improvement had\\n      continued, when the same treatment was used for three minutes; after which\\n      she declared herself completely relieved of the tinnitus and stuffed\\n      sensation, with hearing powerfully restored. Saw her again on April 13th,\\n      when she declared the good results from last treatment to have still\\n      continued.\\n      \\n I find that in the majority of cases,\\n      when the strings of the instrument are used it is only necessary to strike\\n      them lightly with the friction wheel. In vibrating the heavy string, I\\n      generally set the bridge back behind the central attachment, and adjusting\\n      the motor in such way that the belt is at a considerable tension, so that\\n      the pulley-wheel revolves slowly. I also generally use this adjustment\\n      when setting in motion two strings at one time. The principle of this\\n      method of treatment embraces two essential features which to my mind makes\\n      this system of massage the only scientific one applicable to the membrana\\n      tympani and its associate sound-conducting parts. Message is the\\n      application of motion to disease, and its scientific administration\\n      consists of its application in a systematic manner. In applying massage in\\n      aural diseases, it is necessary to produce a to-and-fro movement of the\\n      membrana tympani, and, if possible, by a force which is harmless and at\\n      the same time effective. The vibrometer fulfils these conditions. Any of\\n      the strings on the instrument that may be set in motion by the\\n      friction-wheel, will produce a certain number of vibratory movements to\\n      the second of time, and the movements of the central attachment are also\\n      measured. What could be more systematic than this? The motions of the\\n      membrana tympani were intended by nature to its vibratory, and as the\\n      vibrometer generates measured motion, and these motions are vibratory,\\n      theoretically we have a scientific and effective method of massage in\\n      aural diseases; and, as demonstrated practically by the use of the\\n      vibrometer, we have in fact a great scientific advance over all previous\\n      methods. Since the introduction of this treatment in aural diseases, it\\n      makes possible a more or less benefit in cases of deafness heretofore\\n      considered hopeless, and has opened up the field for the treatment of\\n      aural diseases to such an extent that the number of deaf patients seeking\\n      relief at the aurist\\'s hands will at least double itself.\\n      \\n DISCUSSION.\\n      \\n H.C. HOUGHTON, M.D.: Dr. Garey\\'s\\n      admirable paper gives us the description of the vibrometer, an instrument\\n      devised under his personal direction and inspection, for the purpose of\\n      applying massage to the ear. It is the only instrument of the kind on the\\n      market, so far as I am aware, and after a somewhat prolonged use of it, I\\n      am prepared to recommend the latest production of the vibrometer company.\\n      \\n This instrument is a decided\\n      improvement over the instrument first sent out, and is capable of\\n      producing a most profound effect upon the drum-head and ossicula; indeed,\\n      upon the entire auditory apparatus. I am able to confirm Dr. Garey\\'s\\n      statement of the effect of high and low vibrations us regards treatment.\\n      \\n I have also been very much interested\\n      in the use of stringed or reed instruments for diagnosis, and find that we\\n      can detect any abnormal sensitiveness of the auditory nerve to high or low\\n      tones. Some patients are extremely sensitive to all tones, high or low;\\n      others to high tones and not to low tones; others, conversely. Again, in\\n      some instances, there is a peculiar sensitiveness to single tones or to\\n      discords produced by sounding the note and half-note at the same time.\\n      Under the action of the central attachment of the vibrometer this\\n      sensitiveness is modified, the sensitiveness to high tones disappearing\\n      and being replaced by a low tone or, conversely, under treatment, a low\\n      tone disappears and a high tone is established, temporarily, at least.\\n      Again, in cases of recent origin, treatment will substitute an undefined\\n      rushing sound for a definite musical tone, either high or low, and later,\\n      the treatment will abolish this, the patient being relieved of this\\n      intensely annoying symptom. In some cases, with this relief, there is an\\n      improvement in the audition; in other cases, no improvement follows.\\n      \\n I confess to the domination of the\\n      material over my mind in my earlier experience with massage, and I think\\n      the inclination of operators will be to use a far greater degree of power\\n      than is necessary. I therefore notice with great satisfaction Professor\\n      Garey\\'s remark that \"the object should be to produce a to-and-fro\\n      motion to the membrana tympani, and, if possible, by a force which is\\n      harmless and at the same time effective.\" I would hardly say\\n      \"to-and-fro motion of the drum-head,\" because I think that the\\n      expression is liable to perpetuate the motion which is fixed in the minds\\n      of most physiologists, that the drum-head moves as a whole, with a\\n      to-and-fro motion.\" That is true under the influence of the Politzer,\\n      Siegle\\'s otoscope and similar instruments; but it certainly does not so\\n      move in the ordinary function of audition, but stands as the iris does in\\n      the eye, as an adjustor, a regulator of sound-force; in some sense as the\\n      iris does in its relation with the lens, to adjust, regulate and direct\\n      the essential force, and the vibration of the drum-head is at every node;\\n      every portion receives impressions that are converted into molecular\\n      disturbances of varying lengths, according as they are produced upon the\\n      stiff and unyielding portions of the drum-head at the periphery, along the\\n      manubrium, or in the more attenuated and easily-yielding portions which\\n      the between these two areas. Not only so, but these impulses are\\n      communicated to the contained air of the tympanum, and make their\\n      impression upon the acoustic nerve through the round window synchronously\\n      with the impression made through the ossicula.\\n      \\n This whole subject widens before my\\n      mind in such a way that one might wish himself twenty years and at liberty\\n      to devote himself to a term of research in acoustics, such as is offered\\n      only in the technical schools of the continent of Europe.\\n      \\n WM. R. KING, M.D.: In discussing Dr.\\n      Garey\\'s paper I shall begin by saying that his methods have been closely\\n      followed by me since the beginning of his experiments, owing to the fact\\n      that I have been greatly interested in the treatment of deafness and\\n      tinnitus by means of sound waves or by aural massage since 1887, and have\\n      experimented and treated many cases by this method since then, though with\\n      crude and unsatisfactory instruments. Since using the vibrometer-which,\\n      after much study and experimentation, is now presented to the profession\\n      in practical shape-I have undoubtedly increased my percentage of good\\n      results.\\n      \\n I don\\'t believe I am over-sanguine or\\n      carried away by interest in this method, and believe I can rightly\\n      appreciate that this does not offer us a panacea or cure-all for auditory\\n      ailments, and hope I may always be ready to see the failures and to strive\\n      to find methods or remedies to reach some of them.\\n      \\n In speaking of the application of the\\n      instrument, I wish to call attention to the central attachment or post foe\\n      vibrations. Dr. Garey has not given it as much attention in the paper as\\n      it deserves. It is very useful as a general means of aural massage,\\n      rougher in nature and more general in application than the strings which\\n      help to make up the instrument. I often use it before applying the\\n      \"similar found\" to a given case, as a species of gymnastics, to\\n      stimulate secretion and motion in the conducting apparatus of the ear,\\n      viz., membrana tympani and ossicles. In most cases-in fact, in all-where\\n      tinnitus is present, I follow this up immediately by the nearest approach\\n      to the similar pitch obtainable.\\n      \\n I agree thoroughly with Dr. Garey, that\\n      the best results are achieved in cases accompanying hypertrophic catarrh,\\n      and that the least benefit is apparent in cases of atrophic nature.\\n      \\n Regarding the method of treatment in\\n      the absence of tinnitus, my experience the does not coincide with that of\\n      the author of the paper entirely; I do not feel that as yet we have any\\n      safe rule to guide us. My method has been to try the numerous sounds and\\n      variations the of until I find the one that seems to give the best\\n      immediate results, or that the patient himself will speak of as very\\n      penetrating and powerful )though not necessarily loud and heavy).\\n      \\n It seems almost impossible at present\\n      to simulate all the qualities of tone as they occur in the ears of those\\n      suffering with tinnitus; in fact, it would appear to be unnecessary.\\n      However, it seems advantageous and quite necessary to secure the closest\\n      simulation of pitch, thus in many cases soon obliterating annoying\\n      tinnitus and improving hearing powers.\\n      \\n The arrangement permitting of the\\n      picking of two strings simultaneously adds decidedly the usefulness of the\\n      instrument, as it increases the range of pitch as well as varying the\\n      quality of tones procurable, thereby decidedly enlarging our field of\\n      application.\\n      \\n The force used for creating the message\\n      or gymnastics of the membrana tympani and the ossicles-viz, vibratory\\n      force or sound- carefully and scientifically applied, is nature\\'s remedy,\\n      because it is adapted by nature, and is the only force which can rightly\\n      or safely be applied to these delicate portions of this complex organ of\\n      hearing.\\n      \\n A startling commentary on this subject\\n      is the array of cases benefited who have been relegated to the shelf by\\n      ancient and modern otology; cases declared unhelpable have been vastly\\n      improved. Pray, make no mistake; I did not say all cases.\\n      \\n It may be interesting to hear the\\n      latest regarding the instrument which was first invented for the\\n      application of this method of aural massage Mr. E.J. Godman, the inventor\\n      and patentee, is constantly on the lookout, and always striving for\\n      improvements to his machine. He has made many that you all know of. Permit\\n      me to report a few so recent they have not yet left the factory.\\n      \\n First.-The machine has been taken from\\n      its case, and is now mounted on a solid stand or table of oak, being set\\n      below the level, or so that the face of the instrument is just level with\\n      the face of the table. This is all supported by rigid, solid metal legs,\\n      which absolutely prevent foreign vibrations.\\n      \\n Second.-The motor has been removed from\\n      its little shelf and relegated below the table. I t can be placed upon a\\n      box on the floor, a shelf against the wall, or, better yet, a shelf\\n      solidly attached to the metal supports of the table. A belt goes up\\n      through an aperture to a wheel on a shaft, the other extremity of which\\n      carries a wheel with a rubber tire (a friction wheel), which in its\\n      revolution, being in contact with a larger flat- surfaced wheel on the\\n      main shaft of the instrument, turns this in harmony with itself. This\\n      arrangement does away with the necessity of shifting the motor each time\\n      you wish to shift the carriage from one string to another- a consummation\\n      to be devoutly thankful for. The removal of the motor from the instrument\\n      as at present attached will recommend itself to all who have used the\\n      vibrometer, a great amount of undesirable jar being thus avoided.\\n      \\n Third.-Ratchet keys capable of very\\n      fine adjustment of tension of strings are now provided for the instrument.\\n      \\n Fourth.-A rheostadt or resistance-coil\\n      is now to be placed beneath the table between the storage battery and the\\n      switch, by this means enabling us to control the speed and number of\\n      revolutions to a nicety.\\n      \\n Other, though comparatively minor,\\n      improvements are being made, and others are contemplated, as, for\\n      instance, the substitution of a roughly corrugated rubber band for the\\n      picker on the wheel, thereby getting rid of the metallic sound of the\\n      picker on the wire strings.\\n      \\n I have experimented with a number of\\n      appliance for the production of the sounds and pitches that I have\\n      required, but I always fall back on the vibrometer, especially as at\\n      present constructed, for satisfactory work and results.\\n      \\n This instrument may be, and probably\\n      is, as yet, in its infancy. It, and the method it applies, can only be\\n      perfected by constant work and experimentation both on the part of the\\n      profession and of the manufacturers. Each improvement we can suggest, if\\n      it only should serve as a means of helping one solitary case, would be\\n      well worth our while.\\n      \\n The experiments being made by different\\n      methods for treating deafness by sound waves is indicative of the interest\\n      the profession has taken in the matter. It is indicative of a lack of\\n      something in our usual armamentarium which is greatly longed for by\\n      patient and doctor; that is, the means for making the deaf hear and for\\n      relieving distressing tinnitus. There has been a dearth in this direction,\\n      and perhaps there still is, but I believe fully that we have in aural\\n      massage by vibratory force a decided acquisition at our hands.\\n      \\n E. H. LINNELL., M.D.: I would simply\\n      like to ask Dr. King how long he uses the instrument, and whether he uses\\n      it according to the deafness.\\n      \\n DR. KING: Yes, decidedly. In an intense\\n      case of deafness I would have to use it a great deal longer. The central\\n      attachment I never carry over three or five minutes, and the whole\\n      treatment I don\\'t think is over carried over twenty or twenty-five minutes\\n      in one case, and usually averages from ten to fifteen.\\n      \\n HAROLD WILSON, M.D.: I have only to\\n      suggest, what I have elsewhere called attention to, the possibility of\\n      another mechanical device for securing vibratory motion. It is well known\\n      that in the make and break of a current of electricity, in the circuit of\\n      which there is a telephone, we get an influence upon the make and break of\\n      the current in the telephone. Now, it is a simple matter with which these\\n      makes and breaks are made as to obtaining any number of vibration that you\\n      wish. You may, by a mechanical device of some rotary motion, if you\\n      choose, make and break the current as rapidly as you please until you have\\n      reached several thousand vibrations a second, or you may even make the\\n      vibrations so slow us to be easily counted. The application of this\\n      suggestion has been put in force in my own practice, more or less, in the\\n      use of the telephone as connected with the induction-coil ordinary\\n      battery. The more intense the current, the more intense the sound. You can\\n      easily see that it is mere question of mechanics to secure these two\\n      sounds-intensity of vibration and rapidity of vibration. I will say,\\n      furthermore, that it has this advantage. There is no noise in the office,\\n      which I think is not altogether true of the vibrometer. I would suggest\\n      that so far as the vibrometer is concerned, if it could be made to be\\n      noiseless to anybody but the patient, it would be a decided improvement.\\n      In that respect the telephone is a decided improvement, because there is\\n      no noise except to the patient, because the noise is right at the ear of\\n      the patient. If I were seeking for a perfected instrument in this line, I\\n      would go outside of the banjo idea. As we have the most perfect writing\\n      machines, which have no connection with the ordinary method of writing,\\n      and sewing machines, which have no connection with sewing by hand, so it\\n      occurs to me that possibly the securing of he vibratory motion upon the\\n      ears might be obtained in a totally different way from that which you get\\n      when you listen to the drum of the guitar or an ordinary musical\\n      instrument, and I would suggest that the make and break of a telephone\\n      open a very fruitful field for mechanical experimentation.\\n      \\n H.C. HOUGHTON, M.D.: In my study of\\n      this subject I made the acquaintance of Mr. Bernhardt, of New York City,\\n      who is a personal friend of Mr. Emil Berliner, the inventor of the Emil\\n      Berliner Telephone, which is the instrument by which the Bell Telephone\\n      Company maintain their monopoly at present. Mr. Berliner is the inventor\\n      of the graphophone, and has, I think, covered this whole matter which Dr.\\n      Wilson has mentioned. As ordinary Bell telephone receiver is put into the\\n      circuit of an ordinary induction machine, and you can use it just as the\\n      English people use the audiometer, and as you remove the coil you modify\\n      the vibrations, which is covered with another disk and a tube, and that\\n      tube covered with a stethoscope tube, which is the same as we use for the\\n      phonograph or vibrometer, and, as Dr. Wilson has suggested, you can modify\\n      the intensity, and of course the whole matter is adjusted by the\\n      attachment of the cord, so that you can have fine vibrations. The\\n      intensity of the vibrations is regulated by the distance to which you\\n      uncover the cord. The only difficulty in the adjustment is that it has\\n      been so severe that it is really uncomfortable, and the noise of the\\n      instrument is reduced to the minimum for office use.\\n      \\n A.B. NORTON, M.D.: I will also add that\\n      in regard to the objection Dr. Wilson makes to the noise, there is no\\n      doubt it is an annoying thing in the office, and in that line I have some\\n      men at work on my suggestion. We are devising another machine, or\\n      instrument, which is to be entirely enclosed in a cabinet, so there will\\n      be no noise whatever in the room if it is made a success. The idea is a\\n      little crude, and I am quite uncertain whether it will amount to anything\\n      or not. Then, in the line of what Dr. King was speaking in regard to Mr.\\n      Goodwin-he called, at New York, to see me last week. I made two little\\n      suggestion to him, which I think would be in line with his advancement.\\n      One is the number of the picks. The present vibrometer has four picks I\\n      suggest the experiment of trying twelve or sixteen picks, which will make\\n      a more continuous sound; it may be of some value. Then, in regard to\\n      regulating the speed of the machine: you regulate that now by a series of\\n      buttons, so as to get three different speeds. We will have a very slight,\\n      intermediate speed, and a very rapid speed. My experience with the\\n      vibrometer is especially favorable. I think the idea is in the right\\n      direction, and it is simply a matter of instrumentation.', u'Tresorie - THE HOMOEOPATHY OF AURAL THERAPEUTICS [Homoeopathy Of Aural\\nTheraps]\\n\\n IT is a cause for extreme regret and\\n      deep disappointment that the one man in our school peculiarly fitted, by\\n      his long training, his patient study and observation, and his extensive\\n      clinical experience, Professor Henry C. Houghton, should have been\\n      prevented by illness from the preparation of the paper on this subject\\n      which had been originally assigned to him.\\n      \\n As his assistant, working at his side\\n      and under his supervision for years at the New York Ophthalmic Hospital,\\n      the writer knows, better than most men, his eminent qualifications for the\\n      task, and of what the profession are deprived by his inability to\\n      undertake it.\\n      \\n The brief notice of a few days in which\\n      to prepare and complete an article on so important a subject, for so\\n      profound an occasion, is but simple justice to the writer to plead in part\\n      extenuation for the crude and incomplete remarks he presents for your\\n      consideration.\\n      \\n It is nearly nineteen centuries since\\n      the divine lips uttered the words, \"He that hath ears to hear, let\\n      him hear.\" Spoken to the scornful and unbelieving Jews as a warning,\\n      the words have an application directly physical, and in these days may be\\n      construed as a direct command; for the neglect to guard and care for the\\n      most valuable of all the special senses, with the modern facilities\\n      available, is reprehensible in the highest degree where one is responsible\\n      to one\\'s self alone; but the responsibility becomes criminal when the\\n      neglect entails upon a child all the disastrous consequences and mental\\n      suffering that follow impairment of hearing.\\n      \\n Considering the limitations\\n      necessitated by the brief time for preparation, no opportunity for\\n      research was available, and it is evident nothing new or starting can be\\n      presented. Therefore is seemed that the most practical, and in fact the\\n      only possible way to meet the occasion, was by a short statement of the\\n      means at our command for the treatment of morbid conditions of the aural\\n      apparatus, and the relations they should bear to each other.\\n      \\n The specialist, as a specialist, will\\n      find little of interest, because to him it is well-known ground.\\n      \\n The main point to which I wish to call\\n      attention is this: that there are no therapeutics (taken in the strict\\n      medical sense) which as yet are sufficient in themselves to meet the\\n      conditions daily presenting.\\n      \\n I do not say that drugs internally\\n      administered have no place, for they are of exceeding value; but this I do\\n      say, that he who, in his ardent faith in the all-powerful for-good nature\\n      of medicine, and his confidence in his own ability to always administer\\n      them accurately, neglects the necessary means of local treatment, will\\n      find, in dealing with the ear, that there are many conditions in which the\\n      most scientifically prescribed will fail to meet the expectation of\\n      himself and his patient; while some judicious local measure will give both\\n      satisfaction and relief.\\n      \\n Illustratively, our Materia Medica is\\n      full of symptoms pertaining to the head and eyes, and a case presents\\n      itself of which the perfect similimum is found.\\n      \\n The drug is given, with no relief.\\n      Again and again is medicine administered, with the most careful study of\\n      the totality of symptoms, and from the tincture to the highest\\n      attenuation. Ultimately an oculist is consulted, who finds a refractive\\n      error, prescribes the proper glasses-when, lo! all discomfort disappears;\\n      all pain is appeased.\\n      \\n Such instances are of too common\\n      occurrence to admit of argument.\\n      \\n As the result of the prolonged strain,\\n      certain morbid conditions may have arisen, characterized by certain\\n      symptoms, which persist after the adjustment of the glasses. For these the\\n      proper remedy may be applied with brilliant results. Here the Homoeopathic\\n      remedy finds its true field.\\n      \\n Analogous to this is the proper sphere\\n      of Homoeopathic aural therapeutics.\\n      \\n Time and again have patients presented\\n      themselves, complaining of deafness and tinnitus, having been drugged for\\n      weeks with the \"suitable Homoeopathic remedy,\" that have gone\\n      from the office in ten minutes with completely restored function, simply\\n      by the removal of a mass of cerumen from the meatus. It is true that the\\n      ceruminous accumulation may be due to a morbid condition of the glands,\\n      arising from some perverted state of the system. For this, medicinal\\n      treatment is applicable; but the patient applied for relief from his\\n      discomfort, and be obtained it by a simple local measure-while all the\\n      medicine in the pharmacies would not have helped him. Afterwards is the\\n      time for administering such suitable remedies as may reach the underlying\\n      cause that resulted in filling his ears with the impacted mass.\\n      \\n In the one case, remedies are suitable\\n      to relieve the consequences, the cause being removed by local means; in\\n      the other, the consequences are relieved by local measures, the cause\\n      being treated constitutionally.\\n      \\n I have cited these two conditions\\n      purely as illustrations, and my remarks may seem trivial to you, but I am\\n      led to make them of these reasons:.\\n      \\n Upon the issuance of a small work\\n      relating to the ear (in 1885), I used the following words in the preface:\\n      \"In regard to treatment, I am firmly convinced that we are not yet in\\n      a position to dispense with local measures; our therapeutics are yet too\\n      meagre in this department.\".\\n      \\n Certain critics assailed the statement\\n      as evidencing a lack of faith in the curative powers of Homoeopathy.\\n      \\n Another reason is, the fact that\\n      Homoeopathy suffers from the indiscreet fanaticism and ignorance of a\\n      class, of whom the aforesaid critics are a portion. This class, claiming\\n      that the Homoeopathic law of cure is sufficient for every morbid condition\\n      of the system, pursue with malignity and invective all who do not\\n      subscribe to the same views, calling them mongrels, hypocrites, false to\\n      the master\\'s teachings, etc. These are they who are responsible for much\\n      of the ridicule which Homoeopathy has been compelled to endure in spite of\\n      its onward march.\\n      \\n In 1876, at Philadelphia, Professor\\n      T.P. Wilson, on a similar subject said: \"This point needs emphasis,\\n      became, we as a school have unfortunately been always handicapped by a\\n      class of professed leaders who have boastfully discarded these things, and\\n      taught us to rely upon symptomatology.\".\\n      \\n This ignorance and boastful assertion\\n      exists to-day, and it is in an effort to clear the ground, that the true\\n      place and value of our remedies in aural work may be seen that the\\n      foregoing remarks have been indulged in.\\n      \\n Coming, then, strictly to the matter in\\n      hand, we find ourselves in possession of two classes of resources for\\n      reaching and relieving the conditions that present themselves, general and\\n      specific. The general means includes all local measures, nutrition,\\n      hygiene, sanitation, etc.; the specific, our remedies.\\n      \\n Taking first, one of the most common\\n      affection, an earache, an acute aural catarrh, the otitis media\\n      catarrhalis acuta of the specialist, what can be done for it?.\\n      \\n Certainly, few conditions give rise to\\n      more intense pain, and in a certain class, with marked predispositions,\\n      repeated attacks lay the foundation for obstinate and intractable\\n      consequences. The local measures at command are protection, heat\\n      instillations, inflation, blood-letting, and paracentesis.\\n      \\n These are common property, and in any\\n      given case we resort to more or less them.\\n      \\n Now, in the matter of medicine, have we\\n      any advantage over our confreres of the Old School? Dr. Roosa says:\\n      \"The proper treatment of acute aural catarrh is, predominantly, an\\n      antiphlogistic one. The disease is an inflammation of the severest form,\\n      and can only be successfully combated by such means as blood-letting and\\n      Opium.\" Dr. Burnett says: \"Anodynes should be given in doses\\n      sufficient to allay pain and produce sleep. Aconite....is of great value\\n      in acute otitis.\\n      \\n Many quotations from different\\n      authorities could be adduced to the same purport, but the consensus of\\n      most of them is the same, viz., reduce the inflammation by local measures,\\n      and allay the pain by anodynes.\\n      \\n To this uniform paucity of medicinal\\n      resources of the Old- School specialists, there is one notable exception.\\n      Dr. Sexton, in speaking of the treatment of acute otitis media, recommends\\n      quite an array of Homoeopathic remedies-Acon., Hepar., Merc., Puls.,\\n      etc.,-but then, he is half a Homoeopath anyhow.\\n      \\n Let us look, now, at our side of the\\n      case. We find an acute local inflammation, with constitutional\\n      disturbances, fever, frequently sore throat, etc. Can you not readily\\n      picture to yourselves the Aconite type, with its flushed face, high\\n      temperature, bounding pulse, restless impatience, anxious tossing, pains\\n      sharp and tearing, extreme sensitiveness to noise, and all the\\n      concomitants that make up an Aconite case. So take your list of remedies,\\n      and in your imagination you can see the Belladonna case, the Ferrum phos.,\\n      the Mercurius the Hepar. sulph., the Pulsatilla, and so on down the line.\\n      \\n I am not going into the details of\\n      symptomatology, but merely direct your attention to the contrast between\\n      the poverty of their resources, and the richness of our own if but used\\n      wisely and intelligently.\\n      \\n Supposing the morbid condition has\\n      passed beyond the line of the so-called catarrhal from and has eventuated\\n      in suppuration.\\n      \\n In many cases, as you well know, this\\n      point seems to mark the climax of the inflammatory action, and resolution\\n      follows.\\n      \\n But this by no means ends the\\n      difficulty in some instances, even where the membrane becomes repaired.\\n      Products of inflammation remain in the tympanum to organize and interfere\\n      with the delicate machinery therein.\\n      \\n You as specialists know the importance\\n      of the speculum and the air-bag, in preventing the development of\\n      adhesions and closure of the tube. But you have important aids in your\\n      remedies to assist in carrying on the process of resolution by absorption\\n      of the remains, and reduction of the swelling and infiltration. Our\\n      friends again here show their poverty, unless they trespass upon our\\n      bounty. Kali mur., Merc., Puls., the Calcareas, Hepar, Silica, all stand\\n      ready with a helping hand.\\n      \\n But in case resolution does not follow\\n      after the suppurative stage is reached and a chronic pyogenic condition is\\n      established you are confronted with a serious problem.\\n      \\n Now as a rule it is useless n aural\\n      suppuration to depend on internal medication alone, although there are\\n      perhaps few conditions more indicative of a perverted systemic state, and\\n      showing more need for constitutional treatment. The local conditions must\\n      be complied with, and unless this is done, your remedies are of little\\n      value.\\n      \\n But after cleaning and dressing the\\n      suppurative tract, such remedies as Aurum, Hepar, Mercurius, Silicia,\\n      Calcarea, Sulphur, Arsenicum, Lycopodium, come in as powerful levers to so\\n      modify the constitutional state that the local measures employed have far\\n      greater efficacy, and vice versa the local treatment being judiciously\\n      used, the medicinal treatment finds fewer obstacles in its way.\\n      \\n A block between two pieces of gearing,\\n      disarranges the machinery and limitless fuel and steam does not produce\\n      smooth running, but put the local conditions of the machinery in proper\\n      order and the motive power does its work.\\n      \\n It is this mutual dependence between\\n      local and systemic treatment that I wish to especially emphasize, and thus\\n      assign to our specific therapeutics their proper field of action. This\\n      argument holds good through all the varied forms of aural pathology that\\n      we meet.\\n      \\n Perhaps the most intractable form of\\n      treatment catarrhal condition. Taking the most advanced form of treatment\\n      of the present day, the air-bag, pneumatic speculum, vibrometer,\\n      telephonic attachment, surgery of the ossicles, naso-pharyngeal treatment,\\n      etc., one is simply removing the blocks in the machinery, and the more\\n      perfectly that is done, the clearer is the way for the more satisfactory\\n      action of constitutional remedies.\\n      \\n The ideas are not applicable to aural\\n      therapeutics only. Throughout the whole range of human pathology the same\\n      principle applies, and intelligent practitioners everywhere are\\n      recognizing the fact that there is more in treating human ailments, than\\n      the suitably selected Homoeopathic remedy.\\n      \\n Nutrition, climatic conditions,\\n      sanitation, hygiene, general and local, the elimination of mechanical\\n      obstacles by mechanical means, are indispensable to the best action of the\\n      remedy, and the more quickly this general fact is appreciated by us as a\\n      school, and the internecine warfare-as to the size of the dose, the degree\\n      of attenuation, who are true and who are false Homoeopaths-ceases, the\\n      sooner will be ushered in that wished for day, when the law of similia\\n      assigned to its proper relations and limitations, will be recognized by\\n      the world at large, as offering to suffering humanity its best medicinal\\n      aid.\\n      \\n DISCUSSION.\\n      \\n HAYES C. FRENCH, M.D: In the discussion\\n      of Dr. Sterling\\'s admirable paper we are not unmindful of the paucity of\\n      remedies that have been found, even by our Homoeopathic brethren to have\\n      any definite or constant affinity for the tissues involved in painful and\\n      destructive aural troubles.\\n      \\n Under the classification of general and\\n      specific agencies for meeting ear diseases Dr. Sterling says: \"They\\n      general means include all local measures, nutrition, hygiene, sanitation,\\n      etc.; the specifics, our remedies.\" To my mind this classification\\n      seems indefinite and unphilosophical. I doubt if many disciples of\\n      Hahnemann will be found willing to admit that our remedies are specific in\\n      the sense herein implied, from the fact, that the symptomatology that\\n      leads to the selection of an efficient remedy for the ear, may be found to\\n      have no definite relation to the condition of the organ at the time, but\\n      to quite remote ones. In selecting an ear remedy upon its clinical\\n      reputation the results seldom justify the appellation of\\n      \"specific,\" and if we chose it in response to the totality of\\n      the symptoms, whatever may be the result, it could not in harmony with the\\n      philosophy of our law of cure be said to be specific to the ear trouble.\\n      Again, in acute suppurative otitis, with incarcerated pus in the middle\\n      ear, what could be more specific than the relief obtained by the incisive\\n      offices of a lancet? And this certainly does not belong to the\\n      classification-\"our remedies.\" In all curative ear troubles, due\\n      to mechanical causes, experience has taught most of us that the more\\n      specific results have usually been obtained by means of mechanical or\\n      surgical agencies, and in the domain of prophylaxis the same has been\\n      true, as in the example of impacted cerumen cited by the author in his\\n      paper. Even in the few remedies for which our Old-School colleagues claim\\n      the virtue of specifics, our use of the same agents in accordance with the\\n      law of similars has always shown the falsity of the claim and the narrow\\n      limitations of the specific action, as for example the demonstration that\\n      the action of quinine is after all limited in its antiperiodic efficacy to\\n      definite forms of tertian intermittents.\\n      \\n Would that there might be some solid\\n      ground on which to found our claims to specific remedies for the painful\\n      and often intractable diseases, especially of the middle ear and the\\n      labyrinth. It is astonishing what specific results sometimes attend the\\n      exercise of a little good \"horse sense,\" even against the\\n      general teachings of the books and the professors. In one of our first\\n      cases of suppurative otitis media, after cleansing the meatus thoroughly\\n      twice a day for two weeks, following the dressing with pledgets of\\n      absorbent cotton in he outlet, with no appreciable diminution of the\\n      discharge, the mother of the patient blandly suggested that the ear might\\n      do better if stooping the canal with cotton were discontinued; and as soon\\n      as it could be done without sacrificing the dignity of the doctor, the\\n      advice was acted upon to the great benefit of the patient and subsequent\\n      advantage to the doctor-loose bandages, allowing free vent to the pus,\\n      being substituted.', u'Tresorie - AURAL THERAPEUTICS [Aural Theraps]\\n\\n WHAT Dr. Sterling has written in his\\n      admirable paper is correct. The lesson cannot be enforced too strongly. It\\n      will be needed as long as our colleagues prescribe potencies, low or high,\\n      to meet simple, mechanical conditions. As the devout Moslem, who said he\\n      would turn his camel loose and trust God,\" was rebuked by his\\n      Master\\'s reply, \"tie the camel and trust God, so we must use every\\n      means that modern science has brought to our hands, and then add that\\n      greatest vito-chemical factor, the Homoeopathic remedy. Still the question\\n      in my mind is whether the greater danger lies in the direction of Dr.\\n      Sterling\\'s lesson. I am inclined to believe that it lies in the direction\\n      of neglect of the vito-chemical for the mechanical. I question, if to day,\\n      we make as many constitutional cures as we did twenty-five years ago. Just\\n      at that time my effort and that of my colleagues was to test thoroughly\\n      the existing Homoeopathic claim made in our literature for the cure of\\n      special diseases-the eye and the ear- the clinic of the New York\\n      Ophthalmic Hospital having just then been put in our hands, and while I\\n      would not, for a moment, disparage there has been a retrograde movement\\n      during, perhaps, the last ten years.\\n      \\n The question may be asked by my\\n      hearers, \"what do you mean by constitutional cures; are not\\n      \\'Old-School\\' cures constitutional?\" Yes, certainly. \"Are they\\n      not good, satisfactory?\" Yes, certainly. \"Are ours better? No,\\n      not if they lack the vito-chemical element -the similar. The danger is\\n      that we are tempted to abandon the constitutional for the more tangible,\\n      because material, surgical, just times, weary along right lines, from\\n      ignorance, discouraged, we have deviated, tinkered, until with the use of\\n      some individual remedy the difficulties have dissolved as by a charm.\\n      \\n Easy to practice Homoeopathy? Absurd!\\n      One needs all the wisdom of Humphrey, Dunham and Allen, joined with the\\n      intuition of a Grey and the stolidity of a Liebold. The charm that won me\\n      to the practice of our art in similars, was the physiological indications.\\n      Every salt, every metal that lies in the mould of the earth, every plant\\n      that has appropriated the salts of earth and made them living vegetable\\n      tissue; every virus that healthy action of lower animals has made a means\\n      of defence; every virus that abnormal action of higher animals has made a\\n      besom of destruction, has an action that is unique at once so wonderful\\n      for simple study, that it absorbs one, if only on that line, but so much\\n      more wonderful if we study those possibilities which lie open before us as\\n      we turn to the higher plane of helpfulness for cure of human ills.\\n      \\n Enthusiastic? Of course, we are.\\n      Sectarian? Certainly, in the same sense than an enthusiastic geologist,\\n      botanist, chemist, may be considered an enthusiastic sectarian; only such\\n      are we. What have we to offer to the world that is superior to the\\n      mechanical or the constitutional on the old plan? Much every way. Among\\n      these metals, salts, plants, etc., that we use largely, some which act not\\n      only generally, constitutionally, but by the grace of an all-wise Jehovah,\\n      there are some which act as by flat upon the ears. Not only so, but upon\\n      special parts of the ears, special function being thereby conserved;\\n      hence, I find ground not only for faith as a medical man, but faith as a\\n      Christian when I learned that this world is it a thing or chance.\\n      \\n Let me, then, to enforce my claim, cite\\n      a few instances of this special, and if I may be allowed to coin the\\n      expression, elective chemico-vital action.\\n      \\n Take the remedy Plantago: what is there\\n      about this simple, unobtrusive remedy that would lead one to expect such\\n      special action as was demonstrated in the proving made by Francis\\n      Humphrey, M.D. This action is unique on the trifacial nerve and related\\n      ganglia. The pains are lightning-like twinges, and patients who have had\\n      suppurative inflammation of the middle ear, become alarmed at the prospect\\n      of a similar experience. The inspection of the drumhead, however, shows it\\n      to be absolutely free from hyperaemia. The relation to the dental branches\\n      of the trifacial is very interesting, the proving involving not only the\\n      ear, but the teeth, both upper and lower maxillary. From the clinical note\\n      by the prover, I quote: \"I have for many years used the Plantago\\n      sufficiently in various forms of odontalgia, and doubt not this use of the\\n      Plantago has been confirmed by all who took part in the proving during\\n      these intervening years\" (Humphreys).\\n      \\n A unique case may be briefly quoted:\\n      Miss S. came to me after suffering for a number of days with intense\\n      earache. Her brother, a physician, feared that she was on the verge of\\n      suppurative inflammation. Inspection of the drum-head showed that it was\\n      free from any evidences of congestion, and the hearing was normal. I asked\\n      as to her care of the teeth, saying that, in all probability, the trouble\\n      was due to defective teeth. I was laughed at for my opinion, because the\\n      lady had only a few days before had the teeth put in perfect order. I then\\n      thought that possibly the dentist might have packed the crown of the teeth\\n      too closely and produced pressure. On inspecting the recent work, I\\n      noticed two fillings in the lower molar teeth on the left side showed\\n      evidence of contact, and asked her to bite on the handle of a\\n      cotton-carrier placed between those two fillings. The result was an\\n      increase of the neuralgia in the ear, and the laugh was then transferred\\n      to the other side of the house. The whole difficulty was obviated by\\n      burring down the fillings.\\n      \\n The Plantago is an admirable local\\n      application, either to the ear or to the crowns of carious teeth that\\n      cause reflex neuralgia. Dr. M., one of my friends of the opposite school,\\n      was nearly converted to the study and practice of our faith by the\\n      application of the fluid extract to his own ear while suffering from an\\n      otitis that involved the canal as well as middle ear. The relief was\\n      magical, after various mitigating agents, such as the Magendie solution,\\n      had been used.\\n      \\n An interesting comparison may be made\\n      between Plantago, Chamomilla and Pulsatilla. The cases of intense\\n      neuralgia under the two former remedies are associated with slight\\n      hyperaemia, even if they do not pass on to acute inflammation; and the\\n      peculiarities of the Chamomilla symptoms, the intense intolerance of pain,\\n      and the irritability of the patient, are in decided contrast to the\\n      lachrymose and despairing depression of the Pulsatilla patient.\\n      \\n Capsicum.-Although I have frequently\\n      referred to this remedy in other similar papers, it is too good a sample\\n      of our work to be omitted from this. How shall we account for the action\\n      of Capsicum in mastoid disease? Sinapisms are as old as the art of\\n      healing, Possibly one of hippocrates\\'s numerous students had the earache.\\n      Mustard being scarce and red pepper plenty, a diversion was created in the\\n      race, so that future generation had in impression on the Capsicum line,\\n      and the proving evolved this tendency. But, seriously, one would never\\n      expect this symptom, \"on the petrous bone behind the auricle a\\n      swelling, hard, red, and painful to the touch.\" Yet, this was the\\n      guiding-star, under clinical study, to a most valuable remedy. We are\\n      under obligation to Professor Allen for a study that leads to the\\n      question: \"Is Capsicum of value in the treatment of ear\\n      diseases?\" In comparing it with Hepar and Mercury, it belongs to the\\n      earlier stages of acute catarrhal or suppurative inflammation, and\\n      undoubtedly saves patients form the deep-seated suppuration in which Hepar\\n      and Mercury are needed, and operative interference a possible outcome.\\n      Still, it is very difficult to draw that line, and it is effective even\\n      after profuse suppuration is well established, and has made the knife\\n      unnecessary. Compared with Hepar, the area of sensitiveness is very much\\n      greater, and there is less of the variations due to exposure, time of day,\\n      etc. Compared with Mercury, the area of sensitiveness is as great,\\n      perhaps, but we do not notice the peculiar nightly aggravations of the\\n      latter remedy, nor the sticky, uncomfortable perspiration.\\n      \\n Tellurium.-Why should a metal like this\\n      select the tympanum as its point of offensive warfare? Why should it\\n      produce in offensive that smells to heaven?-an odor of fish-brine so\\n      offensive that one finds a parallel in the proverbial profanity of the\\n      fish woman possibly the drug was proved on one of them.\\n      \\n The proving, as made by Dr. Dunham,\\n      shows that there were most profound changes in the mucous membrane of the\\n      tympanum, as well as of the drum-head. One of the most remarkable cases\\n      that I have ever seen was the action of this remedy in the person of a\\n      young married woman, Mrs. M., 21 years of age. She had had suppuration of\\n      the ear from childhood, and now that the responsibility devolved upon\\n      herself since her married life, she was very anxious to be relieved of\\n      this annoying conditions. The canal was large, tissues wasted, the\\n      drum-head undefined and oozing a thin, watery, most offensive discharge.\\n      Under Psorinum this was modified, and developed the characteristic odor of\\n      fish- brine. Under Tellurium, the appearance of the ear gradually changed,\\n      the discharge grew less, scales formed, were exfoliated, the outlines of\\n      the perforated drum-head came into view, the perforation headed, and, to\\n      my great surprise, a fair degree of hearing was secured. The cure was\\n      permanent, at least, so far as I know up to date. I have seen the lady\\n      frequently since, and the result is very gratifying.\\n      \\n The comparison that between this metal\\n      and the virus, Psorinum is unique. I admit that I had an intense prejudice\\n      against the latter remedy, but experience among the poor children at the\\n      Five-Points House of Industry, and later on at the Ophthalmic Hospital,\\n      overcame it entirely, and one need only study the wretched, puny,\\n      prematurely aged, with discharges of a cadaverous odor from the ears,\\n      stinking diarrhoea, stench of the very person, which is indescribable, but\\n      well recognized by those who have had experience with these cases who\\n      present themselves at our institutions, to be profoundly thankful for any\\n      remedy that will correct such conditions.\\n      \\n Chenopodium Anthelminticum.-Why should\\n      this vegetable select not only the auditory nerve but particular portions\\n      of it?

He\\n      remarked as each vehicle rolled by that it sounded like the roaring of\\n      immense cannons right into his ear; also annoying buzzing in the\\n      ears....During all the time his deafness, as described, was progressive,\\n      and became so pronounced as to make it impossible to talk to him. Still,\\n      there was the same kind of sensitiveness to other sounds. For example,\\n      when the tea bell rang, though he was on the third story, three flights\\n      from where the sound came, he, without notice from members of his family,\\n      to their utter astonishment, got up and walked as deliberately as ever\\n      into the dining-room.\".\\n      \\n Here we have a picture of profound\\n      effect upon the auditory nerve, and, more than that, not an abolition of\\n      function, but a modification which shows deafness to voice, but\\n      sensitiveness to both high tones and low tones. Clinically, it has proved\\n      curative for the low tones of the organ, 16- and 32-foot pipe, and should\\n      be thought of when there is in the patient the perception of high tones,\\n      like those of small bells, whistles, etc., and also a shrinking from low\\n      tones, the intermediate tones being either good or absolutely lost.\\n      \\n I have given thus rapidly pictures of\\n      remedies acting upon the sensory nerves of the tympanum, not involving the\\n      mucous membrane to a degree of inflammation or suppuration; also, remedies\\n      affecting the tympanum in such a condition of acute inflammation, and one\\n      remedy affecting the auditory nerve entirely independent of conditions of\\n      the middle ear.\\n      \\n These statements do not need any\\n      argument. They are too well known to those who are interested in this\\n      subject. If this be so, the question then arises, why is it that the\\n      profession does not use these remedies and similar remedies? Dr. Sterling\\n      has referred to one gentleman who does use them, and who has used them for\\n      years, to my personal knowledge, but when he offers them to his colleagues\\n      in a paper read in their hearing, they simply state that these are the\\n      remedies and the methods of Homoeopathy. Let the gentleman take them and\\n      go with them to those who practice sectarian medicine.\\n      \\n The simple fact is that we are none of\\n      us free from prejudice, and we are not likely to be freed from our\\n      prejudices. Here and there peculiar circumstances of association or\\n      accidental conviction lead one to the investigation of physiological\\n      medicine, which is Homoeopathy, and such persons modify their methods, if\\n      not their relations.\\n      \\n Perhaps it is not well to ask more in\\n      medical lines than we do in other lines of experience and conviction.', u'Tresorie - Clinical Experiences with Vinyl Ether [Clinical Experiences\\nWith Vinyl Ether]\\n ELMER H.STUMPF, M.D.\\n      \\n Buffalo,New York\\n      \\n THE search for the ideal anesthetic has\\n      become intense. When the anesthetists of this country and Canada organized\\n      some twenty years ago to form the International Anesthesia Research\\n      Society, the interest of physiologic and pharmacologic research workers\\n      was at once aroused. Since that day these men of the laboratory, in\\n      collaboration with our outstanding anesthetists, have brought about marked\\n      advances in methods of anesthesia.\\n      \\n Luckhardt produced ethylene; Gwathmey\\n      perfected colonic ether-oil analgesia for obstetrics; Waters of the\\n      University of Wisconsin gave us a real advance in gas anesthesia with his\\n      closed-circuit, carbon-dioxide absorption technic; pre-medication with the\\n      barbiturates synergizing morphine has been a boon to the operative\\n      patiently and the introduction in Germany of overtone as a basal\\n      anesthetic soon became international in extent. With the discovery of\\n      \"Spinocain\" by Pitkin, spinal anesthesia was popularized and its\\n      technic so perfected that it is safe in the hands of the expert.\\n      \\n During the past year, from the work of\\n      two pharmacologists, Henderson of the University of Toronto, and and Leake\\n      of California, came the announcement of cyclopropane and divinyl oxide or\\n      vinyl ether. Leake, noting the close chemical relationship better the\\n      formulae of ethyl ether, ethylene, and divinyl oxide investigated the\\n      latter in 1930, and demonstrated that it possessed anesthetic properties.\\n      With other workers, experimenting on mice and dogs, he found that\\n      anesthesia could be much more easily produced using vinyl ether than by\\n      using ethyl ether. with less struggling and excitement and less mucous\\n      secretion; that recovery was rapid, with nausea and vomiting less marked,\\n      leaving no significant pathologic effects on the various organs. It was\\n      preferable to either chloroform or ethyl ether.\\n      \\n Extensive physiologic, pathologic and\\n      clinical studies have since been made on the dig, the monkey and man. It\\n      has been shown that the anesthetic potency of vinyl ether is seven times\\n      that of ethyl ether and 1.3 greater than that of chloroform. At the same\\n      time there is a wider \"margin of safety\" between the anesthetic\\n      and lethal concentrations of vinyl ether in the blood as compared with\\n      those of the other two drugs. These longed divinyl ether anesthesia, but\\n      no liver necrosis ether to 500 patients of all ages and conditions and for\\n      operations of a very varied nature,. In these they encountered no untoward\\n      effects on respiration, circulation, liver or kidneys.\\n      \\n Believing that a very good estimate of\\n      the general effects of a drug may be made its action on the liver, Wesley\\n      Bourne, anesthetist and research worker of McGill University, has\\n      contributed some very interesting results from his studies. Vinyl ether\\n      was administered to normal dogs, to dogs with damaged livers, and to\\n      partially starved dogs, and the liver function eleven normal dogs show\\n      that vinyl ether administered for periods of one hour or more on three\\n      successive days does not alter the live function appreciably. In those\\n      cases where cyanosis was a feature of the anesthesia, moderate impairment\\n      of liver function occurred, but this was not directly due to the drug, but\\n      to the associated anoxemia.\\n      \\n For a study, measured degrees of liver\\n      impairment were produced by chloroform administration. At various times\\n      during the recovery period from chloroform poisoning, vinyl ether was\\n      given to determine whether additional liver damage occurred. It had been\\n      shown in the laboratory that chloroform always causes marked impairment of\\n      liver function. From seven experiments, Bourne found that vinyl ether does\\n      form poisoning, nor does it retard the progress of recovery. Furthermore,.\\n      repetition of vinyl ether on two successive days did not alter the period\\n      of recovery from chloroform poisoning at all.\\n      \\n With respect to starved dogs, since the\\n      glycogen reserve of the liver is lowered through starvation, four animals\\n      were place on half ration for three days, then given vinyl ether in order\\n      to observe its effect on glycogen-poor livers. It was found that there is\\n      no appreciable difference in the effects of vinyl ether in order to\\n      observe its effect on glycogen-poor livers. It was found that there is no\\n      appreciable difference in the effect of vinyl ether upon normal and\\n      starved dogs-that is, upon normal and glycogen-poor livers. Three\\n      experiments performed to determine accurately whether death from this\\n      anesthetic is respiratory or circulatory in character, when after one hour\\n      of anesthesia, showed that respirations ceased before the the heart\\n      stopped. This corroborated the work of other investigators.\\n      \\n Bourne decided that this should be an\\n      ideal anesthetic in obstetrics, and thus far has reported on over 300\\n      administrations at the Royal Victoria Montreal Maternity Hospital. The\\n      method used was to bubble oxygen through the dinyl ether in an apparatus\\n      using carbon dioxide absorption to preclude asphyxia and prevent waste. He\\n      found strikingly rapid induction, a few inhalations being sufficient,\\n      little excitement; and degree of muscular relaxation it compared favorably\\n      with ethyl ether. Post anesthetic nausea and vomiting were no more\\n      frequent than is usual in obstetrics. Tests of liver function showed\\n      practically no impairment. He concludes that vinyl ether is very suitable\\n      for employment in obstetrics, especially to replace chloroform.\\n      \\n Through the kindness of Dr. Beach,\\n      anesthetist of the Graduate Hospital of he University of Pennsylvania, who\\n      has been active in the clinical research work with this drug, I received a\\n      large supply for clinical trial from Merck & Co., the manufacturers.\\n      In the last several months we have administered vinyl ether, both by the\\n      drop method on the open mask; as an adjuvant to gas, replacing ethyl ether\\n      for muscular relaxation; and on the mask as an induction agent for ethyl\\n      ether, to some fifty patients. The operative procedures varied from\\n      incision of abscessed jaw, rib resection for empyema in several children,\\n      dilation and curettage in septic abortion with severe haemorrhage and\\n      consequent anemia, pelvic laparotomies, appendicectomies, breast\\n      amputation, and nephrectomies. It was given to children and adults.\\n      \\n In vinyl ether we have a highly\\n      volatile, clear, practically colorless liquid. It has a somewhat pungent\\n      odor, not at all unpleasant, that reminds one of ethyl chloride. It is\\n      inflammable with an explosiveness approximately the same as that of ethyl\\n      ether. It has a boiling point of 83 Fahrenheit.\\n      \\n We found that in using vinyl ether by\\n      the drop method on the open mask, rate of from sixty to eighty drops per\\n      minute, essentially the same as for chloroform, produced unconsciousness\\n      about as rapidly as does ethyl chloride. In most cases there was no\\n      excitement whatever, and if present at all, if was very slight. We noted\\n      an increase in salivation, particularly in cases in which there apparently\\n      was no irritation to the respiratory tract. Muscular relaxation was\\n      excellent, similar to throat obtained with ethyl ether. The recovery of\\n      consciousness was very rapid, and is comparable to that following nitrous\\n      oxide. Post-operative nausea or vomiting were practically nil.\\n      \\n When used in the gas apparatus as an\\n      adjuvant instead of ethyl ether, it was noted in several instances where\\n      administration was continued for some times that the systolic and\\n      diastolic pressure rose gradually, with a flushing of the skin which\\n      persisted for some time after the anesthesia was discontinued. In one\\n      case, a male, the systolic pressure advanced from 120 mm. to over 2 mm.\\n      Although vinyl ether has an advantage over ethyl ether as an adjuvant in\\n      that a much smaller quantity is needed, we believe that it is not\\n      advisable to use it for prolonged periods.\\n      \\n Its sphere of usefulness appears to be\\n      in minor surgery where a short period of anesthesia is sufficient; as an\\n      ideal replacement of chloroform in obstetrics; as the inducing agent for\\n      an ethyl-ether sequence when gas is not available. It permits of a very\\n      smooth change latter, overdosage striking at the respiratory system rather\\n      than the circulatory. This factor is prime importance in the chance of\\n      resuscitation.\\n      \\n Vinyl ether has certain rather serious\\n      disadvantages, among which are:.\\n      \\n (1) Its high degree of volatility which\\n      tends to waste fulness when used on the open mask.\\n      \\n (2) Its instability-undergoing chemical\\n      changes when exposed to light and air. The manufacturers state that it\\n      should not be used after the bottle has been opened twelve hours. A date\\n      limit is also stamped the label.\\n      \\n (3) Because of the low boiling point,\\n      and consequent increase of volatility in hot weather, its use in such\\n      periods would require constant watchfulness to prevent any of the\\n      reactions which may follow the use of a potent anesthetic.\\n      \\n (4) Because of its rapid action it will\\n      not allow of a too concentrated use-in other words-it cannot be\\n      \"pushed\".\\n      \\n From our experience we may say that\\n      vinyl ether should have a very definite place among anesthetic agents. It\\n      is outstanding as a pleasant, rapid anesthetic with quick recovery and\\n      safety comparable to that of ethyl ether. This should appeal to the\\n      average physician when the expert anesthetist and his gas apparatus are\\n      not available.', u'Tresorie - NOTATU DIGNUM [Test Of A Homoeopath]\\n\\n Complaints are not unfrequently made\\n      that the homoeopathic materia medica is too vast for practical utility;\\n      that the schematised list of symptoms are unprofitable, if not impossible\\n      reading. I do not think so. Indeed, I think that the test of a genuine\\n      homoeopath might not unfairly be said to life in his capacity to read\\n      through a Schema with both profit and enjoyment because of the\\n      possibilities it reveals of dealing with cases occurring every day in\\n      practice. Again and again in the course of my work I have come across\\n      symptoms in the Schemas of remedies reminding me of cases in the past\\n      which I might have cured had I but known the remedies then. And many a\\n      time a case has turned up in my practice calling for a particular remedy\\n      at the very time I have been working upon it, and a cure has resulted,\\n      when, but for my study of the Schema, I might more than likely have failed\\n      to find what was wanted. I think that the introductory sections preceding\\n      each Schema will make the study of the Schema profitable and enjoyable to\\n      some who have hitherto found it dry. And when we consider that the Materia\\n      Medica is the very raison detre of the homoeopathist, and that in it he\\n      must live and move and have his being, it is not too much to expect of him\\n      that he shall at least give as much mind to its cultivation as is required\\n      for maintaining high proficiency, say, in billiards, or in golf.', u'Tresorie - The Present Status of Radiation in the Treatment of Malignant\\nConditions [Present Status Of Radiation in the Treatment Of Malignant\\nConditions]\\n ISIDORE ARONS, M.D.\\n      \\n New York, N.Y.\\n      \\n AT A meeting of the American Medical\\n      Association recently held in Cleveland, Dr. Joseph C.Bloodgood, in\\n      discussing a paper on radiation therapy, said that \"report at my\\n      clinic told me that 49 per cent of the patients previously operated on in\\n      the clinic now to for radiotherapy. This is based on results. They are not\\n      hopeless cases; they are still hopeful and they get well under\\n      radiotherapy. This has happened during the last three years, not because I\\n      have changed any but because the method of radiotherapy has changed. A\\n      great change has taken place. First of all, radium and x-rays are no\\n      longer looked on a last resort.\".\\n      \\n The foregoing bears witness to the\\n      progress made in the field radiation therapy. The manufacture of more\\n      adequate apparatus and the improved technic in its use reflect this\\n      improvement. Machines are used generally delivering twenty to thirty\\n      milliamperes of current at 200 K.V., while machines operating at 750 to\\n      1,000 200 K.V., using lower milliamperes, have been installed in several\\n      places in this country. Since the question of increased voltages began to\\n      dominate the field, machines operating at 400 to 600 K.V., using sealed\\n      tubes, have been manufactured in this country as well as on the been\\n      manufactured in this country as well as on the continent. This higher\\n      powered machines occupy little more space than the usual 200 K.V. machine.\\n      \\n The effectiveness of these stronger\\n      radiations is thought to be due to (1) the increased penetration and its\\n      consequently larger percentage depth doses, (2) the supposed higher\\n      selective action of short have length radiation on malignant cells, and\\n      (3) greatly increased x-ray output. Clinics using super-voltages report\\n      that clinical results are somewhat better than those secured through the\\n      use of the lesser voltage machine.\\n      \\n Experimental effort, from the physical\\n      and biologic point of view, has been exerted to establish to standard\\n      basis for radiotherapy since Roentgens discovery thirtyfive years ago, and\\n      its application five years later. Radiotherapists have only recently begun\\n      to understand the principles of clinical application or radiotherapy in\\n      the treatment of malignant conditions.\\n      \\n Regaud selected the rabbits testicle\\n      for his experiments because its histologic cellular structure was highly\\n      sensitive to radiation, containing cells which are in a state of active\\n      mitosis resembling that of malignant tissue. In 1922, Regaud reported that\\n      of malignant, tissue. In 1922, Regaud reported that it was impossible to\\n      sterilize the testicle by a single dose of radiation without causing\\n      serious damage to the overlying skin. The dose required to produced such\\n      radio necrosis was equivalent to about three radionecrosis was equivalent\\n      to about three erythemas when administered in one dose. However, by\\n      dividing the dose in such a manner as to prolong the treatment over a\\n      period of fourteen days, a total dose of about five erythemas could be\\n      given causing complete sterilizations without damage to the skin. Thus it\\n      is seen that by prolonging the time of treatment the cutaneous dose could\\n      be increased nearly 50 per cent without causing necrosis.\\n      \\n The above experiments were reported,\\n      and the same results determined, by Schinz and Slotopolsky in 1926, and\\n      again by Regaud and Ferroux in 1927. These experiments formed the\\n      foundation for the clinical studies of Pfahler (America), Hohlfelder\\n      (Germany) and Coutard (France), who have swung the pendulum from massive\\n      radiation, as advocated by the German school, to that of the protected\\n      fractional dose method. Results have been achieved by this method which\\n      are superior to previously reported; these are obtained by the improved\\n      method of administering a large dose to the (3 days) without causing\\n      destructive effects to the surroundings normal structure (or cancer bed);\\n      its effect are rather biologic than physical. The clinical application of\\n      the method of radiation by Pfahler, Countard, and Berven (Sweden) in the\\n      treatment of cancer of the tonsil, pharynx and larynx and have proved the\\n      radio-sensitive properties of squamous carcinoma, previously considered\\n      incapable of of responding to radiation.\\n      \\n According to Coutard, the neoplasm is\\n      exposed to x-rays twice daily, giving a total dose of 350 r to400 r to two\\n      areas, using 190 to 200 k.v., four milliamperes, two millimeters of copper\\n      and three millimeters of aluminum filtration at a distance of fifty of\\n      sixty centimeters, for lesion of the head and neck. For deeply situated\\n      lesions, such as cancer of the uterus, the focal distance varies from 80\\n      to 100 centimeters, the area of the field for the head and neck conditions\\n      being only 50 to 100 square centimeters, while those of the lower abdomen\\n      require on an average of 250 to 300 square centimeters. For the\\n      sterilization of the radio-sensitive squamous carcinomatous growth, a\\n      depth dose of 3,000 r to 4,000 r is given, while stronger dose is\\n      necessary for the radio-resistant tumors.\\n      \\n In the course of treatment of principle\\n      guides a radio reaction of the covering epithelium and the radio reaction\\n      of the cancer cells. The radio reaction of the cutaneous epithelium is\\n      called \"radio epidermitis.\"characterized by loss of epithelial\\n      layers and denudation of the dermis. The reaction of the mucous membrane ,\\n      called \"radio epithelitis,\" manifests itself by loss of the\\n      epithelial layer sand denudation of the mucous membrane, epithelial layers\\n      and denudation of the corium which becomes covered by a fibrinous and\\n      false membrane; of clear. The duration of both describe radio reactions is\\n      six weeks. Each appears at the beginning of three weeks and disappears at\\n      the beginning of the ninth week.\\n      \\n Should the total or daily dose or the\\n      intensity per minute be too high, or the filtration or the tension too\\n      low, the cancer bed would be modified. the nutrition of the malignant\\n      cells becomes impaired The cellular radio- sensitivity, which seems to be\\n      linked up not only with the mitosis of the cell but above all with the\\n      activity of their interchange with the cell but above all with the\\n      activity of their interchange with the surrounding normal structures,\\n      becomes diminished and at times suppressed. The cancer cells become\\n      incentive to radiation. This phenomenon is called \"radio-\\n      vaccination\" by Regaud.\\n      \\n Observation of clinical facts shows\\n      that changes in the surrounding normal tissue result from excessive daily\\n      doses and intensity per minute per minute causing radio resistance of the\\n      tissue. Conversely, radio- sensitivity would be prolonged with a smaller\\n      daily dosage and the resultant extended period.\\n      \\n Realizing that better results may be\\n      obtained by prolonged treatment, Coutard and his collaborators in the last\\n      few years have begun to extend the duration of treatment of certain\\n      so-called radio-resistant cancers from thirty to ninety days, giving weak\\n      daily doses in order of about 175, 220, 225 and 250 r per day, dividing\\n      the dose in two treatments. By this method he was able to cure a certain\\n      number of lesions on which he had not been able previously to obtain the\\n      same results, such as very differentiated epidermoid epithelioma invading\\n      the muscles and cartilages, glandular epithelioma of the breast ad the\\n      thyroid body, and special round celled epitheliomas of the upper part of\\n      the ethmoid and the adjacent sinuses. This mode of prolonged treatment not\\n      only controlled the condition locally but it lessened the frequency of\\n      metastasis.\\n      \\n When radiating a cancer of very\\n      embryonic, very radio-sensitive growths, the energy factor is predominant.\\n      The action of the x-rays seems to be direct and rapid; the treatment can\\n      be accomplished within fifteen to twenty days. The cells are destroyed and\\n      generally normal structures are affected very little. When radiating the\\n      less embryonic type of growths, the time of treatment should be longer.\\n      \\n Pursuing these general principles, I\\n      have adopted the Countard method with some slight modifications. The cures\\n      which I shall illustrate will show that the percentage of cures in a\\n      number of most dangerous epidermoid carcinomas has markedly increased and\\n      that some conditions formerly considered hopeless have been temporarily\\n      cured. In conclusion I wish to emphasize the following facts:.\\n      \\n (1) Cure of cancer by x-rays is still\\n      difficult and must not be entered into lightly and causally.\\n      \\n (2) Radiotherapy is just as radical in\\n      method as surgery, and requires great skill, judgment and experience.\\n      \\n (3) The cooperation of the pathologist\\n      and the radiotherapist is imperative for a proper estimate of the\\n      radio-sensitivity in relation to treatment of the lesion.\\n      \\n (4) Daily examination of the patient is\\n      necessary; modification of the normal structure and general reaction by\\n      the x-ray treatment sometimes appears to quickly that it is often\\n      necessary to diminish the daily dose or the size of the field in the\\n      course of treatment.\\n      \\n (5) There exists no fixed method of\\n      treatment, only a simple clinical treatment for each individual patient\\n      and for the special type of tumor..\\n      \\n (6) Improvement in roentgen apparatus\\n      of higher voltages, producing more penetrating rays, will permit a better\\n      relation between destruction of malignant cells and preservation of the\\n      supporting, and the radio sensitivity of the tumor may be prolonged.', u'Tresorie - THE YEARS PROGRESS IN OBSTETRICS [Years Progress In\\nObstetrics]\\n\\n FOR several years progress in the art\\n      of obstetrics has been mainly along surgical lines, until so much\\n      operative work now pertains to the complete practice of this branch, that\\n      he who expects to rely upon himself in the hour of emergency must possess\\n      surgical skill. Moreover, requirements for the successful practice of\\n      obstetrics are daily becoming more exacting. Midwives and incompetents\\n      will ultimately be driven out of the field by the lash of public\\n      sentiment.\\n      \\n Symphyseotomy.-The old operations of\\n      Sigault, known as symphyseotomy, which had quite a run in the latter part\\n      of the last century, has been received in this our day by the Obstetric\\n      School of Naples, and thus far has a good record. In this country it has\\n      been employed but a few times, but the sentiment of accoucheurs appears to\\n      be friendly toward it.\\n      \\n It is only occasionally appropriate,\\n      and probably far less frequently in this country, and especially in the\\n      west, than in the more densely settled countries of Europe, where\\n      pauperism is more prevalent, and the people are harder worked and more\\n      poorly fed.\\n      \\n Ever since the original operation of\\n      Sigault fell into desuetude, obstetrician have busied themselves in\\n      efforts to devise methods for reducing the size of the fetal head to\\n      correspond to pelvic dimensions, and as a result, thousands of foetal\\n      lives have been sacrificed for want of the very expedient which had been\\n      cast aside.\\n      \\n It is unnecessary for me to sway that\\n      the secret of our success with Sigault\\'s operation to-day is found in\\n      cleaner methods and finer technique.\\n      \\n For some years Caesarean section has\\n      been the standard operation for in which the antero-posterior diameter of\\n      the brim was reduced as low as 2 3/4 inches; but recently a living child\\n      has been delivered by means of symphyseotomy when the diameter was only 2\\n      2/3 inches. The wonderful improvement in obstetrical results which this\\n      affords is at once apparent when we consider the vast difference in point\\n      of mortality between the two operations, Caesarean section and\\n      symphyseotomy. Nor is maternal life preserved at the expense of subsequent\\n      misery, for according to the reports thus far made, there are no disabling\\n      effects produced in the woman as the result of temporary disarticulation\\n      of the pubic bones.\\n      \\n Still we are recollect that the\\n      operation is yet on trial, and should lay corresponding restraint on our\\n      enthusiasm. The true value of it can better be told in a twelve-month.\\n      \\n After the os uteri has become fully\\n      dilated, and futile attempts have been to deliver with the forceps, or as\\n      soon as we find that the foetal head is unquestionably so decidedly out of\\n      proportion to the size of the pelvis delivery of a living child cannot be\\n      effected, the time has arrived for the performance of symphyseotomy.\\n      \\n The field of the operation is prepared\\n      in the usual manner (which preparation should include shaving the mons\\n      veneris and vulva), and an incision is made about two inches long in the\\n      median line, the lower limit of it being a point just above the clitoris.\\n      A few fibres of the rectus muscle are separated from the pubes on either\\n      side of the median line, and the finger is passed down along the posterior\\n      surface of the symphysis. Using the finger as both director and protector,\\n      a curved probe-pointed bistoury is then made to severe the articular soft\\n      structures, including the sub-public ligament, great care being exercised\\n      to avoid wounding the other structures. The articular surfaces are gently\\n      separated a few lines, the wound is examined for bleeding points, these\\n      being secured with fine catgut, temporary gauze packing is used and the\\n      forceps are applied. Delivery should be practiced with great care, and\\n      during traction effort the trochanters should be supported by the hands of\\n      an assistant. After delivery of the placenta the gauze is removed, the\\n      control of all bleeding assured, the articular surfaces are brought\\n      together and held by silkworm-gut sutures through the fibrous structures\\n      along the face of the bones, which fall within easy reach, and then the\\n      external wound is closed. In exceptional cases it may be wise to practice\\n      drainage for twenty-four hours. A tight bandage should be applied to the\\n      hips and firmly secured. The recumbent posture should be enforced for\\n      about four weeks.\\n      \\n The Caesarean Operation.-I am not aware\\n      that there has been any improvement worthy of mention in the technique of\\n      the Caesarean operation or its modification during the past year; but the\\n      sentiment is becoming nearly universal that the operation should be\\n      regarded as elective in the matter of time.\\n      \\n Formerly, the custom was to resort to\\n      surgical interference only after labor had been well established, and\\n      that, too, even in cases wherein delivery per vias naturales had been\\n      recognized as impossible.\\n      \\n Without pausing here to note the\\n      objections which have been made to early interposition, I may be allowed\\n      to emphasize the advantages arising from ante-partum operation, viz.:.\\n      \\n 1. A better opportunity for deliberate\\n      and painstaking preparation on the part of the operator is afforded.\\n      \\n 2. Daylight can be assured.\\n      \\n 3. The patient can be more thoroughly\\n      prepared.\\n      \\n 4. The vital powers of the woman have\\n      not become seriously impaired.\\n      \\n In view of the bearing of exact pelvic\\n      and cranial measurements on the selection of the most suitable operation\\n      for an individual case, I should not omit to direct your attention to the\\n      demand for more frequent use of the pelvimeter and careful estimate has\\n      established.\\n      \\n Sanger vs Parro.-Caesarean section,\\n      pure and simple, as practiced by Sanger, and Caesarean section as modified\\n      by Porro, are still rivals for surgical favor. In Italy, where it\\n      originated, the Porro operation is by far the most popular, while in\\n      Germany Sanger\\'s operation is in greater favor. the surgeons of this\\n      country have exhibited a preference for the latter method, though some of\\n      the best operators are outspoken in their preference for the former. Dr.\\n      Robert P. Harris, whose statistics are most elaborate and reliable,\\n      believes that Americans have food reason for preferring the improved\\n      Caesarean operation, inasmuch as twelve out of twenty-eight Porro\\n      subjects, up to the present time, have died, against five out of the last\\n      twenty- eight delivered under the other method. On the other hand,\\n      \"our success,\" says Dr. Joseph Price, who has thus far produced\\n      the best statistics of personal abdominal work which the world affords,\\n      \"in supra-vaginal extra-peritoneal hysterectomy for fibroids, and the\\n      low mortality accompanying the operation has assured our faith in the\\n      Porro operation.\" \"Hysterectomy should be performed,\" he\\n      continues, \"wherever the Caesarean section is necessary.\" Thus\\n      the controversy goes on, but out of the din and smoke of the tumult we\\n      gather indications of the advantage of the Porro over the Sanger operation\\n      for the use of the average surgeon and gynaecologist outside of hospital\\n      walls. It is more easily and expeditiously performed, and, what to my mind\\n      commends it still more, the possibility of future impregnation is\\n      prevented. The sentimentality in which some indulge, and the amiability\\n      which would encourage reproduction by such women of weak, deformed, and\\n      usually dependent children, should be discountenanced. The record which\\n      Rosenburg found of thirty-six cases wherein Caesarean section has been\\n      performed from two to five times on the same woman, is to my mind deeply\\n      revolting.\\n      \\n As in the case of supra-vaginal\\n      hysterectomy under other circumstances, some late operators have treated\\n      the stump according to various intra-abdominal or intra-pelvic, of not\\n      strictly intra-peritoneal, methods, but the ordinary operator will still\\n      prefer to fasten the stump at the abdominal opening.\\n      \\n Caesarean Operations vs.\\n      Craniotomy.-The accoucheur who possesses surgical skill will hereafter\\n      reserve his perforator, his craniotomy forceps, and his cephalotribe for\\n      use only upon the dead foetus, for, with the child still living, abdominal\\n      section and symphyseotomy are the operations to be considered. Upon a dead\\n      foetus, in a pelvis measuring in e excess of 3 or at the least 2 1/2\\n      inches, such instruments will afford occasional aid, but not elsewhere.\\n      This is the dictum of late obstetrical authorities, and yet I can conceive\\n      of an occasional case in the experience of those who have no surgical\\n      skill themselves and cannot readily summon those who do possess it,\\n      wherein an exception to this rule may properly lie. The practitioner who\\n      is inexperienced in surgery of the abdomen, but who is accustomed to\\n      obstetrical manipulation, will be instruments than with the knife; and to\\n      such cases, with an environment decidedly unfavorable so for as concerns\\n      consultative facilities, rigid rules cannot be applied.\\n      \\n Ischio-Pubiotomy.-I should not fail to\\n      refer to a congener of symphyseotomy known as Farabeuf\\'s a operation,\\n      which consists of section of the pelvis at a point about 2 inches to the\\n      right or left of the symphysis pubis, according to the direction of the\\n      pelvic contraction. It is intended for cases of obliquely contracted\\n      pelvis, wherein symphyseotomy would be comparatively ineffectual. The most\\n      recent example of this operation, of which I have seen a report, is from\\n      the clinic of Prof. Pinard, of Paris.\\n      \\n In order to make the result of this\\n      operation satisfactory, as it appears to me, the greatest care will be\\n      requisite, owing to the presence, at the site of section as designated, of\\n      the obturator nerve which supplies adductor muscles of the thigh. In\\n      measurements recently made on the cadaver, I find that the point of exit\\n      of this nerve, at the upper and inner margin of the obturator foramen, is\\n      just 2 inches form the symphysis. The obturator vessels are also found at\\n      the same point. To go to the outer side of this opening would materially\\n      diminish the danger of section, but the operator must recollect that that\\n      the nerve there lies close to the lower border of the horizontal ramus of\\n      the pubis. If section is made at a nearer point the body of thee pubis\\n      alone will be cut, and, owing to proximity of this line of incision to the\\n      symphysis, the special advantage of the operation over symphyseotomy will\\n      be measurably diminished. The best point for section is probably about 2\\n      1/2 inches fro the symphysis. The direction of the section will be\\n      downwards and somewhat inwards, the chain saw cutting first the transverse\\n      and then the descending pubic rami. Of course, the obturator nerve can be\\n      avoided by careful adjustment of the saw about the transverse ramus.\\n      \\n Pyrexia in the Puerperium.-Advanced\\n      notions concerning the treatment of puerperal pyrexia have been maintained\\n      and strengthened. I have frequently seen the temperature in the puerperium\\n      run up to 103 degree and 104 degree for a few hours and then subside under\\n      the influence of simple remedies, and therefore great haste in the matter\\n      of operative interference is by me discountenanced. But when the\\n      temperature is disposed to remain high, or when there is a decided rigor\\n      at the beginning of the pyrexia, with no explanation traceable to\\n      disturbance distant from the pelvis, little time should be allotted to the\\n      expectant plan of treatment. First of all, let the vagina be washed out\\n      with a gentle stream of hot boiled water. If the symptoms do not improve\\n      within a few hours, or if the temperature is only temporarily lessened,\\n      the uterus should be carefully washed out with plain boiled water, ample\\n      provision being made for the return of the fluid. Then seizing the cervix\\n      with a pair of bullet forceps and drawing it downwards until is within\\n      easy reach, the uterine cavity should be wiped out repeatedly with\\n      pledgets of absorbent cotton or iodoform gauze. If this should fail to\\n      give more than temporary relief, the organ should be curetted and packed\\n      with either iodoform or sterilized gauze, the end of the strip being\\n      allowed to trail into the vagina for drainage purposes. If up to this\\n      point the manipulation has been done with due regard to asepsis, the\\n      packing may safely be left twenty-four hours, and subsequently renewed if\\n      required. It may be unnecessary to say that all this manipulation would\\n      better be left undone unless it be done with strict regard to perfect\\n      cleanliness. A thoroughly clean vulva and vagina and uterus are absolutely\\n      essential, and the fingers of the operator, the instruments, and the\\n      packing material must be above suspicion.\\n      \\n If at the end of twenty-hours after\\n      packing the temperature does not approach normal, and the other symptoms\\n      do not evince corresponding improvement, we are left to infer that the\\n      cause of the disturbance, while originally within the tract which has been\\n      thus treated, has now located itself within the lymphatics, the veins, the\\n      tubes, or has invaded the peritoneal cavity. When this is true some\\n      practice laparotomy without delay, but, in view of the results of such\\n      operations, as shown by reliable statistics, I would still withhold my\\n      hand for a season, men while hoping to obtain from our deep-acting\\n      remedies results unlooked for by Old-School practitioners. This relegates\\n      laparotomy, in such cases, to the place of a dernier of a resort.\\n      \\n Episiotomy.-I am convinced, from what I\\n      have seen and heard, that the operation of episiotomy is far more commonly\\n      used than formerly. About three or four years ago I appealed to several of\\n      operation, and was surprised to find how few had become familiar with it\\n      in a clinical way. At that time I had resorted to it a few times, but of\\n      late I have had rather frequent recourse to it.\\n      \\n Whereas it was my former custom to make\\n      several small incisions on either side of the vulva, I now make but one on\\n      each side, and that of sufficient depth to give the needed circumference.\\n      The authors who mention the subject at all usually advise that the\\n      incisions be made with a knife, and that we leave the integument intact or\\n      nearly so; but this is not my practice. When the perinaeum is bulging, and\\n      the vulvar circle is tense, with every certainty of laceration, I slip the\\n      scissors under the thin margin and cut outwards and backwards from a half\\n      to three- quarters of an inch. By this means the vulvar circumference is\\n      greatly augmented and the perinaeum is saved. After delivery of the\\n      secundines I put two or three catgut sutures into each wound, and the\\n      result is usually a perfect vulva. I confess to a partiality for this\\n      operation, and have yet to meet the case wherein I have had occasion to\\n      regret any resort to it. Immediate Repair of Parturient Lacerations.-The\\n      demand for immediate attention to lacerations involving the vulva and\\n      vagina is becoming more imperative, while some teach and practice\\n      immediate suturing of even cervical rents. Surely the time is ripe for\\n      declaring that the accoucheur who fails to suture vulvar rents is guilty\\n      of gross neglect. Nor should one be allowed to escape censure under the\\n      plea that anything short of an extensive laceration is not reckoned by him\\n      as a laceration.\\n      \\n Suture of such wounds must be thorough,\\n      since otherwise the operations will prove unsatisfactory.\\n      \\n Asepsis.-Essential progress is being\\n      made by the great body of obstetric practitioners in the direction of\\n      thorough cleanliness in midwifery practice, but there is till much room\\n      for reform in this direction. The slackness of man by accoucheurs is truly\\n      appalling. Filthy instruments and filthy fingers appear to be the rule\\n      rather than the exception. Both students and practitioners need education\\n      along this line.\\n      \\n DISCUSSION.\\n      \\n L.C. GROSVENOR, M.D.: I don\\'t know, Mr.\\n      President, that I have anything to say to, this able paper. I have enjoyed\\n      it intensely. It is as full of met as a nut, and I am very glad to see our\\n      Homoeopathic obstetricians coming clear to the front on these very\\n      important subjects.\\n      \\n MARTHA G. RIPLEY, M.D.: I was very much\\n      pleased with the paper, and doubt if I shall be able to add anything to\\n      it. I wish to say that within a year or two I have had what I consider a\\n      very important method of using the forceps. I have never seen it mentioned\\n      in any work-in fact, it is directly in opposition to the rules that were\\n      given me for the use of forceps. In my obstetrical box I carry two sizes\\n      of forceps, the medium and the short, the very small. I have those small\\n      forceps with me at every case, and in cases where I fear a laceration of\\n      the perinaeum when the head bulges on the perinaeum, when I come to that\\n      point I stretch it. If I fear that the outlet is not sufficiently large,\\n      and I judge it impossible for the head to pass, then I take my scissors\\n      and make the last operation spoken of, on each side. When there is any\\n      pain and the ligaments are stretched, I make a cut on each side from a\\n      quarter to a half an inch, as I think best, putting in fingers as they are\\n      needed. That is very much better than is laceration of the perinaeum. I\\n      like that operation very much in case I fear there is to be a laceration.\\n      Now, to avoid a laceration, I have worked over the perinaeum and stretched\\n      it and dilated it as much as possible; then when there is no pain, I put\\n      in my small forceps. If a pain comes, I stop. I work when there is no\\n      pain, when every part is relaxed. I can get then the best results. I have\\n      tried it in hundreds of cases, and I can avoid a laceration of the\\n      perinaeum many times; and if I delivered with the forceps when there was\\n      pain, I would get laceration. I will say this: the patients are not\\n      frightened by the word forceps. I say to them, \"I have a little pair\\n      of spoons here that will help. I will shorten the operation.\" I think\\n      mine are the Higbee forceps -the smallest size you can find.\\n      \\n It has been said that you can use large\\n      forceps as well. I want to say that sometimes I can get along better\\n      without any forceps; but when you depend upon delivering without the pain\\n      and expulsive efforts, of nature, you have got to use a little force.\\n      Sometimes I get along without using any forceps. You cannot use force\\n      without pain:.\\n      \\n DR. HINGSTON: Almost the last words of\\n      one of the doctors was that he believed that it was almost a rule, rather\\n      than the exception, that obstetrical cases were attended without any care\\n      as to asepsis. Now, in my discussion of the paper before this one, I\\n      rather supposed that the people here thought that I was one of that class,\\n      and I don\\'t believe I look like a very dirty man. I am heartily in concord\\n      with the opinion that the greatest aseptic condition should be adhered to;\\n      and when I remarked that I thought it was perhaps better to stay out of\\n      the vagina than to go into it under certain circumstances, I don\\'t want to\\n      be understood that that was my method. On the contrary, if I had had time\\n      to finish, I would have said that after I go away from my cases, I insist\\n      that the nurse shall leave them alone-keep out of that domain. I permit\\n      none of these antiseptic washings that we have here recommended in the\\n      journals and elsewhere, to be carried out every day or twice a day. On the\\n      country, I believe that if we do not have trained nurses, we had better\\n      keep the nurse away from that domain. Let us make the vagina as aseptic as\\n      possible. Let us be as cleanly as possible. These are my views on this\\n      subject, and I was glad that this paper camp up after the other one,\\n      because I felt that I was misunderstood.\\n      \\n H.E. BEEBE, M.D.: The measures\\n      recommended are all very good, but I think it is quite well proven that of\\n      later years laceration of the perinaeum is more frequent when the\\n      shoulders are passed than when the head is passed.\\n      \\n SHELDON LEAVITT, M.D., in closing the\\n      discussion, said: I have nothing of importance to add, though I might say\\n      a few words with regard to the use of the forceps as mentioned, more\\n      especially by Dr. Ripley. These short forceps-these very short forceps-are\\n      a convenience, to say the least. The use of emollients, as mentioned by\\n      Dr. Ripley, is an excellent practice; but we must give what Graves\\n      demanded-the tincture of time, in which the perinaeum may accommodate\\n      itself to the size of the foetal head. But the cases of which I spoke, in\\n      which episiotomy is desirable, are those in which we have given the time,\\n      and the vulvar opening is hard and unyielding, and the head out of\\n      proportion to it. Under these circumstances, where laceration is received,\\n      from the experience which we have had, we may introduce the scissors and\\n      make the incision to which I have alluded.', u'Tresorie - SOME OF THE DISEASES PREVENTING AND COMPLICATION PREGNANCY\\n[Diseases Preventing & Complicating Pregnancy]\\n\\n STERILITY.-DeSinety, Treub, Furbinger,\\n      et al., attribute 50 per cent. of unproductive marriages to the husbands,\\n      saying that sterility in the male is more often the cause of barren\\n      marriages than is generally supposed.\\n      \\n This cause of sterility I pass by, as\\n      also sterility due to mechanical obstruction, incomplete ovulation and the\\n      numerous other causes of this condition, too manifold for mere\\n      enumeration, to consider obesity as a causative agent in this condition. I\\n      need not say that the advocates for surgical interference for the relief\\n      of this condition are legion. Sims makes the assertion that sterility can\\n      be cured by surgical means only. That, of course, is Allopathic arguing\\n      pure and simple. Cases requiring surgical interference do arise, but any\\n      treatment which raises the nutrition of the entire organism, improves the\\n      blood-formation, and favors the resorption of pathological products in the\\n      sexual organs, is to be regarded as the indicated remedy.\\n      \\n Published statements are my authority\\n      for saying that excellent results have followed the administration of\\n      drugs, nevertheless; and in complete defiance of all therapeutic measures,\\n      a certain percentage of women remain barren; for with the more occult\\n      causes of sterility we remain, as yet, unacquainted, consequently they\\n      cannot all be reached with say kind of treatment whatever.\\n      \\n The following case I report somewhat in\\n      detail. Whilst not an exceptional case at all, it bears directly upon the\\n      subject under consideration, and possesses, it seems to me, some decidedly\\n      interesting features. My object in selecting this particular one is to\\n      call attention, if possible, to a condition not sufficiently considered.\\n      Mrs. J., aet. 26, married about two years and a half, appealed to my\\n      knowledge for a reason as to why she remained childless. The lady was\\n      carrying an excess of flesh, being under the medium height, and weighing\\n      186 pounds, but appeared to be in good health; family and previous history\\n      all that could be desired. Examination showed none of the common causes of\\n      sterility; neither, so far as I could ascertain, was the husband\\n      responsible for this unproductive condition of affairs. Some previous\\n      experiences of my own, with the added testimony of other and able men, was\\n      my reason for charging this condition of things to the excess of flesh,\\n      this, by the husband, being laughingly charged to excess of laziness.\\n      \\n We all, undoubtedly, are familiar with\\n      that peculiar disease of the blood-corpuscles which, whilst producing\\n      flesh, relaxes at the same time the muscular force; acting also, I\\n      believe, upon the muscular fibres of the uterus and upon the ovaries,\\n      inducing not only serious menstrual disorders but sterility. McKee,\\n      Philbert, and others give several instances of sterility chargeable to\\n      obesity, the women in question having been married several years without\\n      bearing children, and all became mothers after losing a portion of their\\n      flesh. If any other argument were needed in support of this theory we\\n      might turn to the quadrupeds, where we find the poorest breeders among the\\n      fleshiest animals. Fournel has a very able treatise on \"The Effects\\n      of Obesity on the Menstrual Functions and Parturition.\" Without\\n      having had any actual case of this description to deal with, he inclines\\n      very strongly towards the belief that obesity favors sterility. In the\\n      treatment of the case before mentioned, the patient was subjected to a\\n      daily massage of the entire body, with a special pelvic massage three\\n      times a week. This, in the main, consists in elevating the uterus as high\\n      as possible with the finger in the vagina, ending with a quick and decided\\n      vibratory motion. The diet received particular attention, as at this time\\n      there was a slight gastric ailment. The indicated remedy, Thuja, was given\\n      in the minimum dose. At the end of three months almost thirty pounds of\\n      flesh was gone, a considerable reduction. As an experiment, I recommended\\n      coitus in the knee-elbow position, advising that the lady remain quiet as\\n      long as possible after coition, with thighs well flexed. She became\\n      enciente, but miscarried at eight weeks. There was, comparatively\\n      speaking, but little pain and not much subsequent haemorrhage. She made a\\n      rapid recovery. Since then a living child has been born to them.\\n      \\n I believe I am safe in saying that this\\n      result would hardly have obtained were it not for the prophylactic\\n      measures adopted.\\n      \\n At the end of the first two months the\\n      patient was attacked with haemorrhage. A similar occurrence took place at\\n      irregular intervals during the following five months, the quantity of\\n      blood lost being much greater than that at the normal menstrual period.\\n      \\n For the greater part of the last five\\n      months she kept her bed, at the end of which time the tendency of the\\n      uterus to empty itself could be resisted no longer. A seven months\\' child\\n      was born, and is to-day doing well.\\n      \\n Pseudocyesis cerebral pregnancy,\\n      phantom pregnancy (whatever name we may call it by) is a disease which\\n      must come under the head of those \"complicating pregnancy.\" Mrs.\\n      M., a lady, married two or three years, aet. 29. Previous history good,\\n      always enjoying perfect health. When I first saw the lady in question she\\n      was a perfect picture of health, and, according to appearance and her own\\n      statements, about seven months pregnant. I made no examination. This\\n      appeared to be a thoroughly intelligent woman, and, according to her own\\n      statement, there was cessation of the menses. There certainly was an\\n      enlargement of the abdomen and breasts, a milky secretion, and the lady\\n      was sure that she felt foetal movement. On February 28th of the present\\n      year I was called to attend her in labor. Examination showed that no\\n      pregnancy existed. So far as I could ascertain there was no assignable\\n      origin for this condition other than nervous influences, the phenomena\\n      being purely muscular distension of the abdomen.\\n      \\n Mayham reports a case of a woman 73\\n      years old, claiming to be pregnant; he also claims that subsequently she\\n      was delivered of a child; this is an Allopathic report, however, of which\\n      we will take a Homoeopathic dose. Haultain reports three cases of cerebral\\n      pregnancy. In the first, he says no cause whatever was to be found; in the\\n      second, there was a small fibroid growth in the anterior uterine wall.\\n      Hauck reports a case where the vomiting, peristalsis, and flatus, caused\\n      by alcoholism were supposed to be caused by the pregnant state. Such cases\\n      are uncommon, but they emphasize the importance of making a thorough\\n      examination, in all cases where positive information is desired of the\\n      existence or non-existence of pregnancy.\\n      \\n Hyperemesis Gravidarum.-An animated\\n      discussion, held recently between two celebrated Allopaths of Stuttgart\\n      and Leipsic, has served to awaken a renewed interest in this subject,\\n      without in the least adding anything new to our stock of knowledge\\n      regarding its aetiology. Notwithstanding the frequency of the vomiting of\\n      pregnancy, its very distressing character in many instances, and its\\n      imminent, its very distressing character in many instances, and its\\n      imminent danger, we find but very few contributions of any value, to\\n      either the aetiology of the disorder or its therapeutics. I do not expect\\n      to add anything specially new myself, but it does seem to me that our\\n      knowledge of the vomiting of pregnancy, is to say the least, in a most\\n      contradictory state. Some physicians look upon it as a trifling matter,\\n      others as a thing to be endured, and some-these are in the right too-view\\n      even the mildest cases with gravity. Even in the mildest cases of morning\\n      sickness there is a constant drain upon the nervous system, putting the\\n      sufferer into a condition, in which she is very much less able to endure\\n      parturition than she would otherwise have been.\\n      \\n Dr. Harrison Mettler says: \"After\\n      careful inquiry I find that women who suffer from much morning sickness\\n      have as a rule, tedious or otherwise troublesome labors. I have observed\\n      in multiparae that at one time they will have much nausea and vomiting\\n      followed by a difficult labor, while at another time they will be quite\\n      free from the vomiting, and will pass through the succeeding labor with\\n      comparative ease.\" I must say my observations make me agree with Dr.\\n      Mettler entirely; when one thinks how rapidly the mildest of cases assume\\n      pernicious forms, indifference is certainly no longer to be excused. There\\n      is a voluminous literature upon this subject, and many and varied are the\\n      aetiological reasons given for this very variable affection, a large\\n      majority of writers coinciding in the opinion that \"many causes\\n      operate together,\" to produce what we are pleased to designate the\\n      \"vomiting of pregnancy.\" I believe myself that in a large\\n      percentage of cases, this pernicious vomiting is simply the result of a\\n      reflex neurosis. Undoubtedly uterine displacements frequently cause\\n      vomiting; but when this is so, and the displaced organ is raised by\\n      packing the vagina with aseptic wool, the vomiting ceases.\\n      \\n Lillie reports a number of cases, where\\n      obstinate vomiting was caused by a retroflexed uterus, and restoration of\\n      the organ caused a cessation of the disorder. Bezugloff having a\\n      persistent case of morning sickness, introduced a bougie it no the uterus,\\n      the intention being to produce abortion; the immediate result was a\\n      stoppage of the vomiting, and the pregnancy went on to full term.\\n      \\n In the case just cited, I must say that\\n      I believe it was the fright, caused by the thought of abortion being\\n      performed, more than the effects of introducing the bougie, which operated\\n      so successfully; I say now, as I said before, I believe that the\\n      pre-eminent cause of this kind of sickness must be looked for i the\\n      nervous system. Flint speaks of this form of sickness as being decidedly\\n      neurotic in its origin, and cites a number of cases of a chronic variety\\n      of dyspepsia frequently occurring in young girls. I had one such case come\\n      under my personal care. There was a persistent morning sickness, with this\\n      young lady, and a disagreeable nausea whenever food was taken; this\\n      patient was at some distance from her home, in a boarding school, and she\\n      will probably never know that the lady principal entertained very grave\\n      thoughts at one time in regard to her virtue. It certainly was very\\n      difficult to differentiate between this and the vomiting of pregnancy; it\\n      was, however, simply due to a vitiated nervous system. My theory is\\n      supported by Alt, who records a number of such cases; I cite one only, the\\n      case being that of a highly hysterical woman, six months pregnant,\\n      suffering from the gravest vomiting, and anxious that miscarriage be\\n      induced. She was making preparation for entering the hospital for this\\n      purpose, when one of her children was seized with pneumonia. The anxiety\\n      felt over the child, forced all thought of self from the mother\\'s mind;\\n      from that moment the vomiting ceased and she remained well until the\\n      termination of pregnancy.-Minchener Medicinische Wochenschrift.\\n      \\n Whilst saying that I believe this\\n      disease to be in the majority of cases of purely nervous origin, I would\\n      not imply thereby that it is not to be feared, far from it; if neglected,\\n      we know how likely it is to pass quickly beyond treatment and our patient\\n      succumb from sheer exhaustion.\\n      \\n In the treatment cited such as\\n      insertion of bougies, dilation of the os, pelvic massage, etc., I believe\\n      it is merely the \"doing something,\" no matter much what it is,\\n      so long as you have gained the confidence of your patient, that does good.\\n      We have seen how suddenly Hyperemesis will cease if the patient be\\n      alarmed; it may be, has often been, and will to again, cured by a process\\n      skin to suggestion. Kattenback had a case where the patient, a primipara,\\n      was seized with an incorrigible vomiting. It was suggested to her that her\\n      stomach contained some lumps of unwholesome material and their removal\\n      would cure her. Some milk was given her, and the stomach ceremoniously\\n      washed out. its contents bore no indications of either over-acidity or\\n      abnormal ferment She was informed that she was all right and the vomiting\\n      would not return; neither did if, and she was safely delivered at term.\\n      \\n There is a familiar and now well-know\\n      phenomena, by which these neurotics can be influenced; I speak of\\n      hypnotism; it is due to purely subjective conditions.\\n      \\n There is an identity of the hypnotic\\n      susceptibility with the condition of hysteria, and it is along these lines\\n      that we can work. Just as many times as I have tried this method of\\n      treatment, for these cases of excessive vomiting, just so many times has\\n      it given me gratifying results.\\n      \\n The patient can be to sleep by\\n      bi-ocular pressure, and the idea of cure suggested; the operation may have\\n      to be repeated several times, at intervals of a day or so, but you will be\\n      rewarded by the cessation of the vomiting, often with but one suggestion.\\n      Where the patient is not easily controlled by means of the bi-ocular\\n      pressure, Luy\\'s revolving mirror is a never failing resource.', u'Tresorie - RECENT DISCOVERIES IN THE TREATMENT OF DISEASE BY THE USE OF\\nDISEASE-PRODUCTS, AND THEIR RELATIONS TO HOMOEOPATHY [Disease Products &\\nRelations To Homoeopathy]\\n\\n THE century now drawing to a close will\\n      pass into history as an era of wonderful advance. Never before has there\\n      been such ceaseless activity, such painstaking investigation in man\\'s\\n      efforts to discover and to control the forces of nature. Medicine shares\\n      in this spirit of discovery, and in the world of therapeutics the present\\n      is a period of great unrest.\\n      \\n In the Homoeopathic school this\\n      activity is displayed not so much in the addition of new therapeutic\\n      agents to our already extensive list, as it in a movement to systematize\\n      our present records of drug pathogenesy, to expunge that which is faulty,\\n      and to place what remains in a shape to be efficiently used. Faith in\\n      Homoeopathic methods was never stronger than it is to-day. It is this very\\n      faith that inspires the demand that the source of our therapeutics shall\\n      be reliable and authoritative. To this end effort is directed.\\n      \\n On the other hand, in the dominant\\n      school little confidence is shown in prevailing methods of treatment. new\\n      remedies are being energy sought, only to have brief title, to be as\\n      quickly abandoned.\\n      \\n This, also, is in keeping with the\\n      spirit of the day. Every new method of treatment that is introduced is\\n      submitted to test thousands of experimenters. If wanting in merit, it is\\n      soon rejected.\\n      \\n It is investigation of the nature\\n      indicated that gave to the medical world the synthetic antipyretics, which\\n      for a time enjoyed high favor. At last it was found that antipyrine has no\\n      power to control or to inhibit the heat-making process-it only promotes\\n      heat elimination. The salicylates have no specific action in\\n      rheumatism-they only obscure pain. With the fall of these two drugs form\\n      their temporary pedestal, less faith is reposed in the class of remedies\\n      to which they belong.\\n      \\n But investigators are not idle.\\n      Efforts, however, have taken another direction. After the lapse of a\\n      hundred years the medical world has turned its attention anew to methods\\n      closely allied to that discovered by Jenner, the treatment of disease by\\n      agents which are the products of disease. Inspired by the demonstrated\\n      success of Pasteur in the preventive treatment of rabies, experimenters\\n      are industriously working in this promising field. Necessarily,\\n      experiments are confined almost entirely to the lower animals, but the\\n      results obtained are, in many cases, definite, and gave promise that man\\n      may yet be made the beneficiary. In the lower animals infections diseases,\\n      artificially produced, that usually and fatally, may be led to a favorable\\n      termination by the injection of micro-organisms derived from other and\\n      similar infections diseases, or even by the injection of the\\n      micro-organisms of the same disease.\\n      \\n Again, it has been found that immunity\\n      to certain diseases may be conferred on animals by the injection of\\n      micro-organisms or their products-a state of immunity without which the\\n      animal would perish when attacked by the original disease. The injection\\n      of the blood-serum taken from and animal already in a state of immunity\\n      has been found to prevent the fatal effects of certain toxins when\\n      introduced into the system of the susceptible animal. A number of cases\\n      have been reported of recovery from tetanus after the injection of\\n      Antitoxin, a substance obtained from the blood of dogs artificially\\n      rendered immune to the infection of tetanus.\\n      \\n From knowledge gained by experiments of\\n      this class, it is probably that new and valuable methods for the\\n      prevention and cure of disease will be developed. The results already\\n      attained are striking and significant. They are in line with the work\\n      accomplished by Jenner and Pasteur.\\n      \\n Of new therapeutic methods none\\n      surpasses in interest that introduced by Murray, of England-the treatment\\n      of myxoedema by the administration to the patient of Thyroid extract. It\\n      having been conclusively shown by Mr. Victor Horsley, in 1884, that\\n      myxoedema is due to loss of function of the thyroid gland, Murray\\n      conceived the idea of treating the condition by the injection of Thyroid\\n      extract. In October, 1891, he reported his first case, which gave very\\n      satisfactory results. Since that time Murray and others have treated\\n      altogether a large number of cases, and it is now possible to form some\\n      estimate of the value of the treatment.\\n      \\n The method pursued, as first devised by\\n      Murray, was to inject subcutaneously a Thyroid extract, made by macerating\\n      the recently removed thyroid gland of the sheep, which is then treated\\n      with Glycerine and a weak Carbolic acid solution. A dose, consisting of\\n      from ten to twenty-five minims of this extract, is slowly injected beneath\\n      the skin. But, since the hypodermatic injections are sometimes followed by\\n      abscess, Dr. Hector Mackenzie, in October, 1892, adopted a modification of\\n      Murray\\'s treatment, which consists of feeding to the patient the extract,\\n      or even the gland itself. It is found that the results obtained are fully\\n      as satisfactory as those following the use of the subcutaneous injection\\n      of the extract. To the present time the gland has been used in four\\n      different forms-as an extract, a powder prepared by desiccation of the\\n      extract, the raw gland, and, most remarkable of all, the gland after\\n      having been fried. Thus it would seem that the active principle contained\\n      in the gland is not destroyed even by heat. used in any one of the forms\\n      named, the remedy seems to be equally efficacious.\\n      \\n As a result of this method of\\n      treatment, many cases of complete recovery from myxoedema have been\\n      reported by competent clinicians.\\n      \\n The time required in order to bring\\n      about a cure varies in different cases from several weeks to several\\n      months or a year. At the end of the period all signs of the disease have\\n      disappeared; the oedema subsides, the face and hands become natural in\\n      size, the speech is restored, the spirits brighten, the temperature rises\\n      to normal, the skin becomes soft, smooth, and moist, and, most conspicuous\\n      of all, the previously bare scalp becomes covered with a heavy growth of\\n      hair. In a word, all lesions and symptoms of the malady disappear, and the\\n      patient is restored to perfect health.\\n      \\n The size of the dose of the gland or\\n      its extract, it is found, must be carefully regulated in order to obtain\\n      the best results. An excessive dose produces cardiac irregularity,\\n      syncopal attacks, and can even cause death. But, administered with the\\n      care that would be given to any other agent,it is safe and efficacious.\\n      \\n It may be announced that a specific for\\n      a heretofore incurable chronic disease has been found. There is but one\\n      qualification that must be made, but that is a serious one-the recovery is\\n      not permanent unless the treatment is continued throughout the lifetime of\\n      the patient.\\n      \\n But, notwithstanding this one\\n      disadvantage-the necessity for the continued use of the remedy-Murray\\'s\\n      method of treatment of myxoedema may be said to be a great therapeutic\\n      triumph.\\n      \\n The mode of action of the Thyroid\\n      extract in the disease in question would seem to be not difficult to\\n      understand. it has been pretty conclusively shown, by the researches of\\n      Mr. Victor Horsley, that the thyroid gland plays an important part in\\n      keeping the blood in normal condition and in maintaining the natural\\n      metabolism of the tissues. The thyroid gland thus imparts to the blood\\n      some element or principle that neutralizes the tendency to the peculiar\\n      degeneration of tissue that occurs in the diseased condition known as\\n      myxoedema, and it is shown that this same element or principle can remove\\n      the degeneration after it has once occurred. The Thyroid extract and the\\n      gland, when ingested, evidently supplies to the blood the principle that\\n      is wanting by reason of loss of function of the gland in the victim of the\\n      disease.\\n      \\n It might be a satisfaction to be able\\n      to find some Homoeopathic relation of the remedy to the disease in this\\n      instance. But this can hardly be done. On the contrary, it seems to be an\\n      instance of the revival of an ancient practice under more scientific\\n      auspices, the treatment of conditions depending on damaged organs by the\\n      administration of such organs or their secretions. The method under\\n      consideration, therefore, is a marked example of the treatment of disease\\n      according to isopathy. The terms isopathy is applied to two distinct\\n      practices. One of these, and the one applicable in the present instance,\\n      is \"the theory of curing a diseased organ by the use of the analogous\\n      organ of a healthy animal.\".\\n      \\n Hence, we must conclude that the\\n      treatment of myxoedema by the use of Thyroid extract is the practice of\\n      isopathy.\\n      \\n There is another therapeutic agent, of\\n      comparatively recent introduction, belonging to the class of those which\\n      are the product of disease action that is sell worthy of consideration at\\n      this time. Following the lead of Pasteur, investigation in this field is\\n      now very active and renewed attention is being given to the agent\\n      indicated. I refer to that which has been isolated and presented to the\\n      profession by Koch- Parataloid or Tuberculin. Notwithstanding the\\n      premature announcement of the alleged virtues of Tuberculin and the\\n      extravagant claims made in its, favor, there is now evidence that would\\n      seem to indicate that it will yet prove to be a remedy of great value. If\\n      this be true, it will have a definite place in the Homoeopathic\\n      Pharmacopoeia. it is for the purpose of reviewing what has already been\\n      done in this direction that the subject is now brought to your attention.\\n      \\n The substance under\\n      consideration-Tuberculin-is, probably, the most powerful agent ever\\n      introduced into medicine. In describing its action, Hime says: \"It is\\n      a tremendously powerful substance. An ordinary injection represents 0.001\\n      mgr. of the liquid. This contains only about the 1-1000 part of active\\n      material, or about the fifteen millionth part of a grain. Yet this\\n      infinitesimal fraction can set the whole body of a man weighing two\\n      hundred pounds in such a state of change that the whole is raised to a\\n      temperature of 104 degree or 105 degree F. The weight of the mass thus\\n      affected is infinitely greater than that of the active agent, the exact\\n      proportion being about 1- 98,000,000,000.\\n      \\n No other substance known to medicine\\n      will, in so small a quantity, produce such profound effects. Atropine,\\n      Aconitine, Glonoine, and even the snake-poisons, in like minute quantity,\\n      would produce no perceptible systemic disturbances.\\n      \\n Tuberculin is a glycerine extract of a\\n      pure culture of the bacillus tuberculosis. And yet it appears that it is\\n      not identical with any ptomaine produced in the organism by the bacilli in\\n      the process of disease. Its exact character is not defined. The active\\n      principle seems to be closely allied to protein bodies. That it does not\\n      belong to the group of so-called to protein bodies. That it does not\\n      belong to the group of so- called Tox-albumins is indicated by the fact\\n      that it resists high temperatures and can be readily dialyzed. A\\n      precipitate is obtained by the use of 60 per cent. alcohol, which gives a\\n      snow- white mass that is almost pure Tuberculin.\\n      \\n This new possesses one property that\\n      adds much to its interest. The universal testimony is that it has an\\n      elective affinity for tuberculous tissue. Koch says: \"There is a\\n      general consensus of opinion that the remedy has a specific effect on\\n      tuberculous tissue.\" To this may be added the testimony of Virchow,\\n      who says; \"It acts in a remarkably selective way.\" Virchow\\n      further remarks: \"Evidence of its specific power is found in the\\n      marked indications of inflammatory action around ulcerated areas and in\\n      contiguous lymphatic glands\".\\n      \\n In order to assign this powerful agent,\\n      Tuberculin, to its proper place n the homoeopathic Materia Medica-if it is\\n      entitled to any such place-two things must be determined: first, the\\n      nature of its pathogenetic effects upon the healthy; and second, its\\n      curative action when applied according to the indications of these\\n      pathogenetic effects.\\n      \\n Unfortunately, there have been no\\n      systematic \"provings\" of Tuberculin, and we must, for the\\n      present, depend upon the records furnished by a few experiments. it will\\n      be seen, however, on examination of these records, that the pathological\\n      effects of Tuberculin are more or less constant and uniform.\\n      \\n In the subject tuberculosis, the\\n      injection of a small quantity of Tuberculin is followed by a most profound\\n      disturbance of the system. There is great and rapid rise of temperature,\\n      and, as set forth by Virchow, increased destruction of tubercular tissue,\\n      with its absorption and dissemination throughout the body. This is\\n      accompanied by great aggravation of the disease from which the patient\\n      already suffers. But it is the effect of the remedy in the healthy subject\\n      that we are interested in inquiring into. Koch relates the results of such\\n      experiments. The first subject was Dr. Kitisato, who, June 24th, received\\n      an injection of two milligrammes. Four hours after the injection an attack\\n      of coughing came on, which continued for three hours. Five hours later, or\\n      eight hours after the injection, the temperature was affected, and\\n      gradually rose from 97.7 degree to 100.94 degree F. The pulse rose form 72\\n      to 92, and these symptoms were attended by headache, languor, and\\n      perspiration.\\n      \\n Dr. A. Wassermann received, June 25th,\\n      an injections of 3 milligrammes. In the course of eleven hours his\\n      temperature rose from 98.06 degrees to 101.66 degree F., and his pulse\\n      form 80 to\\n      \\n&nbsp92.\\n      \\n Dr. H. Mass received, July 13th, an\\n      injection of 4 milligrammes. In the course of the twelve course his\\n      temperature rose from 98.6 degree to 102.0 degrees, and his pulse from 72\\n      to 100. He had slight rigors, a feeling of heat, perspiration and\\n      vomiting.\\n      \\n Dr. P. Guttman, July 28th, received an\\n      injection of 8 milligrammes. Within eight hours his temperature rose from\\n      97.7 degrees to 102.56 degrees F. The pulse rose from 78 to 135. This was\\n      accompanied by rigors, heat and sweating.\\n      \\n From these records it may be seen that\\n      the pathogenetic effects of tuberculin are as constant and uniform as are\\n      those of arsenic, opium or other drugs with known specific action.\\n      \\n The character of its effects may be\\n      thus summarized.\\n      \\n After a period of about eight hours\\n      from the time of the injection, the reaction begins. First, there is\\n      lowering of temperature, followed by a rise, reaching its maximum in about\\n      twelve hours. Other constitutional symptoms are: chilliness or rigors,\\n      headache, pain in the back or through the body, nausea, vomiting,\\n      prostration. Another noteworthy symptom is that there is a short, dry\\n      cough, even in provings on healthy subjects, those whose lungs are sound.\\n      \\n Those symptoms subside after\\n      twenty-four or forty-eight hours. Provings have not as yet gone beyond the\\n      point here indicated. If pushed further, the indications are that it would\\n      produce most profound disturbance and even endanger life.\\n      \\n Let us now examine the records of the\\n      use that has been made of tuberculin by Homoeopathic physicians.\\n      \\n Reports of cases treated have been made\\n      by Drasche, of Austria; Furbringer, of Germany; Jousset, of Paris;\\n      Burnett, of England, and Arnulphy, of Chicago.\\n      \\n Drasche treated fourteen cases, six of\\n      which were improved and eight aggravated. Furbringer treated forty cases,\\n      three of which were cured and fifteen ameliorated.\\n      \\n Dr. Arnulphy\\'s cases are of exceedingly\\n      great interest, both because of the favorable results attained and because\\n      they include cases of acute tuberculosis.\\n      \\n The first case Dr. Arnulphy reports is\\n      of a young woman, 26 years of age. For six or seven months there had been\\n      slight symptoms of pulmonary trouble, consisting of dry cough and\\n      emaciation. Suddenly her symptoms became acute, and the disease made rapid\\n      progress. She showed great weakness, pallor, great emaciation and almost\\n      incessant cough, rapid breathing, temperature of 105 degrees F., profuse\\n      perspiration at night and abundant diarrhoea. Over the right lung the\\n      respiratory sounds were obscure. The left lung was much affected; at the\\n      apex there were moist rales, surrounded by a zone of sub-crepitant rales;\\n      at the base, bronchial bubbling rales. The diagnosis was acute\\n      tuberculosis and the prognosis grave, if not fatal.\\n      \\n Tuberculin was prescribed. From the\\n      first dose the cough abated, the breathing became easier, and in a few\\n      days the patient\\'s condition had so much improved in all respects that she\\n      was pronounced to be out of danger. Two weeks later she was cut, and\\n      shortly after left her home in Chicago and made a journey to the far west.\\n      The woman is still living.\\n      \\n Dr. Arnulphy reports four other cases,\\n      all of acute phthisis, which were treated successfully, most of which are\\n      as remarkable as the one already detailed.\\n      \\n As a result of his experience, Dr.\\n      Arnulphy remarks: Judging by the success achieved, I am justified in\\n      saying that the proper field for the activity of tuberculin is acute\\n      tuberculosis- precisely those cases which Koch and his followers\\n      persistently, and, from their standpoint, constantly refused to treat with\\n      the lymph, on account of the reaction that they dreaded.\".\\n      \\n Burnett, of England, reports a number\\n      of cases cured; but his records are so wanting in scientific precision\\n      that it is impossible to give a satisfactory summary of the results.\\n      \\n The question of great interest is: Is\\n      the action of tuberculin in the cure of tuberculosis Isopathic, or is it\\n      Homoeopathic?.\\n      \\n In order to answer this, it is\\n      necessary again to define the term.\\n      \\n Isopathy may be said to be \"The\\n      treatment of disease by one or more of its own products\".\\n      \\n One lexicographer, in illustrating this\\n      definition, says: \"Thus, smallpox should be treated by the\\n      administration internally of the various excretions\".\\n      \\n If Koch\\'s tuberculin has a curative\\n      action in tuberculosis- as would now seem to be established from be\\n      experience of those Homoeopathic physicians who have already reported on\\n      the subject- it follows that the action is isopathic, if the tuberculin of\\n      Koch is a product of the diseased process known and recognized as\\n      tuberculosis.\\n      \\n Let us see if this be true. Koch\\'s\\n      tuberculin is a preparation made from a pure culture of the bacillus\\n      tuberculosis. The bacilli used may be removed two, three or even one\\n      hundred generation from the original. A glycerine extract of the medium of\\n      culture is made; this is filtered through plaster- of-Paris, and from this\\n      an alcoholic precipitate is obtained, which, in attenuation, is the\\n      medicinal preparation employed in the treatment of disease.\\n      \\n That the preparation thus obtained is\\n      not a product of disease is evident. it is a product of the artificial\\n      cultivation of a certain bacillus, which may be removed a hundred\\n      generations-yes, a thousand, an indefinite number of generations from the\\n      original. It is not a product of disease; it is a product of the\\n      test-tube.\\n      \\n But if the product thus obtained were\\n      identical with the ptomaine produced i the lungs or other organs in\\n      disease, we could not them deny the isopathic relation of the remedy to\\n      the disease. But the evidence furnished by the pathogenetic action of\\n      tuberculin does not support this view. Burnett truthfully says: \"If\\n      you alter some-what two things that are identical, then the identity\\n      becomes similarity\".\\n      \\n If the ptomaine produced in the system\\n      of the tuberculous patient were identical with that produced by the\\n      culture process followed by Koch, a minute quantity of it would speedily\\n      overwhelm the system. This does not occur. it is safe to say that the\\n      amount of the ptomaine produced in the system of the victim of\\n      tuberculosis is almost without limit. If this product were identical in\\n      nature with the tuberculin of Koch, tuberculosis would, in every case, be\\n      one of the most rapidly fatal of all diseases; the duration of the attack\\n      in every case would be but a few days, instead of weeks and months and\\n      years, according to its present history.\\n      \\n Of the artificial product, tuberculin,\\n      the 0.001 mgr. will produce the most profound effects upon the system, in\\n      a few hours raising the temperature from normal to 104 degrees or 105\\n      degrees F. In the systems of those already affected by tuberculosis, its\\n      effects are even more disastrous. Now, if the product of the disease\\n      process and of the culture, process were identical, then the effects of\\n      the two should not differ in any respect whatever. The evidence adduced,\\n      therefore, supports the conclusion that the action of Koch\\'s tuberculin in\\n      the cure of tuberculosis is not Isopathic, but, on the country, that it s\\n      Homoeopathic.\\n      \\n Jousset says: \"Homoeopathic only\\n      will be able to make intelligent use of tuberculin. We know that it is a\\n      powerful agent that has a specific action in tuberculous affections. We\\n      know why it is useful in phthisis; it is because, administered in a large\\n      dose, it aggravates in phthisis; it is because, administered in a large\\n      dose, it aggravates in phthisis. This is because the remedy is\\n      Homoeopathic to the diseased condition; that is to say, it is a remedy\\n      that will cure a diseased condition similar to that which it produces in\\n      the healthy subject. And since it is a Homoeopathic remedy, we know it\\n      must be indicated by the totality of the lesions and the symptoms.\\n      Consequently in order to complete its pathogenesy it is necessary to know\\n      in what class of cases of phthisis it is indicated and in what it is\\n      not\".\\n      \\n If the view that I have here set forth\\n      is correct, them the conclusion is warranted that the action of tuberculin\\n      as a remedy for tuberculosis is not an example of Isopathy. On the\\n      country, the evidence at hand would seem to indicate that its action is\\n      distinctly Homoeopathic. This being granted, then it must be accepted as\\n      true that Koch\\'s important discovery is but another illustration of the\\n      law of similars, and a notable demonstration of the power of\\n      infinitesimals in the cure of disease.', u'Tresorie - A PLEA FOR EARLY OPERATION IN PLEURISY WITH EFFUSION [Early\\nOperation In Pleurisy With Effusion]\\n\\n TWO articles appearing recently-the one\\n      by Dr. Barrs, in the British Medical Journal, dealing more especially with\\n      the dire results of pleuritic effusion, the other by Dr. Lindsay, in the\\n      Lancet, touching more on the advisability of early interference in such\\n      cases-have brought out very suggestive points for us to consider.\\n      \\n It is, however, with some hesitation\\n      that I have undertaken to direct the attention of this Society to so\\n      familiar and well nigh hackneyed a subject as pleural effusion and\\n      empyema. I feel somewhat at case, though, in doing so, because the disease\\n      in question, however familiar, possesses and exceptional clinical\\n      interest, and because there are many points in its ultimate pathology,\\n      perhaps aetiology-and more especially its treatment- around which much\\n      controversy has raged and is still raging. It is out of the question to\\n      handle exhaustively so vast a subject as pleural effusion and empyema. I\\n      will therefore limit my remarks.\\n      \\n There can be no doubt, in my opinion,\\n      that there is a strong and growing tendency to employ operative measures\\n      by those who see much pleurisy, and who are able to keep track of these\\n      sufferers for months or years after their original attack.\\n      \\n It is only in this collective method\\n      that we shall be able to speak pro and con for early operative methods.\\n      \\n As the best thinking and scientific\\n      minds of the Old and some of the New School are busying themselves most\\n      with preventive medicine, and then with curative medicine, it seems to us\\n      that a more fitting field for such investigations does not exist than in\\n      the one under discussion.\\n      \\n In orthopaedic surgery much has been\\n      learned and discovered within the past ten years-recognizing disease early\\n      (by experts), by suitable appliances rectifying deformities, and if they\\n      already exist, minimizing them to a marked degree.\\n      \\n In pleurisy a similar picture should\\n      the presented.\\n      \\n Unrecognized pleurisy, or pleuritis\\n      with effusion, maltreated leads to a maiming of the lung, its disability\\n      to perform more than one-third of its proper work, phthisis and lateral\\n      curvature of the spine, etc.\\n      \\n Curative medicine, then, in such cases\\n      must be looked for in two directions: first, as a power to promote\\n      recovery from injury of external origin; secondly, as a power to mitigate\\n      or remove diseases arising within the body.\\n      \\n And again, we are led in such cases by\\n      our old habits of thought to regard life as a thing of the body alone, and\\n      to forget that life lies between the body and the medium, and is, as it\\n      were, a play of activities between two surfaces, so that the medium needs\\n      as much curative vigilance as the body does, and is far more within our\\n      power and comprehension.\\n      \\n Therefore the prominent, and often even\\n      exclusive, place given to the administration of medicines and the\\n      swallowing of drugs is not only questionable, but positively mischievous,\\n      in so far as it leads the public, not to mention ourselves, to attach\\n      primary importance to measures at best auxiliary, and in so far as it\\n      blinds us to the far greater importance of studying the earlier and lesser\\n      deviation of function, and of readjusting the conditions under which the\\n      individual lives exist.\\n      \\n Those of us who may have made many\\n      post-mortems or witnessed them attentively, must have been impressed with\\n      the great frequency with which adhesive pleuritis was met.\\n      \\n And it seems to me that it matters\\n      little where these adhesions are found, but that they must represent just\\n      so much mechanical interference with the act of respiration and\\n      interchange of oxygenation during the act of respiration.\\n      \\n To properly understand the gravity of\\n      all pleuritic effusion we should appreciate somewhat the pathology of such\\n      cases.\\n      \\n The changes which take place in an\\n      inflamed pleura are essentially the same as those met in other serous\\n      membranes. The earliest stages are indicated by capillary congestion, and\\n      sometimes ecchymotic spots in the subserous tissue, with extravasations of\\n      blood into the pleura itself; the membrane then loses its smooth, glossy\\n      surface, becoming rough, dull and opaque, and is soon covered by a\\n      delicate gray deposit, consisting of fibrin, epithelium and young cells,\\n      and as this deposit increases apparently layer by layer, it becomes\\n      yellowish in color.\\n      \\n These changes are observed both on the\\n      parietal and pulmonary pleura.\\n      \\n In the rare cases in which a more or\\n      less diffused pleuritis stops here, and is not followed by liquid\\n      effusion, the inflammatory products are either entirely absorbed, or-which\\n      occurs most frequently-the opposing surfaces become adherent in whole or\\n      in part by organized connective tissue, and the sac is obliterated over\\n      the adherent areas.\\n      \\n Complete obliteration over the bases is\\n      seen chiefly in severe and long standing cases, where absorption has been\\n      left to its own judgment, or after empyema.\\n      \\n Mehu and Laboulbene have justly\\n      maintained that the ultimate recovery of the patient will proceed more\\n      slowly or more rapidly, according as the exudations are more or less\\n      fibrinous.\\n      \\n The next step to congestion and\\n      fibrinous exudation is the effusion of fluid.\\n      \\n All pleuritic effusions lead naturally\\n      to a number of local and general pathological conditions, partly owing to\\n      the quantity and quality of the exudations themselves, and partly in\\n      consequence of the changes which these exudations gradually undergo. The\\n      amount of the exudation will limit the amount of the compression of the\\n      subjacent organs, as the mediastinum, the opposite lung, the great venous,\\n      arterial, and nervous trunks, the diaphragm, the chest wall, liver,\\n      stomach, etc.\\n      \\n In fibrino-effusions-which frequently\\n      met with at the onset of all pleurisies-recovery commences in most cases\\n      by the gradual concentration of the exudation. In consequence of this the\\n      absorption proceeds much more rapidly at the beginning than it does later\\n      on. Finally, the fluid portion of the exudation may entirely disappear,\\n      and the pleural surfaces, roughened by deposits, come again in contact and\\n      often become fused together.\\n      \\n If the process of absorption sets in\\n      sufficiently early, the compressed lung again becomes permeable to air and\\n      re-expands.\\n      \\n We must still form an accurate idea of\\n      the anatomical changes which arise in those chronic cases in which the\\n      exudative deposits become organized into connective-tissue masses.\\n      \\n In the course of the pleuritis we not\\n      repeated exudations taking place which undergo organization, harden, and\\n      finally are found in layers sometimes an inch in thickness.\\n      \\n The serous and sub-serous tissues are\\n      often merged into this new formation, and are hard to distinguish from it.\\n      \\n If the pleura pulmonalis is affected,\\n      it always appears thicker on section and shrunk on the surface.\\n      \\n This leads to a shrinking and\\n      retraction of the subjacent lung tissue, the hilus of the lung forming the\\n      centre of the retraction, while the margins of the lung become rounded by\\n      this pleuritis deformans.\\n      \\n This retraction leaves a free space in\\n      the pleural cavity which becomes filled with fluid, which has little\\n      chance of being absorbed the thicker the two pleural surfaces become. The\\n      pleura, in such a state, rapidly loses its absorbent power.\\n      \\n Thus the capability of expansion in\\n      such a lung is forever last.\\n      \\n Again, if the pleura becomes covered\\n      with thick false membranes while there is still considerable effusion in\\n      the pleural cavity, and before its absorption has been possible, this\\n      circumstance hinders its further absorption, and the remainder of the\\n      exudation may thus remain for months or years encapsulated.\\n      \\n The thicker and more fibrous the false\\n      membranes, the less vascular are they.\\n      \\n This organized false membrane sometimes\\n      assumes a pyogenic character, from which pus is continuously secreted.\\n      When the fluid effused in the earlier stages of the disease becomes\\n      absorbed and no new liquid (serous or purulent) effusions are poured out\\n      between the layers of exudation, the lung must, in such cases of pleuritis\\n      deformans, diminish more and more in size.\\n      \\n The adjacent movable organs, as well as\\n      the thoracic walls, must contribute to the filling up of this vacuum.\\n      \\n The different character of the\\n      effusions, whether serous, sero-fibrinous, purulent or haemorrhagic, all\\n      have their important significance.\\n      \\n Anstie and Wagner, from clinical and\\n      microscopical work, have found that these false membranes develop more\\n      freely at first when the opposing surfaces are kept apart by the effused\\n      liquids. The running of the two pleurae together seem to impede the\\n      process of organization.\\n      \\n Wagner betones the fact that these\\n      newly-organized and vascular tissues often become the starting-points of\\n      fresh inflammatory processes and of new products.\\n      \\n\\n      \\n The question, then, now which presents\\n      itself to us, after digesting the foregoing opinions of the most reliable\\n      authors upon the constant tendency for pleuritis with effusion to leave\\n      the lung damaged, is, whether we should be satisfied with remedial\\n      measures until the patient is nearly in extremis, or shall we, by a timely\\n      and simple operative procedure, speedily restore our patient to perfect\\n      health by removing in exudation which is seldom able to leave the organ as\\n      it found it.\\n      \\n Professor Nothnagel tells us that\\n      \"a cure consists in so modifying pathological processes-be they\\n      chemical or physical, functional or dynamic-as not only to arrest them,\\n      but to restore to a state of physiological and anatomical integrity the\\n      organs and tissues that have been deranged. The cure (sometimes) can only\\n      take place through vital organic processes, and to medicine belongs the\\n      task of determining what outside support can be rendered to the vis\\n      medicatrix naturae.\".\\n      \\n The large majority of physicians and\\n      surgeons are opposed to operations in pleuritis with effusion during its\\n      acme and feverish state. If the orthopnoea becomes intense, the effusion\\n      increases rapidly, etc., they may become convinced of the necessity of an\\n      immediate relief through aspiration or incision.\\n      \\n In times I feel assured that all\\n      pleurisies will be treated by operation where an effusion exists.\\n      \\n The eminent authority on this subject,\\n      Dr. Bowditch, of Boston, lays down the rule that if the dyspnoea is\\n      excessive, so as to amount to permanent orthopnoea, or if I learn that\\n      within a few hours previous to my visit there has been even one attack of\\n      momentary orthopnoea, during which the patient felt the breath would be\\n      wholly lost, I tap immediately, provided I am sure that there is even a\\n      quantity of fluid in the pleural cavity, and that it is, apparently, the\\n      chief, or perhaps only, cases of the orthopnoea. \"I fear,\" he\\n      adds, \"death may occur before my next visit.\" He states, further\\n      on, that \"when a patient comes under notice in whom a large quantity\\n      of fluid has been long effused, I advise thoracocentesis as the first\\n      remedy.\" .\\n      \\n During the past year I have seen three\\n      cases of pleurisy die suddenly for the want of immediate evacuation of the\\n      pleural sac.\\n      \\n In such cases, even during the febrile\\n      stages, thoracocentesis seems to me the only remedy. Barnes says, \"It\\n      is my practice to operate at once when the chest is two parts filled with\\n      fluid, without waiting for urgent dyspnoea.\".\\n      \\n The propriety of operating in large\\n      effusions is being rapidly accepted by the profession generally, but there\\n      is considerable difference of opinion, even among enthusiasts for the\\n      operation, of the demand or advisability of interfering: 1st, during the\\n      febrile stage, and 2d, where moderate effusion remains unabsorbed. During\\n      the febrile stage it is maintained by many that the fluid would at once\\n      reform, and, furthermore, that the surgical treatment might excite\\n      additional inflammatory action. We have very strong evidence to prove that\\n      this is not correct.\\n      \\n For example, Castiaux (1873, These de\\n      Paris) chains that the operation by aspiration will hasten the cure of\\n      acute pleurisy and prevent the formation of the fibrinous deposits and\\n      bands which in nearly all cases, even in moderate effusion, impair the\\n      expansion of the lungs. He operated 37 cases, and cured them. The pulse\\n      and temperature fell within twenty-four hours of the operation, and the\\n      patients improved rapidly.\\n      \\n As soon as fluid was detected he\\n      operated by aspiration points, feeling that he had at his disposition sure\\n      means of relief which are harmless or nearly so, and that it is useless to\\n      leave this task to nature, which she so often cannot accomplish even in a\\n      half-way satisfactory manner. Medication is often untrustworthy in such\\n      conditions.\\n      \\n He operated at the height of the first\\n      or inflammatory stage.\\n      \\n In operating thus promptly the relieved\\n      the lung of compression, which must impair its expansion; he removed an\\n      effusion rich in fibrine and capable of increasing, in time, the thickness\\n      of the neo-membranes; he restored the power to the lung to dilate by\\n      removing this tendency to false membrane formation, which squeezes the\\n      lung tissue.\\n      \\n These membranes cannot become\\n      organized, as I have stated before, as long as they are separated by\\n      fluid.\\n      \\n He drew off all the fluid he could. The\\n      relief to the patient was often most marked. The lung expanded promptly\\n      and satisfactorily, as shown by auscultation. In a few cases the effusion\\n      returned, with an increased pulse and rise of temperature; another\\n      aspiration effectually arrested the process.\\n      \\n The cases treated in this fashion\\n      lasted a much shorter time, and apparently no false membrane supervened.\\n      \\n No accident occurred in any of his\\n      cases, and he never saw as a result of the operation the transformation of\\n      the serosity into pus.\\n      \\n We have nearly as strong testimony in\\n      some cases reported by Moutard-Martin. He operated in twelve cases, of\\n      about ten days\\' standing, with sero-fibrinous effusions, accompanied by\\n      fever. In eight there was no reproduction, in four it was very slight, and\\n      in none did it become purulent. On the other hand, in cases in existence\\n      from twenty to sixty days the fluid was always moderately reproduced.\\n      \\n He insists upon the prompt withdrawal\\n      of the fluid as the most successful method, more especially if we suspect\\n      the formation of false membranes.\\n      \\n Wedal\\'s results are even more\\n      remarkable than those of Castiaux or Moutard-Martin.\\n      \\n He considered puncture harmless during\\n      the acute stage, and claims it shows a hastening of the cure.\\n      \\n He operated seventeen times on\\n      seventeen patients form the second to the fifth day, and three times from\\n      the eighth to the tenth.\\n      \\n In acute cases, where the patients had\\n      no pulmonary or bronchial disease, the cure was not protracted beyond the\\n      twelfth day. Some were cured by the sixth. His clients were mostly young,\\n      vigorous men.\\n      \\n Dr. J. L. Mason tells us that in one\\n      hundred and thirty-two cases, where no operation was performed, the\\n      duration of the disease extended over weeks, and, in some cases, months.\\n      \\n What a comparison to draw between\\n      Castiaux, Widal, Moutard- Martin, and those cases of Mason.\\n      \\n Wedal thinks the earlier the operation\\n      is done, the more successful it is likely to be.\\n      \\n Dieulafoy thinks we should wait until\\n      the fever ceases.\\n      \\n According to Wilson Fox, the density of\\n      the adhesions and false membranes is determined within the first fortnight\\n      of the effusion.\\n      \\n As to the aetiology of pleurisy, we\\n      will content ourselves with making the inquiry: It is due to exposure,\\n      rheumatism, or tubercle? Dr. Lindsay found, in thirty-five cases, sixteen\\n      of them due to a wetting or exposure to cold while the patient was\\n      overheated. Rheumatism was present in three instances. In two cases there\\n      was a family history of tubercle, and in three haemoptysis of pulmonary\\n      origin. In ten cases, or nearly one- third, no cause could be found.\\n      Organic heart disease does not seem to induce pleurisy.\\n      \\n The relation of tuberculosis to acute\\n      pleurisy is the most important and difficult one.\\n      \\n Dr. Barrs, in a noteworthy article,\\n      shows that a very large number of cases of simple pleural effusion are\\n      really of tubercular origin.\\n      \\n He hunted up the after-history of\\n      seventy-four cases of simple pleural effusion, and found within five years\\n      thirty-two of these were dead, twenty-five were living, and seventeen\\n      could not be found. Of the thirty-two reported dead, fourteen died of\\n      phthisis, four died of other tubercular affections, and several of the\\n      others succumbed to some pulmonary affection.\\n      \\n Leaving out those who could not be\\n      traced in Dr. Barrs\\'s report, we have the astounding fact that more than\\n      one-half, apparently recovering from a simple pleural effusion, died\\n      within five years, and these mainly of some tuberculous affection.\\n      \\n It seems but a fair inference that if\\n      these statements are correct and are fairly typical and should be\\n      corroborated by others and by wider knowledge and experience, that the\\n      ultimate prognosis in simple pleural effusion, so far from being, as it is\\n      now commonly regarded, as distinctly favorable, would become most grave.\\n      \\n In Dr. Lindsay\\'s 35 cases only two\\n      instances of a family history of tubercle existed and only three instance\\n      of pulmonary haemorrhage. In others the presence of tubercle was\\n      suspected, but was not absolutely proven.\\n      \\n The association of pleurisy and\\n      tubercle is, therefore. more common than we are in the habit of believing.\\n      \\n The question raised by Dr. Barrs is one\\n      of the most important in medicine, and each one of us should sift it to\\n      the bottom.\\n      \\n If, then, a patient who has had an\\n      attack of acute pleurisy subsequently develops tuberculosis, the question\\n      arises whether the pleurisy was originally of tubercular origin or whether\\n      the damage suffered by the pleura and lung have not invited a tuberculosis\\n      which did not exist prior to the pleuritis.\\n      \\n I incline myself more strongly to the\\n      latter opinion.\\n      \\n The method of the treatment of the\\n      pleuritic effusion is here often the cause of the dire results we see\\n      following such processes.\\n      \\n All my practical knowledge of pulmonary\\n      phthisis inclines me to the belief that if a lung be left collapsed and\\n      inexpansile and bound down, as the result of pleural effusion, it is very\\n      likely to become the seat of tuberculosis, and that the development of\\n      tuberculosis under such circumstances is no proof that the underlying\\n      process was tubercular from the first.\\n      \\n I must further make the statement that\\n      in dealing with the great number of cases of pulmonary phthisis which come\\n      under my observation, I have been more and more impressed by the frequency\\n      with which pleurisy is found as an antecedent condition.\\n      \\n This is a fact which we cannot and\\n      should not ignore.\\n      \\n It is to be much regretted that we have\\n      no satisfactory records to show us what is the normal course of pleuritic\\n      effusions-moderate and large-without treatment. The tendency is probably\\n      to a spontaneous subsidence-quoad the effusion per se- and the great\\n      practical question is whether, by the administration of drugs or operative\\n      interference, we can materially hasten the cure. It is now generally\\n      admitted that many of the methods of elimination formerly in vogue by the\\n      Old School are either useless or injurious.\\n      \\n The testimony of those employing early\\n      puncture or advocating early operation gives a far different note of hope\\n      to the aggressive element in the profession.\\n      \\n The great question, then, for us in\\n      this connection to settle is, not whether aspiration should be performed,\\n      but how soon must it be done?.\\n      \\n In certain cases where the effusion is\\n      large and the dulness ascends as high as the second rib in front, or if\\n      the measurement of the affected side be markedly increased, much dyspnoea,\\n      etc., the advantage of aspiration cannot for a moment be disputed.\\n      \\n I maintain that we should not allow our\\n      patient to come to such a pass.\\n      \\n Those cases which present the most\\n      difficulty of decision are where we have a moderate effusion with or\\n      without fever and with or without dyspnoea or other disturbing symptoms.\\n      In such cases the inquiries arise: 1. Does aspiration lessen the chance of\\n      a speedy or remote fatal issue? and 2. Does aspiration shorten the\\n      duration of the disease, with the immediate prospects of restoring the\\n      affected parts to a condition of perfect physiological action?.\\n      \\n The first question may be somewhat\\n      summarily dismissed as to a sudden fatal issue where the effusion is\\n      moderate, but as to a remote fatal issue, where the accumulation has been\\n      in existence some time, our judgment must be reserved.\\n      \\n The second inquiry is a very\\n      interesting one, but the difficulty of absolutely determining it is very\\n      great.\\n      \\n It seems to me that the duration of the\\n      malady, in answering the second query, must first be taken into\\n      consideration.\\n      \\n In cases of several weeks\\' standing I\\n      believe the lung-and ergo its pleural surface-never returns to a healthy\\n      condition.\\n      \\n We must take cognizance, though, in\\n      this discussion, of the literature dealing with it. It must shape the\\n      judgment of the inexperienced and give a strong support to the man of\\n      large experience either pro or con.\\n      \\n One practitioner inclines to tap early\\n      in all cases, and to repeat it, if necessary, and his statistics will show\\n      the greatest number of recoveries and the shortest duration of illness.\\n      His remote results will be the most satisfactory fro a medical, surgical\\n      and prognostic point of view.\\n      \\n Another practitioner reserves operation\\n      for serious cases with large effusions, or for chronic or semi-chronic\\n      cases. His remote results will be the most unsatisfactory from a medical,\\n      surgical and prognostic point of view.\\n      \\n In empyema most writers agree that\\n      aspiration is not the method to employ, but that free incision, with\\n      drainage, is the recognized operation in American and the results quoad\\n      vitam are most gratifying.\\n      \\n In children we should note the marked\\n      tendency for pleuritic effusions to becomes purulent.\\n      \\n As a summary we would state:.\\n      \\n I. That aspiration carried out\\n      antiseptically in any stage of pleuritic effusion is not a dangerous\\n      procedure.\\n      \\n II. More people die from a postponed\\n      aspiration than from any operative interference.\\n      \\n III. Anstie and Weber have shown that\\n      organization of the fibrinous portion of the effusion can proceed very\\n      slowly and imperfectly when the two pleural surfaces are allowed to play\\n      on each other. Effusion separating the two surfaces hastens the formation\\n      of neo-membranes.\\n      \\n IV. Aspiration shortens the illness to\\n      fourteen or eighteen days.\\n      \\n V. Pleuritis without operation and with\\n      moderate effusion lasts seldom shorter than three weeks, and from that up\\n      to two months.\\n      \\n VI. With aspiration, the lung pleurae\\n      in very recent cases return to a physiological state.\\n      \\n VII. In semi-chronic, chronic and\\n      purulent effusions portions of the pleura and lung are permanently damaged\\n      and lead to one form, perhaps the most frequent, of phthisis.\\n      \\n VIII. Early aspiration is growing in\\n      favor, and I have witnessed several brilliant cures in my own practice and\\n      that of others.\\n      \\n IX. In three cases of large effusion\\n      seen in consultation, the operation being postponed until the following\\n      day, the patient has expired suddenly in the night.\\n      \\n DISCUSSION.\\n      \\n OSCAR LESEURE, M.D.: I am heartily in\\n      sympathy with the principles advanced in Dr. Schley\\'s paper, and will\\n      refer to them specially from the surgical standpoint.\\n      \\n I have failed to find an authority who\\n      does not admit the fact that the sooner a lung oppressed by pleuritic\\n      effusion is relieved from compression, the more completely will that lung\\n      be restored to its normal anatomical and physiological condition.\\n      \\n The opposition to early, or any,\\n      operation for the relief of pleuritic effusions (and in this sense I refer\\n      to serous or sero- fibrinous effusion and the operation of aspiration) is\\n      based mainly upon the accidents which have accompanied or immediately\\n      followed the operation, and which have very unjustly, in many instances,\\n      been attributed to it, or on the accidents which might theoretically\\n      complicate the process.\\n      \\n It is true that the mortality\\n      accompanying the early history of thoracocentesis was discouraging. Boyer\\n      and Gendrin lost 100 per cent.; Dupuytren, 96 per cent.; Davis, 33 per\\n      cent. (Donaldson). But from the time when Trousseau urged and practiced\\n      thoracocentesis with the trocar of Reybard, and Bowditch first used the\\n      method of aspiration, down to the present day, the statistics of the\\n      operation have so improved that Matas, in 1892, records over one thousand\\n      cases without a death.\\n      \\n Of the more important accidents\\n      attributed to the operation, we may enumerate the following: Injury to the\\n      intercostal vessels and nerves; injury of the liver, peritoneum, heart, or\\n      lungs; syncope; cerebral accidents, as paralysis and convulsions; cough\\n      and albuminous expectoration; purulent transformation.\\n      \\n We many dismiss the question of injury\\n      to the intercostal vessels and nerves by saying that, given a knowledge of\\n      their location, the average intercostal space, a proper instrument and\\n      reasonable skill, the objection should have no weight.\\n      \\n Injury to the liver, peritoneum, heart,\\n      or lungs we cannot dismiss so lightly, for, with the distinguished names\\n      of Aran and Claude Bernardo associated with these accidents, we must admit\\n      their importance. Still, with the advanced knowledge and improved methods\\n      of to-day; with the results of experience in selecting the point of\\n      puncture; also the proof from the statistics just quoted, we may consider\\n      the importance of this objection to be in its warning to the operator.\\n      \\n Of four cases of syncope occurring at\\n      the time or immediately following the operation, analyzed by Vergely,\\n      Guyot, Chaillou, and Besnier, one was due to heart clot, one to pulmonary\\n      embolus, one to phlebitis and thrombosis, and one to pulmonary gangrene.\\n      Bowditch and Donaldson have also attributed the accident to the\\n      complications existing at the time of the operation.\\n      \\n This accident might be due, also, to a\\n      too rapid evacuation of the fluid, thus suddenly depleting the cerebral\\n      vessels. A skilful operation will, therefore, remove the only just part of\\n      this objection.\\n      \\n Cerebral accidents are: paralysis, due\\n      to an embolus not directly traceable to the operation, or convulsions\\n      possibly due to a disturbed intracranial pressure, in turn attributable to\\n      a too rapid or complete evacuation of the effused fluid.\\n      \\n Cough, with albuminous expectoration,\\n      due to acute oedema of the lung, is justly charged to the operation, but\\n      is a dangerous condition only when the operator rashly disregards the\\n      warning which is given him, and which was so clearly described in the\\n      interesting paper presented to you by Prof. Biggar on Wednesday evening. I\\n      refer to the irritating cough, sometimes accompanied by dyspnoea, which\\n      may occur during the evacuation of the fluid. That it is an acute oedema\\n      of the pulmonary tissue has been demonstrated by Herard, Dieulafoy,\\n      Lavaran, Tissier, Moutard- Martin, Dujardin-Beaumetz, and others, and by\\n      them ascribed to a too rapid removal of the intra-pleural fluid, which, in\\n      turn, produces an extensive congestion of the lung suddenly freed from\\n      pressure.\\n      \\n Purulent transformation of the fluid\\n      remaining after aspiration is the objections most strenuously advanced by\\n      surgeons who oppose the operation. Late microscopical and bacteriological\\n      researches promise to prove the predictions of Fraenkel and Netter to be\\n      well founded, viz., that an early examination of the fluid effused will\\n      determine whether it is to remain a serous fluid or whether it is to\\n      become a purulent fluid.\\n      \\n The observations of Dieulafoy allow him\\n      to state that when the fluid contains five thousand (5000) or more red\\n      blood globules to the cubic millimeter, empyema will be the result. More\\n      important, and later, are the researches of Baviere, who has demonstrated\\n      the presence of the streptococcus in a certain number of cases, the\\n      pneumococcus in others, and the bacillus tuberculosis of Koch in others.\\n      In the majority of cases he found no bacilli. His conclusions, based on a\\n      large number of cases, are as follows:.\\n      \\n 1. Early aspiration.\\n      \\n 2. If the pneumococcus or bacillus of\\n      Koch is found, the puncture is to be repeated if the fluid persists or\\n      increases.\\n      \\n 3. If the streptococcus is found,\\n      resort at once to pleurotomy.\\n      \\n Briefly, as to the technique of the\\n      operation already described in our presence by Prof. Biggar:.\\n      \\n The weight of opinion is in favor of\\n      the sixth intercostal space in the middle axillary line as the point for\\n      puncture.\\n      \\n The instrument, in aspirator, with the\\n      special trocar of Potain or Frantzed to avoid wounding the lung.\\n      \\n Use absolute asepsis. Withdraw the\\n      fluid very slowly. Do not withdraw more than a quart at one operation.\\n      Stop the moment the patient complains of pain, or enough or dyspnoea\\n      appear.\\n      \\n JOHN W.D. DOWLING, M.D.: After reading\\n      Dr. Schley\\'s able argument in favor of early operation in cases of\\n      pleurisy with effusion, it is difficult to open the discussion when one is\\n      in almost complete accord with the views expressed. I have seen too much\\n      of the ill effects following delay in these cases, the delay in some cases\\n      being due to timidity and in other cases to failure to recognize the\\n      actual conditions present. The disadvantages of delay are many, and by far\\n      the most important at these, to my mind, is the fact that every day\\'s\\n      persistence of the fluid in the pleural cavity adds to the chance of that\\n      fluid becoming purulent, thus creating an empyema out of a simple serous\\n      effusion, or sero-fibrinous perhaps more frequently than simple serous.\\n      Every one admits that an empyema is a more grave condition, and it seems\\n      negligent to fail to resort to operative measures early, the result being\\n      the not unlikely development of the more serious condition, with its\\n      consequent dangers to the life of the patient.\\n      \\n As your speaker has said, many are not\\n      in favor of operation when moderate effusion remains unabsorbed. It seems\\n      clear, that if the consequences of the prolonged presence of this fluid\\n      were properly considered, the number of those who hold this opinion would\\n      be materially diminished. The presence in the pleural cavity of even a\\n      moderate amount of serous fluid necessitates the compression of part of\\n      the lung on the affected side, with a retraction of the lung as well. By\\n      this compression, air cells are obliterated entirely and portions of the\\n      lungs rendered almost impervious to the entrance of air further than the\\n      bronchi and larger bronchioles. The circulation is interfered with and\\n      slowed. From what we know of the conditions favorable to the development\\n      of tubercular processes in the lung, we see that the conditions required\\n      are thus produced, and though the effusion may eventually be absorbed, the\\n      chances are, that more serious trouble of the nature to will have had an\\n      opportunity to develop. Even failing this, the lung thus for a long time\\n      unable to expand will refuse to do so when the opportunity does come, and\\n      there will be a permanent coupling of the lung, and not uncommonly a\\n      visible deformity of the chest as well. The shorter the time the lung has\\n      been compressed the more as well. The shorter the time the lung has been\\n      compressed the more readily then will it expand if the compression be\\n      removed, and the earlier the operation is performed, even though\\n      necessarily repeated, the greater chance will there be of restoration in\\n      perfect function.\\n      \\n I would differ with Dr. Schley in his\\n      statement that the operative procedure will speedily restore our patient\\n      to perfect health. It is too sweeping a generalization. Many times early\\n      removal of the fluid will do this, but in my experience cases not\\n      infrequently arise where the removal must be repeated, not once only but\\n      several times, the disease lasting over a considerable period. I agree\\n      with the practice of early operation, but am not so sanguine as to its\\n      inevitable, favorable and speedy cure. Occasional and experience has\\n      taught me this.\\n      \\n The presence or absence of orthopnoea I\\n      do not consider a reliable indicator by itself for operation or delay. In\\n      many cases the accumulation has been so gradual that a considerable degree\\n      of toleration is attained, the patient being able to lie down without\\n      distress, and even to endure moderately gentle exercise without extreme\\n      dyspnoea. If orthopnoea be present, operate at once, but if it be absent,\\n      try to see if you cannot find other indications for operating, and if you\\n      cannot, operate, anyway, and I believe your results will give you reasons\\n      for early operation in succeeding cases.\\n      \\n As to whether the operation should be\\n      that of aspiration or free incision should be determined by the character\\n      of the fluid. If serous of even sero-fibrinous, aspiration would be\\n      indicated. But if purulent, particularly i children, the recovery of a\\n      number of cases after free incision has been performed, the immediate\\n      improvement consequent upon the complete removal of the pus, an\\n      impossibility where aspiration is resorted to, and the case with which\\n      further accumulation is prevented by the establishment of free drainage,\\n      all speak loudly in favor of this method, and in these cases it would seem\\n      to be almost certainly indicated.\\n      \\n A.A. WHIPPLE, M.D.: I want to agree in\\n      the main with all that has been said in the first paper and in the\\n      discussion. I would like to state a case that happened to me three or four\\n      years ago which I left in other care during a brief absence. When I\\n      returned I found the boy just ready to die. He was fourteen years of age.\\n      The father and three or four brothers or sisters died of consumption and\\n      some two or three of his uncles and aunts. He had hectic fever, high\\n      temperature, and all the symptoms pointing to empyema. Without any\\n      hesitation I made a free incision between the fifth and sixth ribs,\\n      removed three quarts of offensive matter, put in a drain-age-tube and\\n      syringed as thoroughly as possible, and followed that up for a few days,\\n      morning and evening. The temperature came down considerably, but the case\\n      not being satisfactory I put him under chloroform and made another\\n      incision between the eighth and ninth rib, put in another drainage-tube,\\n      and followed that with free syringing, using peroxide of hydrogen. I used\\n      it frequently, throwing it in at the upper tube and letting it run out of\\n      the lower. He made a good recovery, and in a not very long time. But the\\n      fact was it ought to have been operated earlier. It was on account of my\\n      absence from home that this was not done. In several instances I have\\n      operated early and have always found it best.\\n      \\n W.H. BURT, M.D.: It seems applicable,\\n      while on this subject, that I should show you a new instrument that I have\\n      just devised for examination of the lungs. Heretofore our instruments have\\n      been made principally of rubber, and rubber is a very poor conductor of\\n      sound. I have devised an instrument made wholly of metal, and with the use\\n      of the ball and socket joint we get every motion we want, and I am pleased\\n      to state that it carries the sound ten-fold better than any other device\\n      up to date. I simply want to exhibit it to the members of the Society at\\n      this time. The paper that has been read here I can heartily endorse.\\n      \\n E.R. EGGLESTON. M.D.: It seems, ladies\\n      and gentlemen, that I am to take up the unpopular side of this question.\\n      Is pleurisy to be treated by surgical means exclusively?.\\n      \\n That is the question I would like to\\n      have answered. So far neither in the papers nor in the discussions has a\\n      single word been said about the Homoeopathic remedy. I claim this: that\\n      under the proper use of the proper remedy administered at the proper time\\n      and place and under the proper conditions the trocar becomes obsolete. So\\n      much for that.\\n      \\n Now, I take exception to the philosophy\\n      of the paper. Let us see. An inflammation has been set up in the cavity.\\n      Nature, for the express purpose of keeping the surfaces of that cavity\\n      apart, has filled it more or less completely with fluid. These gentlemen\\n      propose to withdraw that fluid and hinder the operations of nature, let\\n      those surfaces come together and become adherent. That is why we get so\\n      many cases of fibroid phthisis in the hospitals and so few of them in\\n      private practice.\\n      \\n Do they do it in fractures? Isn\\'t the\\n      process precisely the same under different conditions? Here is a broken\\n      bone, and what does nature do? Throws out a provisional callus to protect\\n      the fractured ends of the bone. In pleurisy, nature throws out a\\n      provisional fluid to keep the surfaces apart. The cases are precisely\\n      analogous. Do they open the location of the fractured bone and take out\\n      this bony deposit? Why, no; they encourage it. What does nature do with\\n      the excess? Absorbs it, just exactly as it does in pleurisy. Nature takes\\n      care of its own deposits.\\n      \\n The only experience given us, so far as\\n      I heard, was that of the Old School. Is there any other? I have my own\\n      experience, and I have heard the experience of many others. Now what is\\n      it? That at the onset of this inflammatory action, just as in the onset of\\n      every other inflammatory action, there is irritation, hyperaemia,\\n      exudation always. Well, now what are the remedies that control all these\\n      processes? First, Aconite. Aconite controls the irritative stage on a\\n      philosophical and physiological basis. As soon as the irritative stage has\\n      passed, Bryonia controls the exudation stage on philosophical and\\n      physiological grounds, and it will do it, other things being equal, every\\n      time.\\n      \\n J. MONTFORT SCHLEY, M.D.: I think Dr.\\n      Eggleston\\'s remarks are such as no one will take exception to. he has\\n      stated his case very well, but we had nothing to do with the medical side\\n      of the case at all. I have seen, within the last sixteen months, nearly\\n      fifty cases of pleurisy with effusion. Perhaps I have been peculiarly\\n      fortunate. In most of them I was in consultation, and for the doctor\\'s\\n      special benefit I wish to emphasize his points. I am just as good a\\n      Homoeopath as he is. For his especial benefit I will say that every one of\\n      these I operated upon had been attended by the best Homoeopathic\\n      physicians in New York and vicinity. They had received Aconite, they had\\n      received Bryonia and everything else-opiates and Iodine-and that is all\\n      the good that it did them.\\n      \\n Now, there are two sides to these\\n      things and to these cases. If they had come from the Old School, I would\\n      put them in their proper place; but not one of them had been treated by an\\n      Allopathist, because I don\\'t consult with them if I can help it. Some of\\n      them were treated by men whom you have applauded on this platform-men who\\n      have come from New York, and who cannot be beaten as far as a Homoeopathic\\n      prescription is concerned.\\n      \\n I repeat, I believe in a large majority\\n      of cases that the Homoeopathic remedies have a wonderful and decided\\n      influence upon pleuritic effusions, but sometimes they seem to utterly\\n      fail. Whether it is a predisposition of the patient, whether it is a\\n      peculiar condition of the atmosphere, or whether it is the peculiar stage,\\n      of the virulent inflammation that takes place, I am unable to say.\\n      \\n When the doctor comes to talk about\\n      fibroid phthisis, I want to remind him that ours were cases that never had\\n      been operated on for fibroid phthisis. If the doctor had seen the\\n      post-mortems that I have had in the Vienna hospital, he would know that\\n      the majority had never seen a physician. With the pleura as thick as that\\n      (indicating), and the trouble entirely on one side of the lung, it seems\\n      to me that it is plain that the trouble has arisen from pleuritis, and not\\n      from a tuberculosed condition. I wrote this paper mainly not because I am\\n      afraid to go to the Old School-for we have got plenty of good Homoeopathic\\n      physicians in New York who have a great deal of experience-but it is the\\n      dread and disgust that a homoeopathic physician, and particularly a good\\n      Homoeopathic physician, has against surgery. He prescribes nothing else\\n      but Homoeopathic remedies, and he hates to have his patient put under the\\n      knife, and will fight it off until the last minute. That thing is done, in\\n      my opinion and experience, repeatedly. he thinks that his remedies will\\n      relieve these conditions; but how can they do it when you have the lungs\\n      squeezed down to the size of your fist and an enormous pleural mass there,\\n      and the pleura so thick i cannot absorb anything at all?.\\n      \\n Another thing is, follow up these\\n      cases, and see whether they develop fibroid phthisis after an early\\n      operation. I have had a good many under my care when I had the privilege\\n      of being their family physician, and have followed them for years, and you\\n      can scarcely detect a trace of adhesion of the pleura, and the scar has\\n      nearly all disappeared. In my experience, it is these very cases (whether\\n      it be a thickened pleura or a serous effusion) where we are more likely to\\n      get fibroid phthisis and curvature of the spine-the cases where nature\\n      cannot help herself nor do herself justice as the usually does.', u'Tresorie - PROPHYLAXIS OF CHOLERA [Prophylaxis Of Cholera]\\n\\n THE prevention treatment of diseases is\\n      of supreme importance not only to the physicians but to the whole world.\\n      We all knew the great boon which Jenner\\'s discovery of vaccination has\\n      conferred on the world at large. Vaccination, properly speaking, is a true\\n      Homoeo-prophylactic. The ill effects of vaccination are solely due to its\\n      abuse. Prophylactic treatment of small-pox was long in vogue in India, and\\n      the system is known as inoculation. That inoculation is a surer\\n      prophylaxis than vaccination is beyond all doubt and cavil. There is,\\n      however, one recommendation for vaccination, and the relative advantages\\n      and disadvantages of inoculation and vaccination, though it is a fact\\n      established beyond doubt that inoculation, although certain in its action,\\n      is dangerous in application, and had therefore to give way to the less\\n      dangerous method of vaccination.\\n      \\n Seven years ago Dr. Ferran, of Spain\\n      extensively tried his new method of inoculation of \"cholera\\n      virus.\" It is not yet known to the profession what \"cholera\\n      virus.\" is, and what was his method of inoculation. When, in 1885,\\n      cholera was devastating Southern Europe-more specially France, Spain, and\\n      Italy-Dr. Ferran astounded the world by his extravagant and bold assertion\\n      that of sixteen hundred inoculations there occurred not a single case of\\n      cholera. Physicians from neighboring countries at once repaired to Spain\\n      to see for themselves the astounding result of \"Ferranization,\"\\n      as well as to learn the method of Ferran\\'s inoculations.\\n      \\n The Madrid Academy of Medicine, on\\n      investigation, found \"Ferranization\" useless, and publicly\\n      declared it to be so. German and French physicians returned to their\\n      respective countries well satisfied that \"Ferranization\" was\\n      nothing but a snare and delusion.\\n      \\n Now comes the question, whether it is\\n      even possible to prevent cholera by inoculation? This question cannot,\\n      indeed, be answered satisfactorily in the present state of our knowledge.\\n      The specific \"cholera virus\" has not yet been discovered and\\n      demonstrated. I assert this in spite of Dr. Koch\\'s so-called discovery of\\n      comma-shaped \"cholera bacillus\" as the true \\'cholera\\n      virus.\" Dr. Koch\\'s comma-shaped bacillus has been found and\\n      demonstrated long ago in aphthous sore mouth and in persons suffering from\\n      dysentery by Drs. Lewis and Cunningham. Drs. Klein and Heneage Gibbs also\\n      proved the innocuousness of Koch\\'s comma- shaped bacillus by drinking a\\n      whole lot of these bacilli, cultivated according to Koch\\'s method, with\\n      impunity. Nor could Klein and Heneage Gibbs produce cholera in pigs and\\n      other animals by injecting the cultivated bacilli. Though Klein escaped\\n      from an attack of cholera by swallowing these bacilli, I must admit that\\n      this cannot be an argument against the non-specificity of these bacilli,\\n      for we all know that every one exposed to small-pox or any other\\n      infections disease, it requires a peculiar state of the system; or, in\\n      other words, specific virus of infections diseases is capable of infecting\\n      a person when it gets, as it were, a suitable nidus for propagation.\\n      \\n Very lately Pettenkofer largely\\n      experimented with the specific cholera bacilli. In all cases he failed to\\n      produce cholera in those with whom he experimented. He at last, on several\\n      different occasions, experimented on himself. Once or twice diarrhoeic\\n      stools were produced only. But on all occasions the stools were found\\n      swarming with the so called specific bacilli of cholera. Pettenkofer thus\\n      satisfactorily proved that these bacilli were not either the remote or\\n      proximate cause of cholera.\\n      \\n Prevention of cholera by inoculation,\\n      therefore, must be ineffectual so long as we are unable to discover and\\n      isolate beyond doubt the specific virus of cholera. Besides, if cholera be\\n      avoided by inoculation of cholera virus, I would call this method\\n      Iso-prophylaxis, and not Homoeo-prophylaxis.\\n      \\n Vaccination is a true\\n      Homoeo-prophylaxis. It is efficacious in preventing spread of small-pox\\n      those who are protected by its inoculation. Dr. Burnett admits this, but\\n      he at the same time raises questions which are, to my mind, very\\n      pertinent.\\n      \\n He says that vaccination has been able\\n      to protect some, but it has not been able either to decrease the mortality\\n      and morbidity of those who are attacked with the pox. It has, on the other\\n      hand, increased the morbidity, i.e., proneness to get diseases. Dr.\\n      Burnett\\'s statements require further verification.\\n      \\n If Homoeo-prophylaxis by inoculation\\n      increases the morbidity of the system, it would then be useless to adopt\\n      it. It has, however, been abundantly proved that Iso-prophylaxis, such as\\n      inoculation of small-pox and hydrophobic virus, has proved dangerous to\\n      human life. The celebrated French savant, M. Pasteur, has been trying,\\n      with the countenance of the medical profession of the world, inoculation\\n      of hydrophobic virus in cases of hydrophobia, with doubtful results well\\n      known to you all.\\n      \\n It is my belief, based on the\\n      successful preventive treatment of small-pox by vaccination, that\\n      Homoeo-prophylaxis is a safe as well as successful method of treatment.\\n      \\n The question which now crops up is\\n      whether Homoeo- prophylaxis is possible and practicable by administering\\n      Homoeopathic medicines? Our great master, Hahnemann, himself suggested two\\n      such medicines prepared according to his own method. These two medicines\\n      were Cuprum metallicum and Veratrum album. Drs. Quin, Dudgeon, Josttein,\\n      Humphreys and others believe in the efficacy of these two medicinal\\n      substances prophylactics of cholera; whereas Drs. Hempel and Rutherford\\n      Russel deny their efficacy.\\n      \\n Hahnemann\\'s directions for the use of\\n      Cuprum was to take a small globule of the 30th potency of Cuprum or\\n      Veratrum once a week during an epidemic. The medicinal action should not\\n      be disturbed by dietetic irregularities and smell of Camphor. He also\\n      urged moderate diet and cleanliness.\\n      \\n Dr. Quin\\'s experience showed that these\\n      two substances preserved a good many persons from attacks of cholera. Dr.\\n      Humphreys says, \"It is the general experience of Homoeopathic\\n      physicians that among those who took the medicines (Cuprum and Veratrum),\\n      and were attacked with the disease, it showed itself in its mildest form,\\n      while those who had omitted this preventive treatment were attacked with\\n      great violence.\\n      \\n Dr. Constantine Hering says that\\n      \"the surest preventive against cholera is Sulphur. Put half a\\n      teaspoonful of flowers of Sulphur into each of your stockings, and go\\n      about your business. never go out with an empty stomach; eat no fresh\\n      bread nor sour food. This is not only a preventive in cholera, but also in\\n      many other diseases. Not one of the many thousands who have followed this,\\n      my advice, has been attacked by cholera.\"\\n      \\n Dr. Dudgeon says: \"It would be\\n      wrong to neglect the means which the genius of Hahnemann and the labors of\\n      his disciples have put within our reach, when the means are so simple and\\n      efficacious, whilst the cure is so difficult hazardous\".\\n      \\n Some physicians of the Orthodox School\\n      recommend an ounce of brandy two or three times a day after meals, as a\\n      preventive against cholera. Others of the same school urge the use of\\n      dilute sulphuric acid, ten to fifteen drops every day in empty stomach, as\\n      the surest preventive of cholera.\\n      \\n I have thus quoted many highest\\n      authorities in our school about the prophylaxis of cholera. All those whom\\n      I have quoted are only partially right. I have put Cuprum, Veratrum,\\n      Sulphur, Camphor, etc., to the crucible of practical test, with results\\n      neither positive nor negative.\\n      \\n As India is the home of cholera, so I\\n      have had immense opportunities to try these prophylactics repeatedly. I\\n      had sometimes success, other times failures. At last I found that of all\\n      physicians Dr.Dudgeon struck the right key-note regarding the use of these\\n      prophylactics. He truly says \"that prophylactics that were useful in\\n      the previous epidemics might not prove equally useful in the next\\n      Consequently we can determine upon a prophylactic only when we know the\\n      actual character of the epidemic the same rule guiding us in the selection\\n      of preventive as in the choice of a remedy viz, a comparison of the\\n      symptoms of the disease, with the physiological effects of the\\n      remedies\".\\n      \\n This is is the right explanation of\\n      failures and successes of prophylactic. We must study the genus epidemics\\n      before we can hit upon a prophylactic. All cholera epidemics are not of\\n      the same character, neither do all cholera cases present similar symptoms.\\n      As there cannot be any specific medicine for any disease, so there can\\n      never be any one single prophylactic medicine for any disease. Many\\n      physicians, therefore, are mistaken in their notions about specific\\n      medicines, both curative and preventive, for diseases. Every one of us\\n      should bear in mind the sage advice of Dudgeon in the selection of\\n      prophylactics of cholera. I have had very satisfactory results since\\n      following Dudgeon\\'s advice. Those who have had experience of several\\n      cholera epidemics must have noticed that the type and character of all the\\n      epidemics are not the same throughout their course. My object in noticing\\n      this fact is, that with the change of type and character of the prevailing\\n      epidemic we must as well change our prophylactic medicines.\\n      \\n The object of prophylaxis is one of\\n      considerable moment both to physicians and the public, though it has not\\n      been hitherto worked out properly.\\n      \\n Dudgeon remarks \"if we can by\\n      means of the Homoeopathic principle discover preventives for such diseases\\n      as scarletina and cholera morbus, the discovery of medicinal preventives\\n      for other diseases of an equally fixed character seems to be feasible. As\\n      yet I cannot say that such preventives have been discovered, for it by no\\n      means supported by evidence.\".... \"The we shall ultimately\\n      succeed in discovering more prophylactics for fixed diseases I do not\\n      doubt. In the meantime it can be said that we have advanced in this\\n      direction beyond the point Hahnemann brought us to.\" Now, it cannot\\n      be gainsaid what Dudgeon asserts.\\n      \\n Is it not, therefore, our imperative\\n      duty to duty the epidemics of cholera more carefully, more scientifically\\n      and more patiently with the view of combating it more successfully?\\n      \"Prevention is better than cure\" is better applicable in this\\n      dire disease. As physicians trained in the school of Hahnemann, unfettered\\n      by any dogmas, and not bound down by any orthodox line of treatment, I\\n      think it should be our primary duty to study the Homoeo-prophylaxis of\\n      diseases, and more specially of cholera, which every now and again causes\\n      so much havoc, alarm and mischief.\\n      \\n To sum up:.\\n      \\n 1. Homoeo-prophylaxis is possible, as\\n      it has been proved abundantly in many cases.\\n      \\n 2. Before selecting any prophylactic\\n      medicines, we should study the genus epidemicus.\\n      \\n 3. As the type and character of the\\n      same epidemic very with its progress, so we shall not rest content with\\n      the same prophylactic medicine throughout its course, but change it with\\n      the change of the character and type of the epidemic.\\n      \\n 4. The action of prophylactic medicines\\n      should not be disturbed by irregularity of diet, smell of Camphor and\\n      insanitary surroundings.\\n      \\n 5. For the success of the prophylactic\\n      treatment, observance of general hygienic rules are absolutely necessary.\\n      \\n 6. The prophylactic medicines should be\\n      administered in as small a dose as possible, and should be repeated at\\n      longer intervals.', u'Tresorie - Roentgenometric Pelvimetry [Roentgenometric Pelvimetry]\\n CHARLES W.PERKINS, M.D.\\n      \\n Norwalk, Conn\\n      \\n FOR some time the x-ray has been used\\n      to advantage in diagnosis of multiple pregnancy, position of fetus and\\n      fetal abnormalities. However, it has been only the past four or five years\\n      that any definite information has been obtained by roentgenographic\\n      methods of diagnoses in pelvimetry.\\n      \\n At the present time we are convinced\\n      that only by means of roentgenographs can be true proportions of the\\n      superior strait be determined, and that the ordinary external methods of\\n      Pelvimetry are not only occasionally misleading but proportionately\\n      inaccurate.\\n      \\n The present communication deals with\\n      the method of Herbert Thomas of Yale University. This method was developed\\n      in cooperation with the late Dr. W.A. Lafield, who was Professor of\\n      Roentgenology at the Yale Medical School.\\n      \\n Some of the reasons why roentgen\\n      pelvimetry has not been more universally adopted are probably due to the\\n      following factors.\\n      \\n (1) The majority of women will be\\n      delivered normally, whether or not pelvic measurements are made.\\n      \\n (2) The medical profession does not\\n      readily accept a new method after an established satisfactory routine has\\n      been in use.\\n      \\n (3) A new method of diagnosis incurs\\n      added expense.\\n      \\n (4) The present methods, although\\n      entirely speculative, are satisfactory in most cases.\\n      \\n (5) Roentgen pelvimetry cannot be\\n      performed by the obstetrician himself but requires the aid of a\\n      roentgenologist.\\n      \\n (6) The value of roentgenometric\\n      diagnosis is recent in origin and as yet not universally accepted.\\n      \\n If the knowledge of the size and shape\\n      of the pelvis is necessary to the practice of obstetrics, roentgen\\n      pelvimetry is a sound procedure, particularly in pre-emptors patients, and\\n      should and should be considered as an indispensable aid in these cases.\\n      \\n The method of Herbert Thoms as\\n      developed at Yale Medical School is not the only method. However, it can\\n      be classified as simple, accurate and rapid; being adaptable for use by\\n      other than experts in x-ray and obstetric diagnosis. As a technical\\n      procedure a well trained hospital technician can master its technic alter\\n      sufficient instruction.\\n      \\n Studies of recent years reveal the fact\\n      that external Pelvimetry fails to give uniform and accurate information in\\n      regard to the shape and size of the superior strait. This is often true of\\n      thin undersized individuals. In many patients of this type external\\n      measurements may suggest a contracted pelvis while the x-ray will show a\\n      relatively large pelvis with a subsequent natural labor and normal-sized\\n      child. On the other hand a stocky short person with similar external\\n      measurements will disclose a contracted pelvis which is an obstetric\\n      problem. Because of the apparent relationship between shortening of the\\n      transverse diameter and a secondary persistent occipito-posterior\\n      presentation, accurate information regarding this diameter is of clinical\\n      significance.\\n      \\n The observations of Thomas were made on\\n      twenty consecutive patients whose pelvis showed a relative or real\\n      shortening of the transverse diameter of the superior strait. In every\\n      instance a primary or secondary occipito posterior position was found\\n      after the patient was in labor. (Herbert Thoms, Surgery, Gynecology and\\n      Obstetrics, January, 1933). It therefore has been proved that an actual or\\n      relative shortening of a transverse diameter of the superior strait\\n      results in a limitation of space that is greater in the anterior than in\\n      the posterior half of the superior strait. Under these circumstances, when\\n      the head descends early in labor, the occiput is forced to rotate\\n      posteriorly.\\n      \\n The x-ray offers additional information\\n      in determining the size of the fetal head. It has been noted in x-ray\\n      examination of the unengaged fetal head that it lay with the transverse\\n      diameter of the superior strait, the occiput being either to the right or\\n      left; therefore, if roentgenogram of the patient is taken in the supine\\n      position with the fetus in the uterus, it will cast a shadow which is an\\n      enlarged profile of the head. The measurements of the occipital frontal\\n      diameter of the head can then be made. On numerous occasions this method\\n      of cephalometry, determining the diameter of the unmoulded head before and\\n      after cesarean section, has yielded accurate results. (Thomas, A.M.A.,\\n      February 24, 1934).\\n      \\n As experience increases in roentgen\\n      pelvimetry, the so-called labor test will be employed less. This, however,\\n      does not mean that the physician should not under estimate the importance\\n      of uterine contraction and the ability of the fetal head to mold. It has\\n      always followed that when something could be proved desirable in medicine\\n      for the better protection of the patient, such an advance would be\\n      demanded and eventually become routine. We may concede, therefore, that\\n      roentgen pelvimetry has a distinct place in the examination of every\\n      primiparous woman. In many instances, according to Thomas and others,\\n      external; measurements were normal but the x-ray examination revealed a\\n      contracted pelvis. On the other had, in certain patients whose external\\n      measurements suggested a cesarean section roentgen pelvimetry proved\\n      otherwise and they were subsequently delivered in a normal manner.\\n      \\n CENTIMETER GRID METHOD.\\n      \\n The procedure in this method may be\\n      summarized by stating the following:.\\n      \\n (1) The patient is placed on the\\n      roentgenographic table in the semi- recumbent position.\\n      \\n (2) The level of the superior strait\\n      above the sensitized film is established.\\n      \\n (3) The tube target is centered about\\n      five centimeters posterior to the symphysis, at thirty-two inches from the\\n      sensitized film, The exposure is made.\\n      \\n (4) The patient is removed from the\\n      table, the tube target and sensitized film remaining in situ.\\n      \\n (5) A lead plate, or centimeter grid,\\n      with perforations exactly one centimeter apart, is introduced into the\\n      same plane as that previously occupied by the superior strait and a second\\n      (flash) exposure is made on the same sensitized film as was used used in\\n      the previous exposure.\\n      \\n (6) Development of the film shows the\\n      outline of the superior strait and the shadows of the perforations, the\\n      assistance between which represents centimeters in the plane of the\\n      superior strait. The anteroposterior and transverse diameters of the\\n      superior strait in its use proportions may be drawn on centimeter-square\\n      paper by following the course of the shadow of the superior strait and\\n      transcribing it.\\n      \\n As this time I wish to express my\\n      thanks to Dr. Thoms for his personal advice and instruction which helped\\n      me to master the technic of his method.', u'Tresorie - CHOLERA-ITS CURATIVE TREATMENT [Cholera & Treatment]\\n\\n FOR convenience of describing the\\n      medicine in the treatment of cholera it is usual with authors to divide\\n      the disease into various stages. It is not exactly true that these stages\\n      appear one after the other in regular succession as described in the\\n      books. O the contrary, we often find one stage merging into the preceding\\n      or succeeding stage. We cannot always expect to see the disease phenomena\\n      occur in regular successive order.\\n      \\n However, all writers on cholera agree\\n      in recognizing four stages of the disease: first, the premonitory stage,\\n      or, as it is sometimes called, an incubation; second, the stage of\\n      evacuation, or full development; third, collapse; and fourth, the stage of\\n      reaction. We shall describe the treatment in this successive order,\\n      reserving complications and sequels of the disease till the end.\\n      \\n The number of remedies in actual\\n      cholera is not very large. Hahnemann was the first to suggest Camphor,\\n      Veratrum and Cuprum, and this suggestion is so simple that there is no\\n      difficulty in treating the disease effectually.\\n      \\n In the premonitory stage we are not in\\n      a position to say that these symptoms would lead to such a serious disease\\n      as cholera, and so no particular medicine is prescribed or a physician\\'s\\n      help deemed necessary. If there is some diarrhoea, it can be easily\\n      checked by the timely administration of a few doses of Camphor or\\n      Phosphoric acid or Podophyllum. If the patient is complaining of malaise,\\n      pains in body and chilliness, we can give Aconite, and if there be no\\n      appetite and the bowels are irregular, regulation of diet and rest are all\\n      that is necessary. When purging and vomiting of \"rice-water\"\\n      takes place, or, in other words, when the second stage is fully\\n      established, no times should be lost in selecting and administering one of\\n      the following remedies, according to the state and symptomatic indications\\n      of the case.\\n      \\n Veratrum alb.\\n      \\n Camphor, Cuprum met, or acet, Ricinus,\\n      Jatropha, Euphorbia, Croton tig, Antim. tart. Elaterium.\\n      \\n Veratrum album may be considered as the\\n      type of a class of remedies which are more or less potent in checking\\n      undue evacuations and bringing them to a natural color and consistency. In\\n      fact, by their timely administration, any further mischief may be averted.\\n      In such cases of these medicines should be selected in accordance with the\\n      symptomatic manifestations of the case.\\n      \\n Veratrum album.-We are familiar with\\n      the fact that white Hellebore is a drastic purgative; so, according to the\\n      laws of Homoeopathy, it is a medicine per excellence for choleraic\\n      evacuations, both purging and vomiting. From our repeated personal\\n      experience we can give Veratrum the highest place in the developed stage\\n      of cholera. Our late lamented Professor Farrington says, \"Veratrum\\n      seems to act prominently on the abdominal organs, acting probably through\\n      the splanchnic nerves. When these nerves are paralyzed, the bloodvessels\\n      become overcharged with blood and pour forth their serum. The prostration,\\n      the coldness and the terrible sinking sensation that belong to Veratrum,\\n      all start from these nerves.\".\\n      \\n Indications for Administering\\n      Veratrum.-Vomiting and purging of a large quantity of serous\\n      fluid-rice-water evacuations, as they are called; colicky pains through\\n      the abdomen, with cramps in the extremities, especially the calves of the\\n      legs; great prostration; cold sweats, especially on the forehead; coldness\\n      and blueness of face and hands; great thirst for large quantities of cold\\n      water for acid drinks.\\n      \\n In times of cholera outbreaks it is\\n      wise to give Veratrum at the first appearance of diarrhoea, so that no\\n      further and serious development would take place. In such cases Veratrum\\n      has a marvelous effect. It is true that in Veratrum poisoning the stools\\n      are not always choleric; they are sometimes tinged with bile, and there is\\n      no total suppression of urine. Whatever maybe the toxicological effect of\\n      Veratrum about the evacuation, our clinical experience with this drug is\\n      very extensive. We can confidently give this medicine in all sorts of\\n      evacuation.\\n      \\n In cholera, general depression of\\n      strength is very great, and here Veratrum is also our sheet anchor.\\n      Hahnemann gives us the following picture of Veratrum poisoning in his\\n      Lesser Writings: \"two children took while Hellebore by mistake. A few\\n      minutes after taking the drug they became quite cold, fell down, their\\n      eyes projecting like those of a person in a state of suffocation, the\\n      saliva ran continually from their months, and they seemed devoid of\\n      consciousness. I saw them half an hour after the accident, and when I\\n      arrived both seemed at the point of death, distorted, projecting eyes,\\n      disfigured, cold countenance, relaxed muscles, closed jaws and\\n      imperceptible respiration\".\\n      \\n As regards dose, I generally commence\\n      with the 12x, and subsequently to the 30x. Our next great anti-choleric\\n      remedy is:.\\n      \\n Camphor.-It is generally used in the\\n      first state of diarrhoea, and also sometimes in the stage of collapse.\\n      Body is cold, voice husky, prostration very great. In times of outbreak as\\n      soon as a patient is passing diarrhoeic stools, no time should be lost in\\n      administering Camphor. At this time one to five drops of the Camphor\\n      solution after each stool is all that is required, and we are almost sure\\n      of checking the further progress of the disease. Hahnemann says: \"In\\n      the first stage Camphor gives rapid relief, but the patient\\'s friends must\\n      themselves employ it, as this stage soon ends in either death or in the\\n      second stage, which is more difficult to be cured, and not with Camphor.\\n      In the first stage accordingly the patient must get as often as possible\\n      (at least every five minutes) a drop of the spirit of Camphor (made with\\n      one ounce of Camphor to twelve of alcohol) on a lump of sugar or in a\\n      spoonful of water.\".\\n      \\n \"The quicker all this is done at\\n      the first onset of the first stage of the disease, the more rapidly and\\n      certainly will the patient recover; often in a couple of hours, warmth,\\n      strength, consciousness, rest and sleep return, and he is saved.\".\\n      \\n What Hahnemann said above I had several\\n      opportunities of witnessing in my own practice. In my younger days, when I\\n      was consulted in the beginning of an attack, I was almost invariably\\n      successful with Camphor alone, but later on I had scarcely a case when I\\n      had the opportunity of administering Camphor with success. Dr. Rubini, of\\n      Naples, was immensely successful with his preparation of Camphor (equal\\n      parts of Camphor and Alcohol), and I believe he treated his cases from the\\n      beginning with Camphor.\\n      \\n Cuprum.-This medicine may be used in\\n      all stages of cholera; especially it is very efficacious in the developed\\n      state of the disease. It has the power of checking purging and vomiting,\\n      and is preeminently useful in cutting short the distressing and painful\\n      cramps in various parts of the body. Hahnemann placed great reliance in\\n      this medicine. He sometimes advised us to give it in alternation with\\n      Veratrum. Our late lamented Dr. B.L. Bhaduri, who had treated more cases\\n      of cholera than anybody in India, used to say that he could treat nearly\\n      all his cases with Cuprum alone. He was very fond of Cuprum ars. in the\\n      stage of collapse with purging, vomiting and cramps. Drs. Drysdale and\\n      Russel spoke highly of it and so did Mr. Proctor. This latter gentleman\\n      treated ninety-eight cases of fully-developed cholera with this drug, and\\n      was satisfied with it. He writes: \"For the cramps it is\\n      unquestionably the best remedy, and I must say for the vomiting also. In\\n      the stage of collapse I gradually found myself trusting to Cuprum, and the\\n      impression is very strong in my mind that in collapse it is the most\\n      valuable of our remedies.\".\\n      \\n Indications for Cuprum.-Purging and\\n      vomiting up rice-water fluid; colic of a paroxysmal nature; constant\\n      restlessness; cramps in the extremities, beginning in fingers and toes;\\n      great exhaustion; icy coldness of hands and feet; quick, rattling and\\n      short breathing almost imperceptible, weak and thready pulse; pale and\\n      sunken features; great thirst, water runs down with a gurgling noise;\\n      relief of vomiting after drinking; scanty or entirely suppressed urine.\\n      \\n I prefer the higher dilutions, from\\n      12th and upwards. I have seen aggravation form the use lower dilutions in\\n      several cases.\\n      \\n Cuprum Arsen.-This combination of\\n      copper and arsenic is very efficacious in cholera. Dr. Hale first draws\\n      our attention to its use in cholera cases. He says, in his New Remedies,\\n      \"I first used it in some severe cases of cholera in the year 1867 and\\n      1876. These cases were marked by the usual intestinal disorder, to which\\n      were added severe and painful cramps in the abdomen and extremities. The\\n      alternation of Arsenic and Cuprum did not prove as satisfactory as I\\n      expected, but the use of Cuprum ars. in sixth trituration in water for\\n      children, and dry on the tongue in adults, generally acted promptly. I can\\n      recommend it in cholera infantum, spasmodic and neuralgic pains in the\\n      bowels, accompanied by screams, and cramps in the fingers and toes,\\n      attended with great debility and threatened collapse.\".\\n      \\n I can bear testimony to its efficacy in\\n      many serious cases of cholera.\\n      \\n Allied to Veratrum and Camphor are\\n      quite a large number of medicines more or less applicable to cholera\\n      evacuations, and these are Ricinus, Jatropha, Croton tig., Euphorbia and\\n      Elaterium. Among these we had a very satisfactory result from Ricinus in\\n      the epidemic of 1883. It is useful in cases of diarrhoeic cholera. We have\\n      numbers of cures reported in the India Homoeopathic Review of that year. I\\n      used it in diarrhoeic cases where the disease took its origin from\\n      indigestion or simple diarrhoea. In a big family in Calcutta there was an\\n      outbreak of cholera, and three persons died of it, though Homoeopathic\\n      treatment was had recourse to from the beginning. I was called when a\\n      fourth case appeared, and I at once hit upon Ricinus, which had a\\n      marvelous effect in restoring the patient to health. In the very house I\\n      had to treat four more cases, and all of them were saved by the timely\\n      administration of Ricinus. In this house there was a medical student, who\\n      asked me the name of the medicine, and learned that it was Ricinus. He\\n      remarked that in all pervious cases which died Veratrum, Camphor and other\\n      medicines were given. Ricinus surely is a new medicine. He gave the credit\\n      to Dr. George Johnson, who promulgated the Castor oil treatment of\\n      cholera.\\n      \\n Indications for Ricinus.-Purging and\\n      vomiting of rice-water fluid; cramps in the extremities; there was\\n      scarcely any pain in abdomen; extreme prostration; complete suppression of\\n      urine; pulse almost imperceptible; slight coldness of the hands and feet.\\n      \\n In Ricinus cases there is a gradual\\n      sinking of the vital power; in Veratrum and Camphor it takes place rather\\n      rapidly. The stools may be sometimes tinged with bile. If the disease\\n      takes its origin from transgression in food, Ricinus is so much more\\n      indicated. I am in the habit of using the 6x dilution, repeated after each\\n      stool.\\n      \\n Jatropha is sometimes efficacious. It\\n      produces depression of the heart; vomiting is more prominent than purging.\\n      \\n Jatropha.-Whitish vomiting, copious and\\n      like white of egg; stools in gushes, gurgling and rumbling in the bowels;\\n      cramps in the extremities; pains and burning in stomach; coldness of body;\\n      slight perspiration and thready pulse; \"watery diarrhoea, as if\\n      spurted from him.\" The very alarming symptoms are not marked in\\n      Jatropha, and the patient is devoid of any anxiety for his future, but is\\n      rather lively and cares nothing for his suffering and disease.\\n      \\n Euphorbia is another medicine closely\\n      allied to Jatropha. In fact, it is a remedy for simple choleric diarrhoea\\n      and not for cholera proper. Both Jatropha and Euphorbia I use in the 6x\\n      dilution after each stool.\\n      \\n Croton tig. is also a medicine for\\n      diarrhoea, but it often cuts short the disease, which may be developed\\n      into actual cholera. Stools are yellow, watery, passed forcibly like shot,\\n      worse after food and drink; there is deadly nausea; vomiting eczema,\\n      Croton is a good remedy; dilutions from 6x to 30 used.\\n      \\n Very closely related to Veratrum is\\n      Antimonium tart. Its indications are very much like those of Veratrum alb.\\n      Practically, when I find Veratrum fails I resort to Ant. tart. Purging of\\n      rice-water stools; vomiting with great effort; cold and clammy\\n      perspiration; drowsiness, with complete exhaustion; pulse almost\\n      imperceptible or nearly so; heart\\'s action failing; respiration labored\\n      and difficult. When there is an epidemic of small-pox prevailing, it is\\n      better to give Ant. tart. in the beginning of an attack of cholera, as it\\n      is alike efficacious in both diseases. We have seen it act beautifully.\\n      \\n These are the principle remedies in\\n      developed stages of cholera. They are more or less efficacious in checking\\n      the cholera evacuations, and thus bringing the case to safe and sound\\n      grounds.\\n      \\n In what is called English cholera, or\\n      cholera morbus, I found Iris versicolor or useful remedy. When vomiting is\\n      predominant and distressing, with acid rising, burning throughout the\\n      alimentary canal from mouth to anus, I frequently had to resort to it. In\\n      the case of a young gentleman in a suburban town of Calcutta, I got a\\n      charming effect from Iris. The attending physician there tried all cholera\\n      medicines to check purging and vomiting of bilious and acid matters, with\\n      burning in stomach, without any effect for two days. I gave him Iris vers.\\n      6x, and in a couple of hours he was almost cured.\\n      \\n Now, if the evacuations are not\\n      stopped, or case after a considerable damage to the constitution of our\\n      patient, the case goes on to the next stage. I mean the collapse stage. In\\n      this stage the patient is on the very verge of death. But, as Homoeopaths,\\n      we must not lose heart even in this stage. In this stage the patient is on\\n      the very verge of death. But, as Homoeopaths, we must not lose heart even\\n      in this stage. The following medicines are to be thought of now:\\n      \\n Arsenicum alb.\\n      \\n Aconite. Camphor. Carbo. veg. Cuprum\\n      acet. and Ars. Hydrocyanic acid and Cyanides. Cholera (Naja). Secale cor.\\n      Veratrum alb. Antim. tart.\\n      \\n Practically, a great deal of difficulty\\n      would arise in treating this stage of the disease. We have a great many\\n      medicines so closely analogous in their symptomatic indications that it is\\n      very hard to say which is most appropriate. However, if we can examine our\\n      patients more minutely, we can come to a definite selection.\\n      \\n Arsenicum album is the most important\\n      medicine in the collapse stage of cholera. its pathogenetic symptoms are\\n      so much like cholera symptoms that an arsenical poisoning case may be\\n      mistaken for a genuine cholera case. It has a vast range of action, and we\\n      have repeatedly verified its curative virtues in most serious cases of\\n      cholera. It is for this reason that I select it as a prototype of collapse\\n      remedies. Its symptoms are very marked and unmistakable. Great\\n      irritability, associated with profound exhaustion, is the prominent\\n      characteristic of Arsenic. You will see patients whose pulse is no longer\\n      perceptible; great weakness; even unable to utter a single word; yet so\\n      restless, irritable, and anxious that you will be surprised.\\n      \\n Indications for Arsenic; great anxiety\\n      and restlessness; fear of death; utter prostration of strength; sunken\\n      eyes; distorted face; pointed nose; cold and clammy perspiration over th\\n      whole body; burning of the whole body; unquenchable thirst and vomiting\\n      after drinking; drinks often but little at a time; violent burning of the\\n      stomach and abdomen; urine completely suppressed.\\n      \\n When cholera attacks come on after\\n      eating much unripe fruits, drinking much ice water, living in a damp place\\n      and exposed to a putrefactive and offensive smell of decaying animal and\\n      vegetable substances, Arsenic should be selected at once.\\n      \\n Lower dilutions of the medicine are not\\n      so efficacious as the higher. I generally give 30th decimal in frequently\\n      repeated doses until favorable symptoms are observed. I have many a time\\n      saved desperate cases of cholera by giving the 200th dilution when lower\\n      and 30th had failed.\\n      \\n Arsenic has been administered\\n      indiscriminately without reference to its indications. This is a bad\\n      practice and harmful. it is for this reason Dr. Bell says \"that\\n      Arsenic does more harm than good in the hands of ignorant persons.\".\\n      \\n Camphor has been used in cases of\\n      collapse, but I have not used it very frequently. It may be given in\\n      following indications: Diarrhoea and vomiting; sudden prostration;\\n      coldness of the surface; cold sweat; bluish countenance; husky voice and\\n      violent cramps. It should be cautiously given an as soon as improvement is\\n      perceptible and warmth returns it must be stopped.\\n      \\n Aconite is pre-eminently one of the\\n      best remedies in the collapse stage of Cholera. Dr. Richard Hughes\\n      remarked that in our day Aconite will be a valuable medicine for cholera.\\n      This was written long ago and I think that day is come and Aconite is used\\n      extensively and with good results.\\n      \\n Indications.-Great anxiety and fear of\\n      death; icy coldness of the whole body; cold perspiration; great thirst;\\n      labored respiration with pains and oppression of chest; pulse quick,\\n      thready and scarcely perceptible; heart\\'s action weak and slow. In cases\\n      of violent cramps and pains in abdomen it is one of my great helps. An\\n      elderly lady had an attack of cholera a few years ago with collapse and\\n      unbearable pains in the epigastric region. Many Homoeopathic remedies had\\n      been tried without effect. I found her in great agony and gave her Aconite\\n      1x every half hour and after two days she was relieved of her pains and\\n      reaction took place. For cholera in warm days and cool nights and after\\n      exposure to cold I find Aconite valuable.\\n      \\n Carbo Veg. is another of our important\\n      collapse remedies. I used it in many cases of impending death and with\\n      good results. When reactive power is gone it is indicated. Indications:\\n      patient lies as if dead; there is not the slightest sign of irritability\\n      about him; pulselessness; cold and clammy sweat; leaden hue of the body;\\n      husky voice; difficult and labored respiration; no thirst; no purging and\\n      vomiting; abdomen often distended; urine quite suppressed. Lower dilutions\\n      have no effect. I generally use it in the 30th and upwards.\\n      \\n Hydrocyanic acid is a marvellous\\n      medicine when indicated, acting promptly and often snatching away patients\\n      from the very verge of death. On one occasion, I had to attend a little\\n      girl gasping for the last breath and no power of swallowing medicines or\\n      anything. I poured a few drops of Hydrocyanic acid 3x on a clean\\n      handkerchief and held it to her nostrils and to my utter surprise I found\\n      her breathing quietly in a few minutes, and she made an ultimate recovery.\\n      it is for this reason that our esteemed colleague Dr. Mohendra Lal Sircar\\n      speaks of it in these terms: \"If any remedy is entitled to be spoken\\n      of as a charm it is Hydrocyanic acid. It would seem at times to restore\\n      animation to a corpse.\" Indications: icy coldness of body with\\n      pulselessness; cadaverous expression; breathing slow, deep and somewhat\\n      spasmodic in character; breathing of the heart slow; urine and stool\\n      generally suppressed. I generally give it in the 3x or 6x dilution every\\n      half hour or more frequently.\\n      \\n Cholera or Naja-Tripudians.-This is a\\n      medicine from a venomous snake of India. The effect of this poison is very\\n      swift, like the rapidly destructive nature of cholera. Our learned Dr.\\n      Salzer speaks of it and Lachesis in the following words: \"We\\n      administer them when respiration quickens, becoming at the same time more\\n      and more superficial, while the heart\\'s action is normal and still\\n      comparatively vigorous. This sort of respiration is a sure sign of\\n      impending paralysis of the respiratory is a sure sign of impending\\n      paralysis of the respiratory centre and coincides so far, exactly with\\n      what occurs under the venomous influence of snake poison.\" I use it\\n      in the 6th centesimal dilution every hour or so.\\n      \\n Secale cor.-Another important remedy in\\n      collapse and some other stages of cholera in Secale.\\n      \\n Indications.-Watery, slimy and\\n      offensive stools, vomiting of water and mucus; eyes sunken; violent cramps\\n      of the calves, hands and chest; great restlessness and thirst; difficulty\\n      of breathing, pulselessness or small, slow and almost imperceptible pulse;\\n      coldness of the body, but patient feels very hot and cannot keep clothes\\n      on. I have very little confidence in Secale in the stage of collapse, but\\n      in other respects it is a very useful remedy. I am often able to relieve\\n      distressing cramps when Cuprum fails. I find it especially beneficial in\\n      that dreadful symptom-the cramps and pains in the side of the chest and\\n      more in spasm of the heart. Appearance of menstrual flow during an\\n      invasion of cholera is a very serious matter, and in this I find Secale an\\n      admirable remedy. Typhoid conditions during and after cholera attacks are\\n      also very serious, and here Secale is powerful. Feverish heat after\\n      coldness; sleepiness with now and then restlessness or profound comatose\\n      sleep; pinched appearance; frequent and small pulse. It may be used in\\n      gangrene, bed sores, ulceration of cornea, and some other symptoms derived\\n      from low vitality of the system after an attack of cholera.\\n      \\n Verat, alb. is also useful in collapse\\n      state. Dr. Salzer writes as follows: \"I can hardly believe that\\n      Veratrum should not be as useful in collapse, owing to a paralytic\\n      condition of heart. Perhaps we give the remedy at too long intervals. Dr.\\n      C. Dunham recommends it to be given, like Camphor, every five minutes.\\n      Much of the bad reputation of the drug in collapse may also be owing to\\n      its not having always been administered at the right place and according\\n      to right indications.\".\\n      \\n Ant. tart. being a depressant remedy on\\n      the heart is recommended in cholera collapse, and I often find it useful.\\n      \\n Another remedy is Nicotine, the active\\n      principle of tobacco. My experience is very limited about this medicine.\\n      It may be administered in collapse with cold sweat, deadly nausea and\\n      sleepiness. I give it in delirium with comatose condition.\\n      \\n SEQUELAE AND COMPLICATIONS.\\n      \\n With the reaction stage our trouble\\n      does not end. Various other ailments await our poor patient, and we must\\n      be on our guard to combat them in time. These are as serious as an\\n      advanced stage of cholera proper. Many a time we lose our patients in this\\n      stage.\\n      \\n Uraemia.-If urine is not voided after\\n      reaction fully sets in, we must do something for it. Some physicians are\\n      in a hurry about urinary secretion, and they get so very impatient, as to\\n      wish it even in collapse stage. That is bad. When reaction is full we must\\n      stop all medicine and wait, and if healthy signs are not present, urine\\n      not voided, and fear of typhoid state supervening, then we must stir up.\\n      Many a time the previously administered drags are sufficient to restore\\n      urinary secretion; so without abandoning them or searching after now\\n      medicines we must continue them according to symptoms. Arsenic,\\n      Hydrocyanic acid, Tabacum and Nicotine are to be used with proper\\n      indications. But if they fail, and if there is impending congestion of the\\n      urinary organs, and subsequently of brain, we may resort to Belladonna.\\n      The use of it in the 30th dilution often gives prompt relief. Opium may be\\n      considered as one of the best remedies in this condition if there is a\\n      comatose state with uraemia. We have seen Agaricus musc. or Muscarin\\n      useful in such condition associated with pulselessness or small and\\n      thready pulse, coldness of the surface, comatose state and delirium.\\n      \\n If urine is collected in the bladder\\n      and there is sufficient expulsive effort but no urine voided, Cantharis 6x\\n      or 30 may be used with benefit. Failing this, and if there be some burning\\n      in the urethra, Terebinthina may be given.\\n      \\n I sometimes use Acidum carbolic 6x or\\n      12x in cases of uraemic intoxication and delirium in cholera, with the\\n      following indications: Constantly agitated, uttering a piercing cry,\\n      delirious staring from sleep; tongue dry, coated with thick, yellow fur,\\n      great thirst; high fever; urine is dark, black or blackish olive-green\\n      color. Our much-vaunted Kali bich. is not a good medicine in suppression\\n      of urine in my hands.\\n      \\n Fever.-In the reaction stage we often\\n      meet with feverishness, and when slight we must not give any medicine; but\\n      when it assumes graver form, and there is restlessness, thirst, dry,\\n      parched tongue, and full pulse, I generally give Aconite, failing which,\\n      Veratrum alb. may be used. If there is headache, flushed face and other\\n      symptoms, Belladonna high has its place. Rhus tox., Bryonia and Phosph.\\n      acid may be administered with proper symptomatic indications. These latter\\n      three medicines may be thought of when this reactionary fever assumes a\\n      typhoid form.\\n      \\n Hiccough is often a very distressing\\n      and obstinate complication. Our ordinary hiccough remedies cannot find\\n      their place here. Cuprum met. and Arsen. are very frequent helps. Veratrum\\n      alb., Nicotine and Hydrocyanic acid are recommended.\\n      \\n In the reaction stage there may be some\\n      faulty condition of the digestive tract generally, and we may think of Nux\\n      vomica, Cicuta, Phosphor, Ignatia, Belladonna and the like. We have seen\\n      patients cured, to all intents and purposes, when they were suddenly\\n      attacked with dyspnoea and died. Dr. Macnamara is of opinion that in these\\n      cases there is formation of clots in the right side of the heart, usually\\n      extending into the pulmonary arteries. Dr. Salzer, on the authority of Dr.\\n      Buchner, advised us to give Calc. ars. 6x or 12x, but death is so sudden\\n      that nothing can be done.\\n      \\n After the choleraic symptoms are over\\n      we sometimes get cases of obstinate diarrhoea. In those cases, when the\\n      stools are yellow and watery, quite copious and sudden, a few doses of\\n      Croton tig. are sufficient. When stools are saffron-yellow, watery, with\\n      severe colic, Colchicum is to be thought of.\\n      \\n When the stools are white or\\n      yellowish-white and much prostration, Phosph. acid or Podophyllum is\\n      given. If there is tympanitic distension of the abdomen, passage of\\n      flatus, rumbling, and thin yellow stools, Natrum sulph. or China may be\\n      given. One or two doses of Sulphur, higher dilution, is sufficient to\\n      being the stool into its natural color and consistency. When there is a\\n      tendency towards dysentery, stools are greenish, with tenesmus and colic.\\n      Merc. viv. is the remedy; but when they are bloody and slimy, Merc. cor.\\n      is the preparation used.\\n      \\n Vomiting is often persistent and\\n      troublesome, and defies all our well-selected remedies. In such cases some\\n      bland and mucilaginous food is all that can check it. I generally give\\n      some arrowroot or rice-water salted and acidulated. Our chief remedies in\\n      vomiting are Arsenic, Ipecac, Iris vers., Phosphorous, Kreosote, etc.\\n      Other complications may be treated as general diseases.\\n      \\n Diet.-There is a great diversity of\\n      opinion among medical men on this subject. From broth, brandy and other\\n      nourishments to no food is the prevailing idea on this subject. From\\n      practical observations in many cases, we are of opinion that during the\\n      progressive and collapse stages of cholera no food should be given except\\n      plenty of water and ice to appease thirst and cool down the stomach. After\\n      the tempest is over, bile appears with the evacuation; and, urinary\\n      secretion established, barley-or arrowroot-water, with thin fish or meat\\n      broth, may be allowed. When there is craving for food, gradual addition of\\n      nutritious but easily digestible food should be given. The stomach becomes\\n      very sensitive after an attack of cholera, so that particular care is\\n      necessary in giving food and nourishment.\\n      \\n DISCUSSION.\\n      \\n W.J. HAWKES, M.D.: I have been very\\n      much pleased to listen to this very excellent paper on this very important\\n      subject. I believe firmly in the old adage that an ounce of prevention is\\n      worth a pound of cure, so that the hygienic and medicinal prophylaxis of\\n      cholera is of extreme importance; that the hygienic prophylaxis is of much\\n      greater importance than the therapeutic prophylaxis, for the reason that\\n      the individual can take care of himself with the prophylaxis of hygiene,\\n      while he cannot take care of himself which the prophylaxis of\\n      therapeutics. The disease is rapid, and requires prompt attention when\\n      therapeutics are required. Consequently, I would put great stress upon\\n      this hygienic prophylaxis of cholera. I thick the prophylaxis of cholera\\n      may be summed up in three cardinal points; cleanliness, temperance, and a\\n      thorough cooking of everything that is taken into the stomach. The more\\n      recently it is cooked before being taken into the stomach the better. The\\n      prophylactic remedy acts in curing the sick, in this, that its action is\\n      to bring the individual health up to par as soon as possible.\\n      \\n In agreed to the remedies prescribed or\\n      described here by our foreign friend, the indications are remarkably well\\n      given. As far as experience goes, I have had none with cholera, but the\\n      indications given are remarkably applicable.\\n      \\n J.H. HENRY, M.D.: I am very much\\n      pleased with the paper of our friend from India, who represents the\\n      treatment of cholera by Homoeopathy. In 1849, when the cholera visited the\\n      United States, I was a student of medicine in New York city, and had\\n      charge of a Catholic lying-in hospital in that city. People died not only\\n      by scores but by hundreds. I was affected by the disease, but was cured by\\n      Arsenicum and Veratrum. A most remarkable thing occurred at that time. We\\n      were one night seated on a balcony discoursing about the question of\\n      cholera and its remedies. The ladies of the hospital were present. We had\\n      everything neat and clean; we had no sings of anything that would develop\\n      into cholera in the institution. Of these who were sitting on that balcony\\n      that night, every one was buried the next morning except myself.\\n      \\n What effect has Hydrocyanic acid upon\\n      cholera? In a practice of over forty years I have seen no effect produced\\n      by Veratrum, Cuprum, or Carb. vegetabilis upon cholera in its collapsed\\n      state. And now what are remedies when we have this extreme collapse of the\\n      whole nervous system? Our only remedy is Aconite, and for that remedy we\\n      are indebted to Dr. Hempel. Whenever you have those violent types, you\\n      must rely upon Aconite in appreciable doses. The paper is instructive. I\\n      am very glad that it has been read.', u'Tresorie - SOME OBSERVATIONS ON NEURASTHENIA AND ITS TREATMENT\\n[Neurasthenia & Treatment]\\n\\n WHEN, thirty-five years ago, the writer\\n      first made the acquaintance of what is now called neurasthenia, it was\\n      known as spinal irritation, and the best of modern researches have been\\n      unable to give a better definition beyond a functional disturbance of the\\n      spinal and cerebral nerves, dependent on a morbid process, for which\\n      \"irritation\" is as proper a term as any. As deaths do not occur,\\n      autopsies throw no light on the subject. Briefly stated, neurasthenia,\\n      when observed from the beginning through its chronic course, has a period\\n      of prodromal symptoms followed by a protracted acute, and succeeded by a\\n      still more protracted chronic, state, between the end of which and the\\n      beginning of convalescence there is a very vague, often indiscernible,\\n      boundary line.\\n      \\n The prodromal symptoms are quite\\n      indefinite and very variable, pointing to nothing in particular. Loss of\\n      appetite, irregular sleep, excitability alternating with lassitude, etc.,\\n      are often overlooked, especially when the second stage-display of unusual\\n      mental and physical energy without subsequent fatigue- becomes apparent.\\n      This is often mistaken for a sign of unusually good health. When a young\\n      girl or mature woman, married or unmarried, feels that she can study ten\\n      hours a day and devote half of her night to pleasure or business; when\\n      besides much mental occupation she begins to rejoice in long walks without\\n      fatigue, that is the time when the mischief is going on without exciting\\n      timely suspicion. Relief is at last sought when the functional disorder of\\n      the nerves has gone to the opposite extreme, and becomes manifest in what\\n      is properly and popularly termed \"nervous prostration,\" when\\n      instead of having no sense of fatigue, the best bodily or mental effort\\n      seems intolerable, in grave cases rendering the patient a helpless being,\\n      completely dependent on the unremitting assistance of others whom she )it\\n      is usually a woman) rules with the inexorable power of the vis inertiae.\\n      \\n During this usually very protracted\\n      period of the disease convalescence usually sets in, but so imperceptibly\\n      that the physician alone can sometimes estimate its progress, which is\\n      unnoticeable to others towards whom the patient acts as she has for months\\n      or years. This is the time for action, too often delayed from motives of\\n      misplaced sympathy on the part of relatives and friends.\\n      \\n The affections is in many instances\\n      limited to the spine, the mind becoming only secondarily tired. In other\\n      cases it is spinal and cerebral; in others again chiefly cerebral. The\\n      line between this and insanity is always clearly definable. Though a\\n      neurasthenic patient may become insane, and probably the reverse, yet both\\n      are distinct conditions.\\n      \\n Books speak of this disease at common\\n      to men and women. Yet in this region in small towns as well as in large\\n      cities the cases of neurasthenia in women are preponderatingly great.\\n      \\n Hypochondriacs and hysteria stand in\\n      peculiar relation to neurasthenia. They maybe regarded as different\\n      species of the same genus; that is, more or less deeply seated\\n      disturbances of the cerebro-spinal system in which the sympathetic system\\n      is probably indirectly involved, as many functional disturbances presided\\n      over by the great sympathetic system often testify. Hypochondriasis, pure\\n      and simple as occurring in men, is easily distinguishable by its striking\\n      characteristic of introspection and despondency, occasioned by abnormal\\n      sensations, without marked physical weakness and tiredness. Pure\\n      hypochondriacs are often energetic, conscientious workers. In hysteria\\n      there is neither great tiredness nor tendency to introspection, but a\\n      paroxysmal or prolonged absence of the power of self control, in grave\\n      cases associated with tonic or clonic muscular spasm and loss of\\n      consciousness. While neurasthenia in its uncomplicated forms is free from\\n      these symptoms, but, as ample experience teaches, often complicated with\\n      both of the preceding forms to such an extent that it is often very\\n      difficult to tell which is primary and which secondary. The symptoms known\\n      as introspection, hysterical aberrations of the emotions, and neurasthenic\\n      sense of exhaustion are in their distinctive manifestations most important\\n      and constitute indications in the selection of remedial and dietetic\\n      measures.\\n      \\n The following are some observation of\\n      peculiarities observed in a large number of cases and peculiar to all:.\\n      \\n Introspection.-The neurasthenic patient\\n      in variably expresses her desire for relief, not so much in a direct\\n      appeal as in a supplicating, subdued tone of voice and manner. She rarely\\n      asks, \"What can you do to relieve me?\" but almost invariably,\\n      \"What is the cause of\" this or that sensation? If she is\\n      introspective, that is, hypochondriacal, she becomes a nosomaniac,\\n      watching acutely every one of her numerous distressing sensation, on the\\n      unremitting analysis of which her mind dwells. In marked cases she is\\n      quite unable to think of anything outside of herself, and in many cases\\n      dislikes to do so, preferring to river her attention on herself. Attempts\\n      to divert her annoy or anger her. Friends and relatives implore the\\n      physician to divert the patient, but all their attempts are in vain\\n      because quite misdirected.\\n      \\n Positive and Negative Will.-It seems\\n      sometimes as if the patient delights in her self-inspection, and that she\\n      prefers her condition to speedy recovery. This is not the case, for the\\n      patient will always assure the physician of her wish to get well. During\\n      the acute stage-a long yet definable period-this wish and longing cannot\\n      well be utilized, but the long and ill-defined period of convalescence\\n      must first be awaited. Here we shall always discover that the wish and the\\n      will of the patient are two very different mental conditions. The desire\\n      or wish for recovery is entirely unattended by any will effort to\\n      accomplish the desired end. The injunctions and directions of the\\n      physician are resisted by the same unconquerable power of negative power,\\n      or vis inertiae. The patient having been unable to exert her will, now\\n      thinks herself unable to use it.\\n      \\n Numerous Symptoms of Patients.-To\\n      physicians in search of indications for medicines each statement of\\n      patient concerning a sensation is apt to be considered as a symptom. Many\\n      years ago, when resolved to get at the keynote of a patient\\'s case, the\\n      writer determined to allow the patient to detail all her symptoms as long\\n      as she chose and to take accurate notes of each one till the right one\\n      should be disclosed; and this was to be done regardless of time and\\n      exertion. The patient, one who needed no urging to describe her\\n      \"symptoms,\" began in an almost inaudible voice, detailing one\\n      sensation after another with an unrivalled degree of clearness and\\n      vividness of expression; as she proceeded the voice became stronger, her\\n      face slightly flushed, and the most perfect descriptive language flowed in\\n      an endless stream. Each word was written down, page after page was filled;\\n      still she went on with unmistakable signs of satisfaction at being able to\\n      pour her pent-up emotions into willing and sympathetic ears. If, for a\\n      moment, the flow of language was interrupted, a simple question would\\n      re-animate her to proceed with renewed energy. Feelings seemed to beget\\n      feelings; their complexity gave the patient no trouble; her intellect was\\n      equal to the action of unraveling the most complicated sensation,\\n      separating them into their component parts and spreading them out before\\n      the mind of the listener. A glance at the watch showed that nearly two\\n      hours had passed, during which the feeblest of neurasthenic patients had\\n      talked incessantly. The note-book was full, the keynote was found. It was\\n      this: neurasthenic patients have innumerable sensation and exhibit no\\n      sings of fatigue after talking incessantly for nearly two hours.\\n      \\n Great Endurance of Neurasthenics.-The\\n      instance just related, which is one of many, illustrates two things. One\\n      is, that it is not the kind of sensation described but the fact that\\n      neurasthenics have innumerable sensations, that constitute the symptoms.\\n      The other thing is that many neurasthenics are capable of great exertion\\n      without suffering disagreeable after- effects from fatigue. This is\\n      illustrated by other cases of which I have notes. A highly neurasthenic\\n      young lady consented to camp out for her health near a lake. She was\\n      induced to join a party for a short walk along the lake. By trying what\\n      they thought a shorter road the party lost their way and took a very long\\n      walk of about four hours, through bogs and over forces. The neurasthenic\\n      was less fatigued than some of the others. The interesting observation was\\n      subsequently made that the patient had become interested in a young man of\\n      the party. She recovered her health within a year from that time. Other\\n      cases of this kind will appear under the head of therapeutic suggestions.\\n      \\n Neurasthenic Patients Crave\\n      Sympathy.-This is one of the most formidable obstacles to the curative\\n      management of such cases, for the kind of sympathy such patients crave is\\n      expressions of condolence and more or less deep affliction at so much\\n      suffering as the patient expresses. Such sympathy is most natural and does\\n      honor to the feelings of parents, sisters, brothers and husbands, but it\\n      is unfortunate that the deeper their expression of affliction so much the\\n      more profound will be the mental dejection and weakness of the patient.\\n      Almost every case which has come under the writer\\'s observation has been\\n      much hampered if not made hopeless by this condition of things, against\\n      which no remedy suggests itself that would not be construed as\\n      \"unkind\".\\n      \\n The origin of this very formidable and\\n      refractory nervous disease, like that of most diseases usually termed\\n      chronic, is either hereditary or acquired, as the histories of every\\n      observed case plainly testify. Either the father was a hypochondriac or\\n      the mother neurasthenic, or both parents were of unsound nervous\\n      constitution. Dipsomania on the part of parents produces neurasthenia in\\n      the children, as readily as it will be followed by any other form of\\n      nervous disease, according to the individual predisposition of the\\n      offspring. The excessive use of tea and coffee is another very active\\n      factor in the history of neurasthenics. Where fathers inclined to alcohol,\\n      mothers are addicted to tea and coffee, which, while its immediate effects\\n      do not obtrude themselves upon our notice, are none the less insidious in\\n      their more remote consequences.\\n      \\n The acquired forms of neurasthenia are\\n      of utmost interest to the therapeutist, and the sources of acquisition are\\n      readily stated. They are much brain-work with insufficient food and sleep.\\n      Such conditions obtain chiefly in women (less frequently in men) of fine\\n      intellectual ability, conscientiousness and ambition. Physical overwork\\n      with unintellectual women has no such effect. Quite analogous to the above\\n      are the conditions of care and sorrow, especially in women who are able\\n      for a long time to conceal and control their emotions. The usual\\n      consequence of such states of mind is disregard of food and insufficient\\n      sleep. Instances of acquired neurasthenia are presented in families of\\n      several girls and boys, where one or more of the former are Neurasthenic\\n      while the latter are vigorous and athletic. Boys delighting in vigorous\\n      exercise do not, as is the case with girls, lose appetite and sleep.\\n      \\n The effects of nervous exhaustion in\\n      boys are usually much less grave than in girls; as a rule such effects are\\n      manifested in mental, not muscular, tiredness, and they are relieved by\\n      air and exercise, while in girls and women those influences are shunned\\n      because they seem to increase the tiredness.\\n      \\n Predisposition-The temperament, or what\\n      in modern pharaseology is called the personal equation, plays a visible\\n      but uncontrollable part in the progress of neurasthenia, as temperament\\n      greatly determines the other imperfectly known condition known as\\n      predisposition. Where the disease is hereditary, it is easy to say that\\n      the predisposition is due to that source; where there is no history of\\n      heredity and where neurasthenia exists in the last members of a\\n      generation, it may be attributed to acquired predisposition which needed\\n      only the exciting cause to establish the disease in its most typical form.\\n      \\n One of the most common forms of\\n      neurasthenia, often quite intractable, results from a serious defect in\\n      our public school system, one which affects chiefly girls from twelve to\\n      fourteen years of age. The following is a brief example: The child rises\\n      late with no appetite for breakfast and no time to eat it if so inclined.\\n      The lessons, however, have been learned the evening before, and the school\\n      work is begun with an ambitions will and a crammed mind, and continues\\n      with one intermission of often not more than ten minutes or three of four\\n      hours. The pupil arrives at home ravenously hungry, eats too fast, and too\\n      much of injudiciously prepared food, too long in digesting to leave room\\n      for an appetite for even a light evening meal, or even for a breakfast the\\n      next morning.\\n      \\n In another case the girl or boy grows\\n      desperately hungry while at school, but being unprovided with food\\n      (lunch), goes on with the school exercises, at the end of which the sense\\n      of hunger has vanished and has been replaced by an aversion to normal\\n      food, with a possible craving for something pungent and indigestible. This\\n      observation can easily be made in many instances, and will, in as many\\n      cases, be seen to lead to nervous prostration, which is then treated by\\n      vile, patented concoctions consisting largely of whiskey, under the name\\n      of \"tonics,\" while the patient needs only the best that a\\n      legitimate market affords prepared in a sensible manner.\\n      \\n Typical Cases Ending in Rapid\\n      Recovery.-Curative results have already been indicated in what has been\\n      said above, and further indications for treatment may be gathered from a\\n      few cases of extremely rapid recovery of apparently incurable cases, to\\n      which brief allusion will here be made. A woman of forty had been a victim\\n      of grave neurasthenia for five years. In the absence of an inclination to\\n      exert himself, she had, during that period, been mostly confined to her\\n      bed or lounge, in the meantime giving birth to two children, going through\\n      gestation and confinement normally, without recovering from neurasthenic\\n      prostration which, in the course of some years more, rendered her entirely\\n      helpless. Her condition was associated with a feeling of dropping to\\n      pieces unless supported and braced by a harness of wood, iron and leather,\\n      in which she \"sat up\" for several hours each day, spending the\\n      rest of the time in bed. Having left the patient in this condition, it was\\n      reported before the writer\\'s next professional visit that Mrs.-had been\\n      cured, and that she was able to go out like other people. A visit to the\\n      house confirmed the report. The patient came to the door herself, and in a\\n      quiet manner, entirely without the least expression of joy or wonder at\\n      her release, stated, that having heard of a famous \"magnetic\\n      physician,\" she summoned him, was ordered by him to arise and stand;\\n      protesting that it was impossible, she was raised to her feet and again\\n      ordered to stand, then to walk. Fearing that she would fall, she begged\\n      the magnetic doctor to support her, which he peremptorily refused, saying\\n      she might fall if she liked. Instead of falling, she had to walk about the\\n      room, was then placed upon a lounge and subjected to a severe treatment of\\n      rolling and pummelling, and then ordered to dress and sit up until tired,\\n      to remain up and about like other people, and to call on the doctor in\\n      future, as he would not come so far to the patient again. This happened\\n      about twenty-five years ago, and the patient has been in very fair health\\n      arrested by insisting that all professional visits by the writer or any\\n      other physician to whose sympathy the patient could appeal must cease.\\n      This injunction was carried out conscientiously with the best results by\\n      the husband of the patient. Perhaps we may learn from this that sometimes,\\n      at least, the familiar motto is reversed, and angels rush in where fools\\n      fear to tread.\\n      \\n Profiting by this experience, another\\n      neurasthenic woman, unmarried, but of most intractable, antagonistic\\n      temperament, confined to her bed, in and out of hospitals, for years,\\n      wearing out the strength and means of her relatives and the patience of\\n      many physicians, was at length abandoned by them. It was a case of spinal\\n      and cerebral neurasthenia complicated with hypochondriasis in its most\\n      trying form of introspective maunderings and endless description of\\n      symptoms. She tormented her advisers by her endless tirades, the\\n      indulgence of which invariably aggravated her condition, and were there\\n      fore avoided, until once her physician yielded to the patient\\'s\\n      importunities for a visit, when be found her in her usual abject state of\\n      prostration. Guided by experience derived from cases like the one first\\n      described, he assisted the patient to her feet and marched her, will you\\n      nil you, up and down the room until he, at least, was thoroughly tired,\\n      and then departed with the promise never to do so again. The patient, on\\n      her part, made a number of her unnameable promises, but kept on her feet\\n      and let the doctors alone. Though not cured of deeply-rooted morbid mental\\n      faults, the neurasthenic phase of her condition had yielded to the change\\n      of the antagonistic element of her character from passive to very\\n      practical activity. A third very serious case of this kind occurred in the\\n      person of a girl of fifteen, of selfish character, who gradually became\\n      bed-ridden with spinal and cerebral neurasthenia, and tormented with the\\n      usual multifarious painful sensations, none of which, on the most\\n      pains-taking physical examination, resulted from demonstrable organic\\n      disease of genital or abdominal organs. The patient was most tenderly\\n      cared for by her mother, who, in the course of years, became so imbued\\n      with the idea of yielding to every wish and whim of the patient, that at\\n      length remonstrance became useless. The mother, though recognizing the\\n      importance of persuading or urging her daughter to depend more on herself,\\n      admitted that she had yielded so long that now she must continue to feed,\\n      dress and assist her charge in the most trivial things. Her food had to be\\n      placed in her mouth, the position of a hand or foot changed by some one\\n      else, although patient did so spontaneously when she chose. This went on\\n      for fifteen years, when the mother, growing old and feeble, died. Her\\n      maternal support being gone, the patient at once proved her ability to\\n      walk, to dress, to feed herself, and to seek light employment. Though far\\n      from well, she is equally far fro being a helpless, bed-ridden invalid.\\n      \\n A fourth case, still very vividly\\n      impressed on the writer\\'s mind, was one of a healthy, romping girl of 14,\\n      who, as happen in this remarkably capricious disease, in the midst of\\n      perfect health, one day took to her bed and remained there with all the\\n      symptoms of neurasthenia, involving first the spinal and finally the\\n      cerebral nerves. This patient was very amiable, conscientious, and\\n      sensible, never loquacious, and not troubled with hypochondriacal thoughts\\n      or sensations. Tiredness was the only expression she used in describing\\n      her feelings. There was literally no variation from this condition, which\\n      confined her to her bed for years, till she grew from a girl to a woman.\\n      Eating and sleeping well, and improving perceptibly in personal appearance\\n      and character, yet she lay on her couch tired and watched over with\\n      unremitting care by a most anxious mother, showing her solicitude and\\n      sympathy in every feature. Once, in the second year of the disease, a\\n      favorable interruption occurred. The mother, still a young woman, gave\\n      birth to another child. During her confinement the neurasthenic patient\\n      was in charge of her mother\\'s nurse, assisted by other servants. The\\n      nurse, while devoted to the daughter, agreed with the writer that excess\\n      of sympathy was injurious, and used her best and judicious endeavors\\n      gradually to persuade the patient to make some physical effort at walking\\n      and standing. In this she was so successful that in two weeks she\\n      accompanied the girl on half-mile walks up and down hill, finally without\\n      assistance. Thus, recovery seemed assured, and everything was favorable\\n      progressing towards it when the mother, having fully recovered, again took\\n      charge of her daughter, with the result that she at once took to her\\n      lounge and remained there two years longer. About that time other advice\\n      was urged and gladly acceded to, with the result that the case was\\n      diagnosed by an eminent surgeon as spinal paralysis in consequence of\\n      concussion, though it could never be shown when and where it occurred.\\n      Salves, plasters, anodynes, nervines, and electricity did no good, but\\n      effectually destroyed appetite and digestion, which higher to had been\\n      normal. So this adviser resigned in favor of a third, who, being a younger\\n      and less prejudiced man, agreed perfectly with the writer\\'s original\\n      opinion. He advised return to moderate exercise, avoidance of drugs, and\\n      less display of sympathy. This, though formerly rejected as\\n      \"unkind,\" was now acceded to as coming from a nerve- specialist,\\n      fresh from Europe, at that time very rare. Still attending the other\\n      members of the family, the writer had sample opportunity of observing the\\n      course of the case. Improvement was very slow and uncertain till financial\\n      misfortune overtook the family. Almost with a bound our patient left her\\n      cough, and, organizing a kindergarten, strove energetically in supporting\\n      herself and assisting her mother. The change came about in less than three\\n      weeks, and resulted in perfect recovery.\\n      \\n At this point another very instructive\\n      case of very speedy recovery, after six or seven years of neurasthenic\\n      prostration, deserves to be mentioned. A woman of 35 had been in bed and\\n      on the lounge most of the time for nearly seven years, at the end of which\\n      time she became my patient, her regular medical attendant having gone to\\n      Europe. She was of very amiable disposition and as sensitive as she was\\n      weak. Her symptoms, as in the other cases, were instantaneous exhaustion\\n      on the least physical exertion. She could give herself up to no mental\\n      occupation beyond directing her house-hold affairs, the education of her\\n      son, and the rehearsal of her numerous sensations. She had not been my\\n      patient long when her husband failed in business, so that the family was\\n      reduced from very comfortable circumstances to a condition which made it\\n      necessary for the patient to make her own living and that of the family.\\n      This she almost at once proceeded to do, setting aside all other\\n      considerations and establishing a boarding-house, where she did most of\\n      the work herself. This she has done now for ten or twelve years without a\\n      serious relapse. The time involved in the period of convalescence was\\n      scarcely more than three weeks, a although her work maybe said to have\\n      begun at the moment her resolution was taken.\\n      \\n Prognostics.-From these and other cases\\n      in and outside of the writer\\'s practice, it is safe to say that the\\n      majority of cases of neurasthenia recover, though years may elapse before\\n      that period. We learn, furthermore, that recoveries, especially of very\\n      inveterate cases, depend on conditions beyond the control of the\\n      physician, as was the case in the above-recorded instances, where\\n      circumstances forced the patient to cases to wish for recovery and to make\\n      an effort of the will. This having been once accomplished self-confidence,\\n      for a long time in abeyance, was permanently restored.\\n      \\n Curability, further, depends very much\\n      on the temperament of the patient, whether amiable, tractable and\\n      confiding in the honest endeavors of the physician, or whether refractory,\\n      suspicious, untruthful, selfish and antagonistic, of a disposition\\n      impossible to win over on account of unnatural distrust of every\\n      well-meaning person. The degree of intelligence of patients also has a\\n      pronounced influence on the result. The most readily curable cases are\\n      those acquired without hereditary predisposition, where the cause is found\\n      in the absence of food and sleep, also where sorrow and anxiety can be\\n      averted or counteracted by judicious conduct of near relatives and\\n      friends.\\n      \\n Dietetic Treatment.-This, as medicinal\\n      treatment, must be governed by the stage at which the case comes into the\\n      physician\\'s hands-whether yet in its prodromal, its acute or its chronic\\n      phase. The prodromal stage of the disease has no very decided\\n      pathognomonic signs. The most that can be recognized in this stage is that\\n      the patient\\'s habits or duties are of a kind which will eventually lead to\\n      obdurate neurasthenia if not arrested in time by removing the exciting\\n      causes. Too much pleasure, as well as too much care, especially in girls\\n      and woman, tends to neglect of food and rest, in the absence of which,\\n      excitements, whether of pleasure or care, begets a state of unrest in\\n      which repose is disagreeable. With such a condition comes a list of\\n      incipient casual complaints of headache, imperfect sleep, notional ways of\\n      eating, working or playing. A few questions will determine whether the\\n      patient is living according to normal or abnormal habits with regard to\\n      appetite, sleep and occupation. Where these are found, their alteration to\\n      normal ways must be instead on. It is unnecessary to say that this is\\n      easier said than done, for it will probably meet with serious objections\\n      on the part of the patient, if not on that of her relatives; for most\\n      likely she has examinations for college to prepare for, involving several\\n      months of dose and careful study at night, and the patient cannot waste\\n      time in sleeping and eating while cramming that little excited and\\n      ambitions brain. A failure in the examinations would be as much of a\\n      disappointment to parents as to patient, who proves, as usual, that this\\n      appellation is a misnomer. She accordingly goes in as she please, lied by\\n      an increasing morbidly ambitions impulse, and the result is likely to be\\n      the mournful satisfaction on the part of the physician of being obliged to\\n      say, \"I told you before what would happen.\" Of course, all\\n      regret the now evident nerve-prostration, while, if the doctor had\\n      succeeded in enforcing his rules, he would in many cases experience the\\n      still more painful reproach of having been too severe. Nevertheless,\\n      absolute firmness and a kindly but unflinching exertion of his will,\\n      without the least compromise, reward the physician with the best results\\n      in such cases.\\n      \\n When the case, after the stage of\\n      excitement and untiring restlessness (at which it would still be speedily\\n      curable by simple dietetic rules) has, after weeks or months, entered upon\\n      the phase of painful prostration, here we encounter backache, oppressive\\n      headache, and absolute loss of mental or bodily endurance, measures of\\n      dietetic management are much less effective and much more difficult to\\n      find. it is at this stage that slight rise of temperature will occur,\\n      especially towards evening; then the backache and headache disappear, the\\n      pallor is replaced by a flush of color, the eyes lose their listless look,\\n      and the patient is inclined to enter upon some diversion or excitement,\\n      followed by a restless night and a morning of exhaustion and a renewal of\\n      all painful sensations. Most of such patients feel much better in the\\n      evening when they are ready for some entertainment, while in a normal\\n      state this would be the time for relaxation and repose.\\n      \\n The dietetic treatment of this stage is\\n      methodical rest. In severe cases the patient will do well to remain in bed\\n      for several days or even for weeks. It is well to shorten this period as\\n      much as possible and to insist on walking about, or, at least. sitting for\\n      a specified time every day. This may be varied b equally specified periods\\n      of rest in the recumbent position.\\n      \\n Irregularities of eating are at this\\n      and at all times to be superseded by the most rigid regularity of meals.\\n      The traditional and conventional three-meal system, however well adapted\\n      to the needs of a vigorous man or woman, does not agree with the\\n      neurasthenic patient. It is much better that these should eat oftener;\\n      four times a day is best in most cases, for the simple reason that in this\\n      way a patient, while eating less at a time, consumes more food in the\\n      aggregate.\\n      \\n As neurasthenic patients are rarely\\n      troubled with absolute aversion to wholesome food, they are generally able\\n      to consume a liberal quantity, about which it is only needful to remark\\n      here that the food should be selected from among the articles and dishes\\n      which the patient likes, provided they belong to the order of good, normal\\n      articles of food, to the exclusion of those which simply please the taste\\n      without being digestible. A dish entirely of meat or \"animal\\n      food\" is as far from being a good diet for neurasthenics as one\\n      consisting entirely of \"vegetable\" food. As a rule, the diet\\n      list should comprise one-third of nitrogenous material and two-thirds of\\n      carbohydrates. Together with these, it is a great mistake to neglect the\\n      fats, such as good butter and the fats of meats. And, lastly, every\\n      patient of this kind should be made to drink some water often, a dietetic\\n      feature too often neglected.\\n      \\n During this stage, actually fatiguing\\n      exercise of body and mind should be avoided, while, on the other hand, the\\n      patient\\'s mind should be directed away from herself, in which she is much\\n      assisted by withholding a certain kind of emotional sympathy, quite as\\n      natural as it is difficult to repress on the part of affectionate persons.\\n      Of this, a few words further on.\\n      \\n There is no definite time for the\\n      duration of this stage, which, however, depends largely on the time during\\n      which the exciting causes have acted, either aided by or without a\\n      predisposition. It is certain, however, that the sooner it is recognized\\n      and the exciting causes eliminated, so much the sooner recovery will\\n      begin. But there is a stage at which the best of experience and judgment\\n      often fail, especially in very inveterate cases. If the case is one of a\\n      patient whom the physician has had opportunity of watching at least since\\n      the earlier stages, the difficulty is not so great as it is in old cases\\n      months or even of several years\\' duration which come to treatment late. In\\n      these, the line between the intermediate stage and incipient convalescence\\n      cannot be drawn. The patient is as neurasthenic and hypochondriacal as\\n      ever; cannot bear the slightest mental or bodily exertion, not even a word\\n      or a look, without sings of apparent exhaustion, while nearly the whole\\n      time is spent in bed under anxious care of sympathetic attendants. In such\\n      cases, having become assured, by careful physical examination, of the\\n      absence of organic disease, seeing the patient generally well nourished\\n      and in fair muscular condition, the physician is warranted in assuming\\n      that the disease has run its course, that whatever morbid (pathological)\\n      process there may have been progressing in the nervous system, this\\n      process has now come to and end, but it has left the patient\\'s mental\\n      condition habituated to the moods of the past months or years, and fixed,\\n      as it were, indelibly in the memory. It is the habit that now remains, not\\n      the disease.\\n      \\n If reasonably sure of this, and calling\\n      to mind the rapid recoveries and the circumstances attending them, as\\n      above detailed, the physician is now safe in ordering a more energetic\\n      treatment, calculated to rouse the self-reliance of the patient. All\\n      visible signs of sympathy must now be set aside; the actins and demeanor\\n      of the attendants should, from this time, if not before, be changed so as\\n      to give the patient the impression that she is no longer an invalid, but\\n      expected to rely on her own exertion. Instead of being fed, the food\\n      should be placed where she must go for and eat it. She should now be\\n      expected to dress and attend, without assistance, to her natural wants.\\n      This, with some temperaments, is almost impossible, with al extremely\\n      difficult. The best course to pursue is to remove such patients from\\n      sympathetic relatives or friends, and to place them in charge of kind,\\n      reliable, but eminently practical nurses.\\n      \\n The first effect of this is either to\\n      throw the patient into a stage of helpless despondency, which, again\\n      appealing powerfully to the sympathies of those nearest to her, often\\n      frustrates the physician\\'s plans which, if firmly but kindly adhered to,\\n      would, ere long, prove of their superiority by signs of returning\\n      self-reliance and absence of complaints on the part of the patient. A\\n      second form of effect is that occurring in patients of obstreperous,\\n      selfish disposition, whose opposition and even anger is aroused by being\\n      thrown on their own resources after the removal of depressing and\\n      unpractical sympathy. This opposition or temper, often manifested in all\\n      sorts of intrigues and subterfuges on the part of the patient, if not\\n      supinely yielded to by sympathetic persons, will finally be replaced by a\\n      more rational disposition. On the whole, anger or active opposition are\\n      signs of returning energy, which, once coming to the consciousness of the\\n      patient, takes the form of self- reliance. it is this way that the cures\\n      of chronic cases above related can be explained, and physicians should\\n      profit by such experience for the benefit of their patients.\\n      \\n The general dietetic management now\\n      readily follows from what has been said, and needs only a few general\\n      modifications. The first duty of the physician will be to test the degree\\n      of reliance to be placed on the patient and her friends, ad to win them\\n      over if possible to his plans, and his success will be in proportion to\\n      the degree of confidence he is able to inspire. This personal confidence\\n      should not degenerate into a mere personal liking or attachment of a\\n      sympathy-craving neurasthenic who should discover henceforth that all\\n      sentimental expressing of sympathy are about to take a practical form,\\n      aiming at a definite result-the patient\\'s health-which she wishes but\\n      cannot exert her will to attain. The best and often the only way to do\\n      away with sentiment and to reach practical kindness is to remove the\\n      patient from certain home influence, and to place her in a hospital or\\n      elsewhere under the management of competent nurses who, without being\\n      selfish, know how to exert a certain amount of wholesome push as fast as\\n      the patient can bear it. Without the removal of sentimental sympathy, all\\n      efforts at counteracting the purely hypochondriacal side of neurasthenia\\n      are useless.\\n      \\n In these cases of neurasthenia as yet\\n      uncomplicated with the hypochondriacal element of introspective nosomania,\\n      there is only one unconditional rule to be followed, especially in\\n      acquired cases whose evident cause was incessant, conscientious work of\\n      mind and body, together with insufficient food and sleep. Such cases come\\n      on very insidiously, the loss of strength-that is, the actual waste of\\n      nerve-substance-being just a trifle grater than the quantity restored, the\\n      patient unconsciously using up a minute part of her capital every day.\\n      Here the rule should be to reverse matters to insuring a supply of\\n      nourishment and time for its assimilation greater than was the case\\n      heretofore. The case of young school-girls belong in this class. The time\\n      of food and rest should be carefully controlled at home, the duty of the\\n      physician being to educate indifferent and ignorant parents up to an\\n      appreciation of the nature of the case. It is generally not difficult to\\n      open their eyes through the medium of their anxiety concerning their\\n      children\\'s health. Having thus insured sufficient rest and food at home,\\n      the physician\\'s next object of attention should be the regulations of the\\n      school. Here is the point where teachers have an opportunity of exerting\\n      their most practical influence. It should be made obligatory on the part\\n      of teachers to institute inquiry as to whether pupils have had their meals\\n      before coming to school. This they could often ascertain without a\\n      question, by reading the pupil\\'s condition in her emaciated form, pale\\n      face and nervous manner. To guard against neglect at home, it would be an\\n      easy matter to insist that all pupils of public and private schools should\\n      bring with them some proper food. The few who do so generally bring\\n      sweets-an apple, orange or a few dry crackers-when a piece of good bread\\n      and slice of cold meat would be what they actually need. All pupils should\\n      pass inspection, and if remiss in this important particular, the\\n      delinquent should be dismissed with several marks against her. To expect\\n      this of teachers would be a great advance in the place of futile\\n      innovations of endeavoring to send forth from our common schools graduates\\n      in arts and sciences.\\n      \\n Sudden Effects.-A large number of cases\\n      of neurasthenia, especially those complicated with inveterate\\n      Hypochondriasis, are frequently traced to some sudden occurrence, having\\n      the effect of a mental or physical shock. In one patient, a vigorous girl,\\n      used to romping, climbing and running lie a boy, the cause was supposed to\\n      be a slight thump she received during a game of blindman\\'s-buff. She\\n      thought nothing of it at the time, but it was suggested long after the\\n      patient\\'s illness began. In another case some mental shock of joy or\\n      grief, not very severe and such as is often experienced in every person\\'s\\n      life, is the beginning of months of nervous prostration.\\n      \\n There is quite an array of evidence\\n      that neurasthenia which has entered upon a hypochondriacal stage or\\n      complication with or without a strong hysterical admixture, is curable by\\n      sudden impressions in the form of a shock, or more gradually by frequent\\n      repetitions of an impression. Such cases, as I have shown above, occur\\n      most commonly in the stage when what may be considered the essential\\n      pathological disturbances of function have run their course and have left\\n      the patient in a state of mental disturbance which indicated that the\\n      patient\\'s recovery depends entirely upon her volition. But there is none,\\n      and so far nothing has succeeded in arousing it. Persuasion is as useless\\n      and irritating, as argument would be in a case of insanity with a fixed\\n      illusion. The resemblance between this and the state of mind of a\\n      hypochondriacal neurasthenic is very close. She cannot move nor thick.\\n      Exhaustion overcomes her and keeps her its victim for years, when suddenly\\n      the scene changes, and a few days or weeks suffice to restore the patient\\n      to activity. In one instance it is attributed to medical, in another to\\n      \"mind cure,\" in a third to \"Christian science;\" in\\n      still other cases massage has done it, in others again \"magnetic\\n      influence,\" in others the very powerful factor necessity. It is\\n      certain that cases of this kind, produced by sudden effects on the mind of\\n      a predisposed person, are also cured by such effects. Whatever the visible\\n      form of these effects may be -whether that of \"Christian\\n      science,\" joy, grief or absolute inexorable necessity, there is\\n      always to be noticed a certain force and condition involving the modern\\n      idea of suggestion, which comes to the patient in an irresistible degree\\n      and now sets the function of the will in motion again.\\n      \\n Experience teaches that it is by no\\n      means a matter of indifference which of these forms of effect are brought\\n      into action. In one case it is the professional Christian scientist\\'s\\n      method, in another the almost brutal exertion of a person\\'s will combined\\n      with some physical force. In either case the patient is aroused from his\\n      inertia, and discovers his powers of mental and bodily ability to act.\\n      \\n A deplorable result is that recoveries\\n      after such effects are attributed in the popular mind to supernatural\\n      causes. That such is not the case may be gathered form instances occurring\\n      in very sensible and intelligent patients, whose reason is scarcely ever\\n      so far disturbed and weakened that they do not resent the proposition of\\n      trying, e.g., Christian science or mind cure.\\n      \\n Nevertheless, it is the mind cure which\\n      the intelligent patient needs quite as much as the ignorant and\\n      superstitious person; the difference is only the form in which the\\n      influencing force is applied. While in one case it is obedience to the\\n      candidly expressed instructions of the physician, in the other case the\\n      result is the to mystification. In either case it is the powerful stimulus\\n      of hope and aroused confidence that recovery will be realized.\\n      \\n The definition of suggestion does not\\n      fully cover the meaning, because the influence employed is greater than\\n      mere suggestion. The physician\\'s plan of action should be straightforward\\n      assurance of recovery, a direct appeal to hope, and an unceasing endeavor\\n      to arouse the self-reliance of the patient, not so much by verbal\\n      exhortations as by a manner and department from which the patient learns\\n      more readily than from words what is expected. If the attitude of the\\n      physician is appreciated, and seconded by the relatives and attendants, a\\n      favorable result is much more certain to follow.\\n      \\n Hypnotism is not advisable. There are\\n      now existing ancient neurasthenic invalids dating from the times of\\n      spiritualism when they were famous \"mediums.\" Hypnotism weakness\\n      the will and nervous endurance, and produces a predisposition to emotional\\n      nervousness with an intractable erotic admixture. The suggestions sought\\n      to be instilled into a hypnotized patient amount to nothing. The mental\\n      influence of mystical treatment administered while the patients is awake\\n      is much more powerful in awaking hope and confidence than the uncertain\\n      effects of an abnormal state like that of hypnotism. Mystification, again,\\n      though sometimes unavoidable with the best intention, is less powerful\\n      than direct and intelligible encouragement. While resort to mystification\\n      should be shunned by reputable physicians, the question arises as to what\\n      shall be done with the many who, from lack of intelligence or education,\\n      are entirely beyond the reach of honest common sense, and who will persist\\n      in mystifying themselves, who remain neurasthenic invalids in spite of the\\n      best regulations of the physician, and who do not recover unless their\\n      encouragement follows some mystical formalities which alone arouse their\\n      \"faith\" and finally their confidence and will-power. For the\\n      present there is no way out of the dilemma but to submit such patients to\\n      the suggestive methods of what is popularly known as mind cure and\\n      Christian science. In doing so, physicians should use their influence as\\n      far as possible in selecting the most honest persons of this class.\\n      \\n DISCUSSION.\\n      \\n JAMES C. WOOD, M.D.: I have nothing but\\n      words of praise for Dr. Wesselhoeft\\'s excellent paper. It is very evident\\n      that the author\\'s inspiration came not from books but from actual contact\\n      with neurasthenic subjects, for the impress of originality is most\\n      conspicuous. It is a production which could only come from one of\\n      experience and from a reasoner. I consider it a most valuable contribution\\n      to the literature of that now most interesting subject,\\n      \"neurasthenia\".\\n      \\n The doctor, in his paper, has sometimes\\n      used the term \"neurasthenia\" instead of\\n      \"neurasthenia.\" The first of these means, according to Thomas,\\n      great nervous power or excitement; the second, nervous debility. I taken\\n      it from the context that the subject dealt with is neurasthenia. To the\\n      average mind there exists what seems to me a needless confusion regarding\\n      the terms, nervous prostration, hysteria and hystero-neurosis. As I\\n      understand these terms they define distinct conditions, though there is a\\n      frequent blending the one with the other. The term nervous prostration,\\n      which is a synonym of neurasthenia, defines itself; the term hysteria\\n      should be restricted to those general neuroses characterized particularly\\n      by psychical manifestations, though not infrequently by motor, sensory,\\n      secretory, vasomotor and reflex derangements as well; while the term\\n      hysteroneurosis implies the uterine origin of symptoms manifesting\\n      themselves in organs remote from the uterus without structural changes in\\n      such organs, being the direct result of reflex nervous influence starting\\n      from the uterus. The last term does not occur in the paper under\\n      discussion. From the standpoint of a gynecologist I think that this is\\n      misleading.\\n      \\n Let us see why and how it is that these\\n      three conditions (I will not call them diseases) are so frequently\\n      associated. I think that all will admit the frequent occurrence in woman\\n      of reflex symptoms, the result of pelvic lesions. An irritation staring\\n      form the pelvis is conveyed to the genito-spinal centre, thence to any or\\n      all organs with which this centre communicates. The organ oftener involved\\n      than any other is the stomach. This is shown by the frequent occurrence of\\n      nausea and vomiting following conception. The nervous system may have been\\n      previously involved, but oftener it becomes so only after the nutrition is\\n      depraved, which, sooner or later, occurs if the pelvic lesion is not\\n      removed. The depraved blood fails to supply the nerve centres with that\\n      which they need to sustain them, and they become anaemic. Prostration is\\n      but a subjective manifestation of the anaemia, and it varies in degree\\n      from a slight indisposition to the most abject helplessness.\\n      \\n If, then, nervous prostration may have\\n      its beginning in a pelvic lesion, is it possible for a pelvic lesion to be\\n      inaugurated by systemic disturbances? Personally, I believe that it is,\\n      and offer this explanation as the modus operandi by which such a lesion is\\n      induced: Marked circulatory changes nearly always attend nervous\\n      prostration. The circulation is presided over by the vaso-motor system,\\n      and wear and repair depend upon the proper regulation of this system. If\\n      it becomes disturbed, the bloodvessels dilate or contract unduly, with\\n      resulting local hyperaemia or local anaemia, as the case maybe. The\\n      climacteric flushes are the result of such disturbance. The alternate\\n      coldness and heat of the extremities, so often associated with rectal and\\n      uterine lesions, is another familiar illustration. If the brain is\\n      involved, either insomnia or drowsiness occur, depending upon whether the\\n      brain is anaemic or hyperaemic. Flatulence, gastralgia, and nervous\\n      dyspepsia result when the stomach is similarly affected. The womb and the\\n      ovaries, because of the periodical congestion imposed upon them, are\\n      oftener implicated by these unnatural circulatory disturbances than any of\\n      the pelvic organs, and in time also become unduly hyperaemic or anaemic,\\n      as the case may be.\\n      \\n It will thus be seen that nervous\\n      prostration may exist independently of pelvic lesions, or, conversely,\\n      pelvic lesions may exist independently of nervous prostration.\\n      Nevertheless, the two are frequently associated, and this fact ought, I\\n      believe, to be kept in mind in dealing with the affection known as\\n      neurasthenia. Hysterical manifestations nearly always come to the surface\\n      in nervous prostration, and they also frequently attend pelvic lesions.\\n      Indeed, the term \"hystero-psychosis\" has been coined for the\\n      purpose of defining certain psychical disturbances of presumably pelvic\\n      origin, and in the broadest sense neurasthenia is not uncommonly an\\n      hysteroneurosis. It is the frequent association of these three conditions\\n      which, it seems to me, makes it more practicable to study them conjointly.\\n      \\n The special symptoms of nervous\\n      prostration are most variable. Introspection, as Dr. Wesselhoeft has\\n      pointed out, makes of the patient a nosomaniac. The anaemic nerve centres\\n      are unduly impressionable, and a mental shock which would not seriously\\n      affect a stronger and more rugged woman falls with crushing force upon one\\n      whose nutrition is already depraved. In this way are developed disorders\\n      of sensibility, alternations of mobility, circulatory disturbances,\\n      anomalies of secretion and exertion, disorders of the gastro-intestinal\\n      canal, dermatoses, and general and psychical disturbances of all kinds.\\n      Many of these affections start from pelvic lesions, and are nearly always\\n      associated with depravity of nutrition and more or less nervous\\n      prostration.\\n      \\n Some of the worst symptoms of\\n      neurasthenia with which I have had to contend have been hyperaesthesia of\\n      the articulations, giving rise to the so-called \"hysterical\\n      joint.\" Here the prostration is usually not profound, and it is\\n      possible to apply the somewhat energetic treatment recommended by Dr.\\n      Wesselhoeft. I remember one case very distinctly, the detailed history of\\n      which I shall give in another place, which brought me much reputation\\n      because of the \"remarkable\" cure I was fortunate enough to make.\\n      \\n The patient, a beautiful girl of\\n      eighteen, had been bed- ridden for three years with supposed hip-joint\\n      disease. She was in college before assuming the ride of an invalid, and\\n      worried much over her studies and work. She sustained a fall a short time\\n      previously to taking to her bed, and to this fall the injury to the hip\\n      was attributed. She had been from physician to physician and from\\n      sanitarium to sanitarium without receiving benefit. All of the numerous\\n      medical men under whose care she had been, directed their attention to the\\n      hip and applied the classical treatment for morbus coxarius without avail.\\n      The patient had finally reached a point where introspection was her chief\\n      occupation and her mind dwelt almost continually upon a \"diseased\\n      hip.\" She was finally brought to me, coming in an invalid\\'s chair and\\n      looking the very picture of dependency. There was a slight degree of\\n      anaemia, though this was not marked. Notwithstanding the expression\\n      expression of abjectness the girl did not look seriously ill. The hip was\\n      excessively tender upon pressure, but there was no local increase of\\n      temperature, no evidences of fever and suppuration, and forcible\\n      apposition by striking the heel was not very painful. More less spastic\\n      contraction of the flexor muscles of the affected side existed, which gave\\n      to the limb an appearance of actual shortening, which was very deceptive.\\n      Hysterical symptoms were common. On examination I found the left ovary\\n      exquisitely tender. Compression of the ovary increased the pain in the hip\\n      most decidedly and gave rise to much nervous agitation. I did not,\\n      therefore, deem it wise to recommend local treatment other than the daily\\n      use of the hot douche. She had long been a victim of ovarian\\n      dysmenorrhoea. I placed upon the ankle of the affected limb three pounds\\n      of bar-lead, prescribed a pair of crutches and insisted upon her walking.\\n      The lead was used to overcome the spastic contraction as well as for its\\n      moral effect. I did not deem the joint lesion of such a character as to\\n      used extension. In two months\\' time this patient discarded her crutches\\n      for a cane. Six weeks later she put up the cane and is now perfectly well.\\n      \\n This was a case in which somewhat harsh\\n      measures were eminently appropriate.\\n      \\n In marked contrast to the case just\\n      recorded is the following: Mrs.-, aet. 47, widow for twenty years. She is\\n      a devoted church-woman, and for years was a leader in all charitable work\\n      done in the community in which she resided. Through friends she was urged\\n      to consult me, and I think that the call to the neighboring town in which\\n      she lived was countermanded at least four or five times before the finally\\n      mustered up courage and strength enough to see me. Upon reaching the\\n      bedside I found my patient in a room made dark by closed blinds, over\\n      which were hung heavy blankets to shut out every ray of light. The mirror\\n      was turned toward the wall for fear a ray of light might strike it and\\n      flesh throughout the darkened room. Nor did the patient rest under these\\n      extreme precautions, for the eyes were protected with two pairs of colored\\n      glasses with side attachments. Hyperaesthesia of the sense of hearing was\\n      equally marked and the noise was excluded from the room by double doors\\n      whose keyholes were stuffed with cotton. She l so had her ears filled with\\n      cotton, over which she wore ear-mufflers. She was emaciated to an extreme\\n      degree, and had been reduced to her miserable condition by a series of\\n      events which frequently precede profound neurasthenia. Her husband was\\n      killed during the war, and she was left childless. Twelve months previous\\n      to taking to her bed she nursed her mother through a long and fatal\\n      illness. This greatly prostrated her, yet she kept up until a favorite\\n      brother-in-law was thrown from a carriage and killed. This was the last\\n      straw, and the shock compelled her to take to her bed. In due time loss of\\n      appetite with irritability of the stomach developed, which, of course, led\\n      to marked depravity of nutrition. With the anaemia came hyperaesthesia of\\n      the special senses, spinal irritation, headache, hysterical\\n      manifestations, etc. There was no series pelvic lesion, although she had\\n      been much treated for an alleged uterine displacement with congestion.\\n      Unfortunately, she was encouraged, instead of discouraged, in her\\n      invalidism, and she soon became a nosomaniac of the worst type. She had\\n      written down her symptoms one at a time, and the record is such a typical\\n      one that I should like to give it in full, but time forbids.\\n      \\n With great difficulty the patient was\\n      moved on a cough to a private hospital and placed under the Weir Mitchell\\n      treatment. I ignored the pelvic trouble entirely. It is unnecessary to\\n      give in detail the progress of the case from day to day after this\\n      treatment was inaugurated. Suffice it to say that the improvement was of\\n      the most marked character, and in six weeks from the time she entered the\\n      hospital she walked to her carriage with her eyes and ears unprotected.\\n      She soon resumed her church and charitable work, in which she again takes\\n      much delight.\\n      \\n This woman wanted to get well. She was\\n      a woman of pure motives and high ideals. She had, in the language of Dr.\\n      Wesselhoeft, the wish, but, unaided, not the will. She required the aid of\\n      an intelligent, strong-minded, nurse who could bring to her exercise\\n      applied in such a way as to enable her to assimilate food without the\\n      expenditure of nerve force. She co- operated with her physician and nurse\\n      in every possible way, and as soon as the anaemic nerve cells became\\n      flushed with new blood she began to improve. To have commanded this\\n      patient \"to take up her bed and walk\" before improving her\\n      nutrition would have been as unscientific as to have placed the first\\n      patient in bed with extension and counter-extension applied to the limb. I\\n      know of no class of cases requiring for their successful treatment more\\n      tact and discrimination than that under consideration.\\n      \\n I feel confident that I have many times\\n      cut the affection short in its prodromal stage by removing the girl from\\n      college work and insisting upon open-air exercise. Static electricity has,\\n      in my hands, proved exceedingly useful both during the prodromal stage and\\n      that of convalescence.\\n      \\n I will conclude by saying that I have\\n      been impressed with the frequency with which an hereditary history of\\n      epilepsy has been met with in the cases of neurasthenia passing under my\\n      observation.', u'Tresorie - HAHNEMANN BI-CENTENNIAL CELEBRATION [Hahnemann Centennial\\nCelebration]\\n\\n The most notable functions in Calcutta\\n      was organised by the Bengal Homoeopathic Institute, 1B Old Post Office\\n      St., Cal. 1 and was held at Moslem Institute, 21A Wellesley Sq., Cal. 16\\n      on the 10h April 55 at 4 P.M. Dr. S.K. Das, B.SC., M.B. presided over the\\n      meeting; Sri U. Mukherji, I.P., Commissioner of Police, Calcutta,\\n      inaugurated the function; Justice P. Mullick, Calcutta High court was the\\n      Chief Guests; and Dr. W.S. Barlingay, PH.D. M.P., Ex-Health Minister,\\n      Madhya Pradesh was a distinguished visitor. About 400 persons attended the\\n      meeting.\\n      \\n The function started with garlanding a\\n      portrait of Hahnemann. Sri Upananda Mukherji, in his inaugural address,\\n      paid his respectful homage to the sacred memory of Hahnemann. He pointed\\n      out that the best way of showing respect to this illustrious personage is\\n      to carry the message of Homoeopathy to the farthest corners of our\\n      country. That Homoeopathy has established itself in our country and is\\n      brought to service of millions of suffering people, rich and poor,\\n      bespeaks of its therapeutic efficacy and immortalises Hahnemann as one of\\n      the greatest benefactors of mankind. He held that Homoeopathy is rich with\\n      immense potentialities; and intensive research works ought to be\\n      undertaken to enlarge its scope and sphere of applicability in the field\\n      of medicine in all its aspects.\\n      \\n In his address as the chief Guest,\\n      Justice Mullick deplored that under present circumstances the greatness of\\n      a man of nation is being commonly judged by militaristic achievements in\\n      the background of discovery of atomic weapons of destruction on an\\n      inconceivably mass scale. But the memory of the Savant whose birthday was\\n      being celebrated, is associated with attempts to alleviate the miseries of\\n      people through death, disease and incapacity. Service to humanity is one\\n      of the keynotes of Indian culture. As a great humanitarian Hahnemanns name\\n      is enshrined in the heart of India for all ages to come.\\n      \\n Dr. J. Ghose, M.A., PH D., F.N.I.\\n      welcomed the gathering and in an erudite speech dwelt on some aspects of\\n      Homoeopathy.\\n      \\n Dr. W.S. Barlingay, in a neat speech,\\n      dwelt at length about the fundamental tennets of Homoeopathy. He pointed\\n      out that Hahnemanns philosophy had many points common to our Indian\\n      philosophy, especially of the Vedantic school.\\n      \\n He is having a feeling that the time is\\n      ripe for the advent of an Avatar in Medicine who will synthesise different\\n      systems of medicine, current in our country.\\n      \\n Dr. S.K. Das, in his presidential\\n      address, presented the salient features in Hahnemanns personality and\\n      character. In delineating the life - story of Hahnemann he justified that\\n      Hahnemann was a genius and a saint amongst the physicians that the world\\n      has ever produced. Though a century and a half old, Homoeopathy has\\n      already encompassed the world and is going to occupy its rightful place in\\n      every country.\\n      \\n Dr. J.N. Majumdar gave a hearty vote of\\n      thanks to the President and others and envisaged a bright future for\\n      Homoeopathy.\\n      \\n The All India Homoeopathic convention.\\n      \\n On the occasion of the Hahnemann\\n      Bi-centennial Celebration the Bengal Homoeopathic Institute organised the\\n      All India Homoeopathic Convention which was held at Moslem Institute on\\n      the 11th April 55.\\n      \\n Dr. W.S. Barlingay presided over the\\n      Convention; and Dr. B.K. Sarkar, M.B., D.M.S. was the chairman of the\\n      Reception Committee.\\n      \\n DR. Barlingay, in his presidential\\n      address, expressed his regret that the Govt. of India had not given much\\n      of its mind to implementing the 7-point programme in respect of\\n      Homoeopathy which has been drawn up under the first Five - Year Plan by\\n      the Planning commission. He announced that to bring pressure upon the\\n      Govt. of India, an All India Society for the Advancement of Homoeopathy\\n      (the members consisting of 18 M.P.s and many supporters of Homoeopathy\\n      with Sri S.K. Patil of Bombay as Chairman) had also been set up. Its main\\n      efforts will be to raise sufficient funds to start a fully - equipped\\n      Degree - course Homoeopathic College - cum - Hospital on an All India\\n      basis.\\n      \\n He remarked that some dishonest dealers\\n      in Homoeopathic medicine and some narrow - minded people connected with\\n      Homoeopathy stood in the way of the spread of this system of medicine. The\\n      Homoeopathic profession should try to get rid of them. Those who loved\\n      Homoeopathy must come forward and unitedly move for its spread and for\\n      setting up an ideal Homoeopathic Institute. Experienced practitioners must\\n      also put their heads together and draw up a syllabus for Graduate course\\n      in Homoeopathy. He thanked Dr. J.N. Majumdar, a member of the Ad Hoc\\n      committee, who with the help of his colleagues prepared such a draft\\n      syllabus and has got it approved by the said committee of which the\\n      Director General of Health Services, Ministry of Health, Govt. of India,\\n      is the chairman. Good Homoeopathic Hospitals and efficient practitioners\\n      alone would be able to make Homoeopathy popular. Homoeopathy, it should be\\n      remembered, provided the cheapest medical treatment.\\n      \\n Dr. B.K. Sarkar, Chairman of the\\n      Reception Committee said that the establishment of fully - equipped\\n      Homoeopathic institutions (College - cum - Hospital) was an imperative\\n      necessity for enhancing the prestige of the Homoeopathic profession and\\n      for convincing the people about the therapeutic efficacy of this system of\\n      treatment. He said that one of the great obstacles in the way of the\\n      spread of Homoeopathy was the apathy and \"in many cases active\\n      antagonism\" of the Government, both at the centre and at least in\\n      some of the States. It was because the Medical Directorates were manned\\n      solely by Allopathic doctors. He held that the opposition to Homoeopathy\\n      was not wholly scientific but rather of commercial nature on the part of\\n      the drug - tradesmen. The public should also be educated in the matter of\\n      fundamentals of Homoeopathy. He urged the profession to shake off their\\n      indolence and complacence and to take up concrete constructive works in\\n      immediate future if they want to hold their own as a professional entity.\\n      \\n Several resolutions were moved from the\\n      chair and passed unanimously by the House.\\n      \\n Resolutions passed at the All Indian\\n      Homoeopathic Convention on 11-4-55.\\n      \\n 1. Resolved that this Homoeopathic\\n      convention requests the Central Government and those State Governments who\\n      have not yet recognised the Homoeopathic system of treatment by\\n      legislative enactments, to take immediate steps for passing relevant acts\\n      for the purpose of ensuring proper standardisation of Homoeopathic\\n      teaching, and for securing rights and privileges of Homoeopathic\\n      Practitioners equal to those which are, at present, enjoyed by the\\n      Allopathic Physicians; and as well as for granting adequate help from the\\n      Central and State Governments, Financial or otherwise, for the development\\n      and spread of Homoeopathy in our country.\\n      \\n 2. Resolved that this Homoeopathic\\n      convention requests the Central Government for immediate establishment of\\n      the Central Council of Homoeopathic Medicine by statutory Central Council\\n      of Homoeopathic Medicine by Statutory enactments which will function as a\\n      Central Co-ordinating body for taking decisions on all matter relating to\\n      teaching and practice of Homoeopathy on an All - India basis, the\\n      necessity for which has already been recommended by the Homoeopathic\\n      Enquiry Committee, Third Health Ministers Conference, Planning Commission\\n      and the Ad Hoc Committee set up by the Director General of Health\\n      Services, Ministry of Health, Government of India.\\n      \\n 3. Resolved that this convention\\n      requests the Central Government to establish at least one model\\n      Homoeopathic Medical College in India with a fully equipped and up - to -\\n      date Hospital attached therewith.\\n      \\n 4. Resolved that this convention\\n      requests the Central Government to incorporate Registered Homoeopathic\\n      Practitioners from all States in the Health Personnel Scheme to solve the\\n      problem of adequate supply of medical relief to the teeming masses of\\n      India especially in rural areas.\\n      \\n 5. Resolved that this convention\\n      requests the Central and State Governments to open Homoeopathic Health\\n      Centers and Homoeopathic Charitable Dispensaries in village and other\\n      suitable places, particularly in the community project; and to introduce\\n      Homoeopathic Health Assistants, Nurses and Homoeopathic Compounders\\n      Training Courses.\\n      \\n 6. Resolved that the Homoeopathic\\n      Practitioners registered in their respective State be utilised in the\\n      State Health Insurance Schemes.\\n      \\n 7. Resolved that this convention\\n      records hereby its most emphatic protest against the move of the Central\\n      Government of India to pass an enactment aimed at prohibiting the practice\\n      of medicine including Homoeopathic, Ayurvedic and Unani systems of\\n      medicines by persons who are not registered as Practitioners of any of\\n      these systems before adequate provings are made and put into effect for\\n      registering all the eligible practitioners of different systems of\\n      medicine in all the States of the Indian Union.', u'Tresorie - HINDRANCES TO THE HOMOEOPATHIC PRESCRIPTION [Hindrances To\\nHomoeopathic Prescription]\\n\\n A.H.Grimmer, M.D.\\n      \\n This subject has been brought before\\n      you many times, but it is of such vital importance to the success of\\n      homoeopathic procedures that constant repetition cannot be too much.\\n      \\n When the homoeopathic doctor has given\\n      much time and labor to taking the case history which is the first great\\n      essential in every good prescription, and then devoted more time and labor\\n      to repertory study and research through the Materia Medica, he cannot\\n      afford to have such a prescription spoiled or interfered with by some\\n      foolish external action the patient, which may nullify the expected\\n      results of all the physicians painstaking efforts and leave both physician\\n      and patient disappointed and discouraged.\\n      \\n With these facts in mind, it behoves\\n      the physician to instruct his patient emphatically that he must refrain\\n      from taking all other drugs such as pain - killers, cathartics, camphor or\\n      menthol in any form, and most important of all he must refrain from food\\n      prepared and cooked in aluminium - ware and its alloys\\n      \\n These injunctions are as important as\\n      are the instructions for a proper diet and the correct amount of drinking\\n      water, proper ventilation and hygienic living, both mentally and\\n      physically.\\n      \\n The control of the mind and emotions\\n      are far more important than the average physician realizes. Many a fine\\n      prescription has had its curative action stopped by a sudden, violent,\\n      emotional upset; shock, grief, anger and fright are often responsible for\\n      the short acting relief of a good prescription that for; a while was doing\\n      very satisfying work toward cure.\\n      \\n We have been told by many doctors who\\n      consider themselves first class homoeopaths that they have seen very few,\\n      if any, of the reactions supposed to follow the administration of the\\n      homoeopathic remedy.\\n      \\n In most of their cases, if the selected\\n      remedy acted for them, it was only in a beneficial way. They have never\\n      seen the return of old symptoms or the sharp aggravation followed by a\\n      long period of well - being on the patients part.\\n      \\n These same men have voiced\\n      disappointment with many cases from which they expected brilliant results\\n      from the prescription that was made. They had taken the case carefully and\\n      fully repertorized it, as well as referred to the Materia Medica for a\\n      confirmation of the selected remedy.\\n      \\n Their final conclusion was that the\\n      time and labor spent in making a homoeopathic prescription for the\\n      uncertain results obtained did not reimburse them for such time and\\n      effort. Many of us have had too many such experiences because we failed to\\n      take note of all the factors and elements, in the case and, either through\\n      ignorance or laziness, neglected to instructs our patients properly so\\n      that the remedy might act smoothly and uninterruptedly.\\n      \\n The most pernicious of these\\n      interruptables is the aluminium toxin, that enters the human system by way\\n      of aluminium cooking utensils and by water polluted with aluminium\\n      chloride which is used to soften hard water. This toxin acts much like one\\n      of the miasms as it must be eradicated from the system before a cure of\\n      the patient is possible. The most certain, rapid antidote for it is\\n      Cadmium oxide in potency, and of course the source of intake of the toxin\\n      must be discontinued. After the poison is removed by the Cadmium oxide,\\n      the remaining symptoms and conditions of the patient may be successfully\\n      attacked by the remedy that is indicated by the totality of remaining\\n      symptoms.\\n      \\n Other interfering agents that are very\\n      prevalent today are the numerous coal tar drugs such as aspirin, anacin,\\n      and numerous others of a similar nature which do not require a physicians\\n      prescription.\\n      \\n The four best general antidotes to the\\n      coal tar drugs are Arnica, Carbo. veg., Lachesis, and Mag. phos. to be\\n      given according to the symptoms present in each individual case.\\n      \\n One more important source of\\n      interference with the homoeopathic remedy is the widespread use of sera\\n      and vaccines as protective agents against acute diseases. The reaction to\\n      these products of disease is often long lasting in its effect and leaves\\n      the victims of this practice sick and suffering.\\n      \\n Thuja is one of our best, if not the\\n      very best and most effective, antidotes against these agents and it helps\\n      to restore the patient to a state of approximate order where other\\n      complementary remedies given according to their indications can finish the\\n      case in a complete cure.\\n      \\n From the preceding observations it is\\n      clear that the homoeopathic physician must be a teacher if he would be a\\n      successful healer. His responsibilities are great and his work tedious and\\n      unending, as the study of remedies in itself is stupendous. Without the\\n      qualities of tireless energy and a devoted faith in his work for the good\\n      of his fellows, he cannot succeed in the realm of cure. If and when he\\n      does obtain the stature of a master prescriber, he will humbly give thanks\\n      to a merciful Providence for the rare privilege of serving in the cause of\\n      true healing.', u'Tresorie - ALL INDIA HOMOEOPATHIC CONVENTION WELCOME ADDRESS [All India\\nHomoeopathic Convention Welcome Address]\\n\\n Mr. President, Friends and Colleagues.\\n      \\n It fills my heart with joy unspeakable\\n      to extend a hearty welcome to you all to this city at this All India\\n      Homoeopathic Convention held on the occasion of Bi-centennial Birth-day\\n      Anniversary of our great Master Hahnemann. This is the city where\\n      Homoeopathy was first introduced by Rajendra Lal Dutta of hallowed memory,\\n      who spent a princely fortune for dissemination of its principles and\\n      practice among his countrymen. This is the city where took place the\\n      dramatic conversion of one of the then medical luminaries of the first\\n      magnitude, to the practice of Homoeopathy under the influence of Rajendra\\n      Lal. I mean Dr. Mahendra Lal Sircar who became the high priest of\\n      Homoeopathy, spread its glory far and wide and gained thereby an\\n      international reputation for himself. This is the city where the\\n      celebrities of Homoeopathy like Dr. Berigny, Dr. Salzar, Dr. P.C.\\n      Majumdar, Dr. D. N. Roy. Dr. Younan, Dr. J.N. Majumdar, Dr. Baridbaran\\n      Mukherji, Dr. S.K. Nag, Dr. A.N. Mukherji, Dr. T.N. Palit, Dr. G.\\n      Dirghangi and a host of other talented physicians practised their\\n      profession with credit and success and held aloft the banner of\\n      Homoeopathy. This is the city where exist pioneer institutions for the\\n      teaching of Homoeopathy. This is the city wherefrom Homoeopathy has spread\\n      to all parts of India and its votaries are doing yeomans service for the\\n      good of the suffering humanity.\\n      \\n We are meeting this evening on a\\n      historic occasion and we have to arrive at decisions which might make or\\n      mar the future history of Homoeopathy in India. It may be that forces of\\n      disruption, destruction and obstruction are at work; it may be that self\\n      and vested interests seem to thwart the smooth progress of Homoeopathy; it\\n      may be that some may seem to play in the hands of the Powers that are not\\n      too sympathetic to the cause of Homoeopathy; it may be that the present\\n      seems to be chaotic and future of Homoeopathy dubious but great is truth\\n      indeed and will prevail. We should not lose heart or throw up the sponge.\\n      Tradition, authority, sectarianism, dogmatism are great obstacles on the\\n      way. But obstacles and difficulties are meant to be fought out and\\n      overcome. Strifes and dissensions, discords and disunities may hamper our\\n      progress but they are nonetheless signs of lifes activities. It is a good\\n      augury that the Homoeopathic profession is shaking off its age - long\\n      slumber and getting more and more conscious of its duties and obligation,\\n      its rights and privileges and of its short - comings and practical\\n      difficulties. The life of Hahnemann is there to encourage us; the\\n      masterful will of his dynamic spirit is there to inspire us to intensify\\n      our activities; his achievements are there to goad us to realise greater\\n      success; and his personality is always before us to take lessons from, in\\n      our life which as Swami Vivekananda puts it, is \"a process of\\n      unfolding and development of a being under circumstances tending to press\\n      it down.\"\\n      \\n That Homoeopathy is a scientific system\\n      of treatment, philosophically sound, logically unimpeachable, practically\\n      highly efficacious in curing the sick and cheap enough to suit the poor\\n      economic condition of the Indian masses - has become a much talked - of\\n      subject in the country. But why is it not spreading sufficiently and\\n      adequately in our motherland or in fact anywhere in the world? Why is our\\n      National Government not still keen on according official recognition to\\n      this superb system of healing art or providing ways and means for its\\n      development and diffusion? Why the public opinion is not gaining strength\\n      enough to put sufficient pressure on our Government to take interest in\\n      it? Why sufficient number of fully equipped Homoeopathic teaching\\n      institutions and hospitals are not growing to turn out adequate number of\\n      fully qualified Homoeopathic physicians in the country?\\n      \\n It is high time that we should draw the\\n      attention of the profession and the laity to provide answers to so many\\n      \"whys\" and to solve the pressing problems in the matter\\n      concerned. On a cursory view it becomes evident that the Homoeopathic\\n      profession, the people and the Government are each individually and\\n      collectively responsible for this impasse.\\n      \\n The so - called Allopathy still\\n      occupies the dominant place in any country, even in the land of birth of\\n      Homoeopathy. It is no wonder that Homoeopathy, being a discovery of merely\\n      a century and a half still lags behind its rival shool. But it is a wonder\\n      of wonders that Homoeopathy has already encompassed the whole world within\\n      such a short period since it was ushered into existence by Hahnemann.\\n      History of man reveals that nowhere a new truth was accepted by him easily\\n      and readily, obsessed as he is with conservatism, tradition, authority and\\n      vested interests. Nonetheless the triumphant march of Homoeopathy with a\\n      such a meteoric speed throughout the length and breadth of the world is a\\n      proof positive of the truth inherent in the system and phenomenal\\n      therapeutic efficacy of this healing art. It is one more glaring instance\\n      of mans love of truth against heavy odds that impede his progress at every\\n      step.\\n      \\n For the propagation of any new truth\\n      and its acceptance by man, in general, the first and foremost condition is\\n      the turning out of sufficient number of persons who have realised the\\n      truth and are adept in the practice of it. This involves establishment of\\n      a sufficient number of teaching institutions which will turn out experts\\n      in the science and art of Homoeopathy; and a sufficient number of\\n      Homoeopathic Hospital where, the efficacy of this system of treatment will\\n      be put to test.\\n      \\n Human knowledge is becoming\\n      unmanageably vast. The appearance of specialists has become indispensable.\\n      So special Hospitals for the treatment of specific types of diseases have\\n      sprung forth elsewhere, e.g. Tuberculosis Hospitals, Cancer Hospitals,\\n      Hospital for Tropical Diseases etc. Because of organisation of these\\n      hospitals people generally think of getting themselves treated in these\\n      institutions. As there are no fully - equipped general Homoeopathic\\n      Hospitals and not to speak of special Homoeopathic Hospitals and not to\\n      speak of special Homoeopathic Hospitals the result is Homoeopathy is not\\n      getting a fair chance of treating those diseases like tuberculosis,\\n      cancer, acute infectious diseases of epidemic type e.g., Small-pox,\\n      Cholera etc. on a large and organised scale. Consequently the general\\n      public cannot keep much faith in this treatment and mostly take recourse\\n      to homoeopathic treatment when the case is \"past all hope and past\\n      all surgery\". Hence the establishment of fully - equipped\\n      Homoeopathic institutions (College - cum - Hospitals) is an imperative\\n      necessity for enhancing the prestige of the Homoeopathic profession and\\n      for convincing the people about the therapeutic efficacy of this system of\\n      treatment. Is it not a pity that Homoeopathy once established its\\n      reputation by treating Cholera cases in this city and now nobody thinks of\\n      this treatment in Cholera cases and rushes the patient to the Allopathic\\n      Hospitals which are especially meant for these types of patients? How can\\n      we hope to gain ground under these circumstances?\\n      \\n The next great obstacle is the apathy\\n      and in many cases active antagonism of our Government, both at the Centre\\n      and at least in some of the State, towards Homoeopathy. The Government is\\n      under the thumb of its medical directorates which are solely manned by\\n      Allopathic doctors. The main reasons for the non - acceptance of the\\n      Homoeopathic system of treatment may be summed up in three words:\\n      tradition, authority and professionalism. Their psychology is easily\\n      understood if it is borne in mind that the conservative inertia of human\\n      mind attempts to reject any new thought will all the means at its\\n      disposal. Another reason is due to vested interests. Even a cursory glance\\n      at the history of origin and spread of Homoeopathy, enables one to find\\n      out that the opposition to this system from the start, was not scientific\\n      but rather of commercial nature on the part of the apothecaries who were\\n      afraid of losing their trade - profits. We regret to note that the Central\\n      Government have not yet implemented a single recommendation put forward by\\n      the Homoeopathic Enquiry Committee, Planning Commission. Third Health\\n      Ministers Conference, Ad Hoc Committee etc. though Homoeopathic Acts have\\n      been passed in the States of Bombay, U.P., Madhya Pradesh, Travancore -\\n      Cochin, Bihar etc. I is curious to note that W. Bengal is the only State\\n      where a Homoeopathic Bill has recently been thrown out by the State\\n      Government.\\n      \\n Another great obstacle is the\\n      psychology of the general mass of population who fail to adopt a proper\\n      philosophical attitude towards Homoeopathy and takes the Homoeopathic\\n      Therapeutic Law as great paradox contrary to common sense. Unless we can\\n      educate the public in the matter, we cannot hope to secure their whole -\\n      hearted support for this system of treatment.\\n      \\n Lack of enthusiasm for constructive\\n      works on the part of the Homoeopathic profession, the apathy of our\\n      Government and hesitancy on the part of the public to accept Homoeopathy\\n      are great obstacles to the spread of this system of treatment in the\\n      country. Unless this vicious circles is broken the progress of Homoeopathy\\n      is bound to be impeded. We have to fight on all fronts if we aspire to\\n      achieve victory in our battle for the cause of Homoeopathy and the\\n      suffering humanity.\\n      \\n But our first necessity as pointed out\\n      by the Soul of India expressing itself through Sri Aurobindo, is: If India\\n      is to survive and do her appointed work in the world, the youth of India\\n      should learn to think, to think on all subjects, to think independently,\\n      fruitfully, going to the heart of things, not stopped by their surface,\\n      free of pre - judgements, shearing sophism and prejudice asunder as with a\\n      sharp sword smiting down obscurantism of all kinds as with a mace of\\n      Bhima.\\n      \\n \"Let our brains no longer, like\\n      European infants, be swathed with swaddling clothes; let it have recover\\n      the free and unbound motion of the Gods, let it have not only the\\n      minuteness but the wide mastery and sovereignty natural to the intellect\\n      of Bharata and easily recoverable by it if it once accustomes itself to\\n      feel its own power and be convinced of its own worth.\\n      \\n \"The old fixed foundations have\\n      been broken up, we are tossing in the waters of a great upheaval and\\n      change. It is no use clinging to the old ice - floes of the past, they\\n      will soon melt and leave their refugees struggling in perilous waters. It\\n      is no use landing ourselves in the infirm bog, neither sea nor good, dry\\n      land of a second - hand Europeanism. We shall only die there a miserable\\n      and unclean death.\\n      \\n \"No we must learn to swim and use\\n      that power to reach the good vessel of unchanging truth; we must land\\n      again on the eternal rock of ages.\"\\n      \\n Yes, we must expand, we must assimilate\\n      whatever is assimilable for our growth. Stagnation and contraction are the\\n      signs of Death. Our knowledge must be aggressive, must diffuse through the\\n      rank and file of the whole Homoeopathic profession if we wish to survive\\n      and perpetuate ourselves; to leave an extensive ignorance either below or\\n      around us is to expose ourselves to the perpetual danger of being\\n      exterminated as a professional entity.\\n      \\n In fine, I welcome you, once again, on\\n      this historic occasion to this historic city to deliberate, to exchange\\n      view points and to come to agreed decisions with regard to our future line\\n      of action in respect of Homoeopathy in all its aspects.', u'Tresorie - PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS [Presidential Address]\\n\\n At the Eleventh Session of the\\n      \\n All India Homoeopathic Conference at\\n      GAYA, 1955.\\n      \\n [Continued from page 18]\\n      \\n Politics in its essence is not a\\n      philosophy of technical ideas, but an art of the immediately practical.\\n      That is exactly what the modern Chinese have eminently understood. We\\n      Indians are about the most legalistic minded race, always looking to\\n      precedents and authorities; and the only man who broke through this in\\n      India was Mahatma Gandhi. He was the greatest statesman of all time in\\n      India because he understood the simple needs of the masses. I asked a\\n      member of the British Embassy who was travelling with me on the boat back\\n      from China what he thought of the modern chinese; and he said that they\\n      had something most uncommon, namely, commonsense. The rulers of New China\\n      are, in my view the greatest statesmen I have seen because they know the\\n      needs of the masses and, as statesmen, act as brokers of ideas, without\\n      whom no bridges can be built between the expert and the multitude. It is\\n      no accident, but an inherent quality of his character, that the specialist\\n      distrusts his fellow specialist when the latter can reach the multitude.\\n      For him the gift of popular explanation is a proof of failure in the grasp\\n      of the discipline. His intensity of gaze makes him suspect the man who can\\n      state the elements of his mystery in general terms. He knows too much of\\n      minute to be comfortable upon the heights of generalisation.\\n      \\n I want to further add, and this is\\n      especially meant for our Government and its bureaucrats, that things done\\n      by Governments must not only appear right to the expert, no matter whether\\n      he comes from America, or Kamaschatka; their consequences must seem right\\n      to the plain and average man. And there is no way of discovering his\\n      judgment save by deliberately seeking it. this, after all, is the really\\n      final test of government; for, at least over any considerable period, no\\n      Government can maintain a special policy which runs counter to the wishes\\n      of the people or which does not show adequate and rapid results. Neither\\n      good - will in the expert nor efficiency in the performance of his\\n      function ever compensates in a state for failure to elicit the interest of\\n      the plain man in what is being done. What can be done is not what the\\n      plain mans scheme of values permits him to think as just. His likes and\\n      dislikes, his indifference and inertia, circumscribe at every stage the\\n      possibilities of administration.\\n      \\n Had our planners and our bureaucracy\\n      thought out these aspects the picture would have been very different,\\n      their attitude towards the basic problems of a resurgent Asia would have\\n      been more realistic; and you and I would not have been more realistic; and\\n      you and I would not have been here gathered today to dissect the strangely\\n      antagonistic policy of the Hon. Health Minister and her Health Ministry to\\n      pieces. For, after all what is it that we are asking of them? All that we\\n      are asking is for them to look first at facts as they stand, sheer, brutal\\n      economic facts of India and Asia and then to build their theories on\\n      facts. The most important fact as Harold Lasky points out is that:\\n      \"We must ceaselessly remember that no body of experts is wise enough,\\n      or good enough, to be charged with the destiny of mankind. Just because\\n      they are experts, the destiny of life is, for them, in constant danger of\\n      being sacrificed to a part; and they are saved from disaster only by the\\n      need of deference to the plain mans commonsense. Indeed, it may come so\\n      far that, as Professor Whitehead wrote: \"The fixed man for the fixed\\n      duty, who in older times was such a godsend, in future will be a public\\n      danger. In a sense, the more expert such fixed people are, the more\\n      dangerous are they likely to be. In order to co-ordinate his specialism\\n      with the sumtotal of human knowledge, he must cease to be an expert, for\\n      the wisdom that is needed for the direction of affairs is not an expert\\n      technique but a balanced equilibrium. It is the knowledge of how to use\\n      men, money and material available in the present and the near visible\\n      future, a faculty of judgment about the practicability of principles under\\n      given situations that matters. It consists not in the possession of\\n      specialised knowledge, but in the power to utilise at the right moment and\\n      in the right directions.\"\\n      \\n All this I have been looking for in our\\n      Rulers and their bureaucracy of experts and have not found them. So of\\n      what use is putting before this ruling class our suggestions even if they\\n      are of the utmost value and based on a realistic approach? And how right\\n      was I, even as far back as 1951, when I warned you all against having too\\n      high hopes that the bureaucratic structure would change or that this\\n      Government would rely, less upon their reactionary bureaucracy and more on\\n      the realistic analysis of facts. Nothing has changed today. On the\\n      contrary, the more it begins to fail the more barren its results turn out\\n      to be, the firmer does this Government clings onto its pre - conceived\\n      notions - a well known escapist phenomena.\\n      \\n Therefore what shall we discuss\\n      further? I think there is something useful I could tell you, mainly that\\n      most of the thesis we have repeatedly put up to this Government, and most\\n      of what I and some of us have been tirelessly and, to the Government,\\n      tiresomely, advocating, quite unknown to us have been put into actual\\n      execution in New China. That was the most surprising thing I and others\\n      saw when we was the most surprising thing I and others saw when we was the\\n      most surprising thing I and others saw when we went there. Namely for\\n      years we have been advocating that went there. Namely for years we have\\n      been advocating that s three years course in medical aid, or even two\\n      years course, is adequate to turn out reasonably efficient practitioners\\n      of medical aid. The Chinese being realists have gone even further. Their\\n      arguments is that there is a difference between practical needs and\\n      academic ideals. They say, what I have been saying since years, that the\\n      basis of a plan is not what is desirable, but what is feasible and\\n      practicable. But then it needs the Chinese realism to do things in a\\n      unorthodox way. They shocked orthodox Marxism into hysterics by doing the\\n      most unheard of and un - Marxist thing. They based their theories on a\\n      peasant revolution and made it a stupendous success. That was the most\\n      unheard of thing the orthodox Marxists with their theory of\\n      \"Dictatorship of the Proletariat\", had ever heard of, not only\\n      in Holy Russia but it came as a shock also to the orthodox Marxists in\\n      India When the Russians first announced their first Five Year Plan, all\\n      the learned orthodox Economists in capitalistic countries dolefully shook\\n      their heads and predicted dire failure. Why? Because it did not fit in\\n      with their fixed theories. To their utter consternation it succeed, again,\\n      in the most unheard of manner. What is the reason for the experts failure\\n      to assess rightly the possibility of success of unorthodox approaches to\\n      problems? As Lasky points out:\\n      \\n \"Vital, too, and dangerous, is the\\n      experts caste spirit. The inability of doctors to see light from without\\n      is notorious; and a reforming lawyer is at least as strange a spectacle as\\n      one prepared to welcome criticism of his profession from men who do not\\n      practise it. There is, in fact, no expert group which does not tend to\\n      deny that ruth may possibly be found outside the boundary of its private\\n      Pyranees. Yet, clearly enough, to accept its dictates as final, without\\n      examining their implications, would be to accept grave error as truth in\\n      almost every department of social effort. Every experts conclusion is a\\n      philosophy of the second best until it has been examined in terms of a\\n      scheme of values not special to the subject matter of which he is an\\n      exponent.\\n      \\n REALISM IN NEW CHINA. This is exactly\\n      what the Chinese understood, without, very likely, ever having read Harold\\n      Lasky, and I am openly confessing that my recent visit to China taught me\\n      in a six weeks of practical observation, what twenty years of theoretical\\n      study could never have effectively taught me. Take for instance their\\n      outlook on Medical and Health Problems. They never had the benefit of\\n      advice from the W.H.O. like our Health Minister. They are lucky that they\\n      did not, because it taught them to think in straight lines without\\n      reference to holy precedents. The first thing I asked the Health Minister\\n      in China, who also happens to be a woman there as here, was what the\\n      attitude of the Government was towards it own indigenous system of\\n      medicine. She said that they could not do without it that China had about\\n      46000 trained medical personnel which was totally inadequate, and they\\n      were conscious of the fact that it would take China considerable time to\\n      create that adequate, highly trained staff in modern medicine; and what\\n      were they to do in the meantime? Obviously, she argued, the Chinese\\n      Government could not let the people die without medical aid when there\\n      were huge number of Chinese medical practitioners in indigenous medicine\\n      who had an ancient system of medicine which the Government had not fully\\n      assessed but knew that the people were resorting to it. She said that both\\n      the Government and the people held the old indigenous system in high\\n      respect and that the Government thought it wise to enlist the aid of these\\n      thousands of indigenous practitioners and give them encouragement to study\\n      their own system better. I told her that I had read about the various\\n      short term courses of training of medical personnel and how she could\\n      substantiate them. In my own heart I was over joyed to find our views\\n      already in picture there, but in order to get more information, I put on\\n      the air of a stern scientific investigator. She told me that these were\\n      merely practical make shifts. Something had to be done at various level\\n      during the period of development of China to a full - fledged, highly\\n      developed country, and obviously, they had to choose between the\\n      essentially practical needs on one hand and academic desirability on the\\n      other. Thus they have devised specific courses for specific purposes, at\\n      specific levels, beginning at the Hsien (Tehsil) level right up to the\\n      modern specialities at the city level. Their courses are 6 months, 1-2-3-4\\n      and 5 years, and each is devised with very clear cut and specific\\n      intentions. They have thrown for the time being the academic ideals out of\\n      the window. They said there is time for that. In interviewed the Dean of\\n      the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Mukden and was astounded to\\n      learn that they did not believe in the teaching of international\\n      nomenclature in anatomy. When I asked why this trend to isolationism, he\\n      said that it was their first intention that China should produce terms\\n      that Chinese could understand in order to become reasonably efficient\\n      practical physicians and to create an army of scientists was not their\\n      primary objective. Scientists they would produce, and for that they would\\n      devise a different type of education. At present their aim was to train\\n      men and women in large numbers, as rapidly as possible, to serve specific\\n      purposes, and for that, they believe that all extraneous and unnecessary\\n      theoretical junk should be excluded. They wanted men and women to learn to\\n      take a practical approach to a known set of problems with a known set of\\n      measures. When Professor Bhagwantham, the famous Indian physicist, was\\n      shocked, as I pretended to be shocked, that people with only a six months\\n      course of training were let loose on Chinese humanity, the same minister\\n      sent for her Director who took Bhagwantham round to the most up-to-date\\n      and largest hospital and showing him the various instruments for diagnosis\\n      and treatment, explained that it needed a full 5 years training in order\\n      to know how to use them.\\n      \\n But, he asked, could China, at present\\n      and for several years to come, afford to send all such equipments to\\n      villages. Obviously no. Then what is the good of sending men to to those\\n      villages when such equipment could not be made available. But all knew the\\n      common - place disease in the countryside and they also knew the simple\\n      remedies with which to combat them. Obviously, it was logical to get men\\n      from those very villages to acquire the necessary minimum training for\\n      specific purposes at specific levels till the economic situation improved,\\n      which was bound to be, but that needed time. So they believed that the\\n      local practising indigenous physician should be enlisted, encouraged to\\n      undergo further training in the elements of new things and he is not\\n      expected to work miracles but is just expected to do his work better than\\n      before. The chinese Government had already had experience during their\\n      resistance against Japan when nothing was available, how to improvise\\n      medical aid out of practically nothing; for example, the famous Eight\\n      Route Army, and even peasants were given elementary training, like the\\n      Feldscherrs in Russia, and they did excellent work. But then, my friends,\\n      the chinese did not have the disadvantage of a highly intellectual Indian\\n      Medical Council with the Burra Saab Mentality, nor the most unscientific,\\n      \"scientific\" trade union known as the Indian Medical\\n      Association. Things had to be done in the easiest, cheapest, quickest and\\n      most practical manner, no matter on whose toes of sensitive private vested\\n      interests they had to tread, and they did it.\\n      \\n Shanghai was the most notorious endemic\\n      focus for cholera before the new Chinese Government took over power. They\\n      did not talk big words like \"Preventive Medicine\", nor did they\\n      consult the W.H.O. they went straight to the point, called upon the people\\n      in a mighty popular campaign to clear up choked sewers and streets, and\\n      week in and week out, bands of enthusiastic young men dredged stinking\\n      sewers and set an example to the people, who at first, distrustful, then\\n      amazed, joined in the work. In short, the old thesis that our former\\n      National Planning Committee had put up, alas, not followed by the present\\n      Planners, that \"whatever measures we may take, it must be\\n      understandable to the people and must appear as if it comes from their own\\n      endeavours\", has been put into practice by the chinese. In short, let\\n      us be happy. The practical proof you and I have been looking for in all\\n      our proposals to our present Government in India, has been supplied in\\n      ample measure by New China. Just recently a delegation of Engineers went\\n      to China from India and they came back with the report that the Chinese\\n      did the same things we did, but much cheaper in spite of the fact that we\\n      had more machines. Why? Because they know how to enlist man power and has\\n      a definite clear cut purpose. Yes, Friends, I myself saw a huge building\\n      of 400 rooms going up to be completed in 5 weeks; and who were building\\n      it? The students of the Mukden Technical Institute under the supervision\\n      of the masons. Imagine such a thing happening in India? It will be damned\\n      good idea and India will be far the better for it.\\n      \\n Now the question, the very pertinent\\n      question is should India follow the Chinese example? Are the conditions in\\n      China to which such methods of solution were applied identical with ours\\n      or at least similar? My answer is a most emphatic yes. I say this after\\n      considerable study. Most of the visitors to China from India after a brief\\n      visit imagined themselves full - bloomed authorities on China and have\\n      even delivered themselves in print. I did not emulate their precious\\n      example, but on the contrary sat down to read more books on China from\\n      various aspects and till now I have read nearly 40 books on China from\\n      wherever I could borrow them and the more I study the problems of china I\\n      feel that at least in the economic approach, there is much to learn from\\n      China, not because of their practical approach, not only because\\n      theoretically we came to the same conclusion as the Chinese did, but\\n      because those very views we hold, have been proved eminently correct and\\n      successful.\\n      \\n But again the recurring question\\n      arises: Will our Health Ministry and our present Government realise this?\\n      My answer is no. It is not as if the Health bureaucrats are unaware of the\\n      force of public opinion is pressing for recognition of the other systems\\n      of medicine in India. Take for instance the redoubtable Dr. K.C.K.E. Raja.\\n      On page 295 of the Chopra Committee Report, Vol 2, he admits.\\n      \\n \"There is considerable force in\\n      those arguments and they can be met only by an acceptance of the position\\n      that indigenous medicine will have to be utilised under present conditions\\n      to promote a rapid extension of health services\".\\n      \\n But how do they intend to stab all this\\n      in the back? Very simple, dear friends, very simple. Just get the Indian\\n      Medical Council and the Health Ministers Conference to go back on their\\n      previous recommendations and make Ayurveda a Five Years Course.\\n      Homoeopathy, D. Raja at least is honest as compared to Dr. Satish Sen, for\\n      he admits he knows about Homoeopathy only from Goulds Medical Dictionary,\\n      is recommended as a \"post - graduate\" or 4 years course, and I\\n      happen to know from inside sources, how Dr. Raja smuggled himself into the\\n      meeting of the Council in his \"PRIVATE CAPACITY\", to make vital\\n      proposal to upset previous decisions and what General Thaper (now happily\\n      retired from doing further damage) said and I know many things which the\\n      bureaucrats imagine I do not know as to inner working of the Government.\\n      All this has been clothed with the sanctimonious desire of raising the\\n      standard of medical education in all systems of of medicine. But who has\\n      any quarrel with the desire for the highest standards of training? But\\n      what is the purposefulness of that under present conditions, when we know\\n      that we can have more than adequate results at a much less expenditure, in\\n      a shorter time? It is intellectual tomfoolery at best; in reality, a\\n      sinister purpose masquerading under the garb of academic idealism. So\\n      seven the recommendations of the Planning Committee have been thrown to\\n      the winds; and, where I am positively convinced, and I am qualified to\\n      speak on it, that on an average a two years course will give us a large\\n      number of reasonably trained auxiliary personnel, these academic\\n      idealists, intend to sabotage all these steps by their latest decisions.\\n      \\n Personally, I do not expect either the\\n      Health Bureaucrats nor the Health Minister to take any other attitude than\\n      what they have done. With tears in her eyes the Health Minister has\\n      complained that she is not being given enough money for all her fanciful\\n      ideas. Like the late lamented empress, Marie Antoinette, she will give her\\n      people nothing if she cannot give them fruit cake made by the most\\n      fashionable confectioner in London or at least Delhi. But our masses are\\n      used to plain bread and not cakes and do not expect cakes or confetti but\\n      just something simple.\\n      \\n What then are we to do? Obviously we\\n      shall have to turn to the final arbiters of our destiny and the destiny of\\n      our country - the people. Let us put our plans before our people; let us\\n      show them that Chinese practice has proved our contentions as justified,\\n      let us ignore this Government and its bureaucrats and realise that much of\\n      our own failure has been due to our lack of unity. I am painfully aghast\\n      at the disunity not only among the Homoeopaths, but in the so - called\\n      progressive forces in this country. To my sorrow, it seems to be a\\n      characteristic of the progressive forces in this country to have more\\n      schisms and divisions in their ranks than the reactionary forces in this\\n      country. This applies also to political parties. The reactionary forces\\n      are at least realistic. They know they are fighting for their own\\n      survival. We so - called progressive are still in the realms of\\n      ideological idealism. Theories and ideologies have no value for me unless\\n      they are related to practicability. Correct politics is to see the reality\\n      and to adapt ideologies to practical realities. Obviously it does not lie\\n      in our power today to either reform our bureaucracy or to eliminate them.\\n      When I asked a Chinese statesman how the Chinese reformed their\\n      bureaucracy he replied, \"We did not reform our bureaucracy, we\\n      eliminated them\". Obviously just at present neither you nor I have\\n      the power to do so. But their is just one possibility. Our ruling class\\n      might open their eyes and, instead of becoming rubber stamps to their\\n      bureaucracy, start doing some hard thinking and instruct their bureaucracy\\n      to either carry out policies given to them or get out. Ah, but that, my\\n      friends, is just wishful thinking on our part.\\n      \\n I believe, that the only road open to\\n      us is to convince the people. We have to become the brokers of ideas today\\n      between the people and the Government, and the greater our success in\\n      convincing the people, the greater will be our success in forcing the\\n      Government; for no Government however powerful it be, can carry out a\\n      policy for long, that neither enlists the co - operation of the people,\\n      nor shows adequate results. And if the present government does show\\n      results, our question is, at what cost? Any idiot can draw up a\\n      magnificent plan going into thousands of crores. Genius lies in achieving\\n      that same objective and results at one fifth of the coast. J.B. Grant, one\\n      of the wisest foreigners I have had the privilege of meeting here in\\n      India, has laid down that India, and Asia in general, must strive to\\n      achieve at the coast of one rupee that which wealthier countries get at\\n      the cost of seven rupees. Well, tell that to our Government and our\\n      Planners and ask them to show us the way if they can. Take it from me,\\n      despite Sri Jawaharlals boundless enthusiasm, I have studied the plan and\\n      cannot share it with him. Enthusiasm is a good thing but you must know\\n      what to enthuse over. One cannot have the same enthusiasm after ginger -\\n      pop as after Champagne. But I must not say that. This is supposed to be a\\n      dry country - very dry.\\n      \\n So, having said all that I had to say,\\n      I realise that I have taken a great deal of your time. There is a homely\\n      saying of Aristotle that \"the guest will judge better of a feast than\\n      the cook\". I unfortunately happen to be the cook and judgment is\\n      yours.\\n      \\n Finally, before taking leave of you, I\\n      feel I must tell you that very likely the coming two years may turn out to\\n      be the most crucial epoch in Indias future shape of things to come. We\\n      shall therefore have to go on fighting, continually watching how to\\n      improve our own approach to the vital problems of India, not only\\n      regarding public health, but also all other aspects pertaining to the\\n      welfare of the masses, always be willing to accept our own mistakes, and\\n      like my late revered father, one of the wisest and most scientific\\n      physicians I have had the privilege to work under, never be afraid to\\n      revise a mistaken diagnosis. That is how we learn.\\n      \\n I thank you all for the patient hearing\\n      you have given me and as far as shall be able to in the future, allow me\\n      to serve you and our cause as best as I can.\\n      \\n HOMOEOPATHS REMEMBER FOUNDER\\n      \\n Yesterday Homoeopaths in Ceylon\\n      gathered at the G.O.H. to celebrate the second centenary of the founder of\\n      Homoeopathy, Dr. Samuel Hahnemann at a luncheon held by the Homoeopathic\\n      Association of Ceylon.\\n      \\n The chief guest at the centenary lunch\\n      was DR.

Ghosh, M.A., PH.D., F.N.I.\\n      \\n Chairman, Reception Committee.\\n      \\n Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen,\\n      \\n We have met here to-day to pay our\\n      homage to the memory of Christian Friedrich Samuel Hahnemann, who was born\\n      in 1755, just two hundred years ago. I think it is not necessary for me to\\n      go into the details of the extraordinary career of this great man, who was\\n      a linguist, a physician, a scientist, a clinical researcher of the first\\n      rank and a faithful and conscientious servant of God and man. You all know\\n      the struggles and tribulations of his life and also how he ultimately\\n      succeeded in convincing the world of his medical theories.\\n      \\n So far as India is concerned, the\\n      earliest recorded case of homoeopathic treatment appear to be the\\n      treatment of Raja Ranjit Singh of Lahore in 1839. According to a report,\\n      reproduced in the Homoeopathic Herald, Calcutta, submitted by the late Dr.\\n      Mahendralal Sircar to the Homoeopathic Congress held in London in 1881,\\n      John Martin Honigberger practised in Calcutta for some years upto 1860 and\\n      was known as a cholera doctor. His successes in homoeopathic treatment\\n      drew the attention of Raja Ranjit singh, who, though unwilling at first,\\n      placed himself under the treatment of Honigberger against vehement\\n      opposition from his Court physicians. The Raja improved considerably under\\n      the homoeopathic treatment and was so pleased that he presented to\\n      Honigberger a pair of heavy gold armlets and a pair of expensive Kashmir\\n      shawls. This added fuel to the fire of jealousy of the Court Vaids and\\n      Hakims, who ultimately managed to wrest the distinguished patient from the\\n      hands, of the foreigner and succeeded in sending him to the other world.\\n      \\n Since the time of Honigberger, the\\n      progress of homoeopathy in Bengal during the latter half of the nineteenth\\n      century was marked by the continued enthusiasm for homoeopathy both in the\\n      amateurs and professionals. In this connection we may mention the names of\\n      Mr. E. de Latour of the Indian Civil Service, Maulvie Zianuddin Hossain of\\n      the same department. Dr. C.F. Tonniere, M.D., Babu Rajendra Dutt and Dr.\\n      Thiennette Berigny. The conversion of Dr. Mahendralal Sircar, M.D, D.L.,\\n      C.I.E., to homoeopathy in 1867 marked the beginning of a prosperous era in\\n      the history of homoeopathy in Bengal. Amongst the prominent homoeopaths of\\n      this time were Dr. Leopold Salzer, Dr. Preonath Bose and Dr. Gobinda\\n      Chandra Ray. The year 1878 witnessed a very unhappy incident. Dr.\\n      Mahendralal Sircar who was a member of the Faculty of Medicine of the\\n      Calcutta University was practically forced to resign on account of his\\n      conversion to homoeopathy. Dr. Sircars learned and dignified letters in\\n      this connection are regarded as invaluable gems in the homoeopathic\\n      literature. Dr. Sircar was a genuine worshipper of science. It was he who\\n      founded the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science. A man of\\n      his calibre certainly did not surrender to quackery! Since Dr. Sircars\\n      time, up to the present day, the study and practice of homoeopathy have\\n      steadily progressed through the following decades not only in Bengal, but\\n      also in other provinces.\\n      \\n I shall not inflict on you a long\\n      speech, elaborating the various aspects of the principles of homoeopathy,\\n      as propounded by Hahnemann, as I am sure, you are all familiar with them.\\n      I shall, however, say just a few words regarding the scientificity of the\\n      law of similars and the therapeutic value of high potencies, the two main\\n      points, which are supposed to be crucial by the opponents of homoeopathy.\\n      Every scientific principle proceeds on the basis of the enquiry, how? When\\n      one step has been explained, we ask the same question, how? We go on like\\n      this, until we are forced to a halt and compelled to accept certain\\n      assumptions, which cannot or need not be proved. Take any proposition of\\n      geometry. It is proved by the preceding propositions, which in their turn,\\n      are proved by earlier propositions, We go on like this and come to a halt\\n      at the axioms and postulates which have to be assumed. The truth of these\\n      assumptions are not proved by simpler propositions, but they are true,\\n      because they yield results which are true. If we find that the results\\n      derived from them are not true, the assumptions will also be false. As a\\n      matter of fact, this has happened in the case of geometry. After Enclids\\n      geometry had reigned supreme for about two thousand year, it was\\n      discovered by Lobatcheffsky that the postulate of parallels could not be\\n      accepted as a general truth and this led to the discovery of non -\\n      Euclidean geometry. In a similar manner, every branch of science\\n      ultimately depends on one or more assumptions which cannot be proved. Let\\n      me take the example of the law of gravitation, which is certainly a\\n      scientific law, regarded as a universal law of nature. The law is this:\\n      Any two masses m and m situated at a distance r apart, attract each other\\n      with a force varying directly as the product of the masses and inversely\\n      as the square of the distance, i.e., the force is k mm/r2, why is it mm\\n      and not (mm)2? Why is it inverse square and not inverse cube? Then again\\n      how is the force created? How is it that the force is absolutely\\n      independent of the medium separating them. It may be vacuum, or air, or\\n      water, or glass, or steel, or flint, but the force is the same. It is not\\n      affected by cold or heat or by rest or motion. Can you imagine anything\\n      more arbitrary? The top - ranking scientists of the world have racked\\n      their brains for three centuries to find out the why or how of the law,\\n      but their efforts have failed. Still we have regarded it as a universal\\n      law. Why? Because it has led to results which are true. It has explained\\n      the fall of the apple to the ground, the motion of a particle down an\\n      inclined plane, the motion of a particle projected in air, the motion of\\n      the pendulum of a clock, the motion of water through pipes, the motion of\\n      water in rivers and canals, the tidal waves of seas, the motion of the\\n      moon round the earth, the motion of the earth and other planets round the\\n      sun and so on. the truth of the deductions is the basis of the truth of\\n      the assumptions. The revolutionary ideas of Einstein regarding space and\\n      time, have totally dispensed with the gravitational force, butt hat is\\n      quite another story, into which I shall not enter. The point is that the\\n      law of gravitation, though perfectly arbitrary and incapable of proof, has\\n      been regarded a universal fundamental law, only because it has led to\\n      results which are true.\\n      \\n Let me come to medicine. The juice of\\n      calendula leaves has a favourable action on cuts or wounds. This is a\\n      truth. It has been known to man for many centuries. We may not yet know\\n      why or how this happens, but it is a fact. Some attribute it to the\\n      chlorofill contained in the juice, some to other properties. Even if we do\\n      not known why or how, the juice will not cease to have its effect. So long\\n      as it has its effect, it is perfectly scientific to use it. Let us extend\\n      our ideas a little and consider the law of similars. It is a law which has\\n      been proved in innumerable cases through years and years. The phenomenon\\n      of a hand scotched by heat being relieved by heat is not a got-up\\n      concoction. It is a physiological fact much more convincing than the\\n      motion of the moon round the earth. It is not unlikely that the law of\\n      similars might, in future, be merged into some other law of wider\\n      significance, but the law will be there. Its basis is far stronger than\\n      the basis of Newtons law. Unless God chooses to remodel the fundamental\\n      physiological and biological make - up of the human body, the law of\\n      similars will remain a universal law.\\n      \\n As regards the action of high\\n      potencies, in addition to the practical therapeutics results, attempts are\\n      being made to understand the phenomenon by modern scientific methods. The\\n      researches of Boyd and others have gone a long way and we may expect, in\\n      future, a better clarification of the issue. In the mean time the obvious\\n      therapeutic results obtained by the application of these drugs on patients\\n      are quite enough to justify its scientificity.\\n      \\n Before I take may seat, I will just\\n      request the audience not merely to concern themselves with the theories\\n      and principles, but also to the proper administration of the drugs. They\\n      should not only adopt the medical principles advocated by the great\\n      Hahnemann, but also try to attain his ethical standard. In every system of\\n      medicine, whether it is homoeopathy or otherwise the relation of the\\n      physician and the patient is not merely the relation of a shop - keeper\\n      and customer, though, in ordinary life, there is always need of give - and\\n      - take on both sides. Just as the profession of teaching ought to be above\\n      mere shop - keeping, so the profession of attending to the sick and\\n      supplying him with proper medicines, should also be regarded as a very\\n      sacred duty, to be performed with the greatest care and with the clearest\\n      conscience.\\n      \\n It is necessary that the teaching and\\n      practice of homoeopathy and also the manufacture of drugs should be under\\n      the strictest scientific control. Whatever may be the nature or\\n      constitution of the controlling body, it is essential that the supervision\\n      should be thorough. This is true not merely for homoeopathy but also for\\n      any other system of medicine, practised for the purpose of healing the\\n      sick.\\n      \\n With these words, I pay my deep and\\n      sincere respects to the late Samuel Hahnemann, one of the greatest\\n      geniuses of modern times. Jai Hind!.', u'Tresorie - Editorial THE PROBLEM OF SMALL - POX VACCINATION [Editorial -\\nProblem Of Small Pox Vaccination]\\n\\n 1. The whole problem of prophylaxis in\\n      uncertain and complicated. No system of medicine has yet gathered\\n      knowledge enough to speak on the subject with dogmatism and authority.\\n      Statistical records provided by the so - called modern scientific medicine\\n      on the subject betray many fallacies, loop - holes and irrationalities\\n      when they are reviewed with a critical eye and an unbiased scientific\\n      mental attitude. It is very difficult - nay, almost impossible - to apply\\n      the most recent and advanced methods of statistical analysis in matters\\n      biological; and medicine is certainly a department of human biology. In\\n      this connection we request our readers to go through two memorable books\\n      of G.B. Shaw, viz., Doctors Dilemma and Doctors Delusions. On perusal of\\n      those writings it will be easily evident that the claim of reducing the\\n      mortality and preventing incidence of Small - pox infection, solely by the\\n      introduction and use of cow - lymph, is wholly unwarranted and certainly\\n      debatable.\\n      \\n 2. With the advance of human knowledge\\n      regarding public health, sanitation and standard of living the incidence\\n      of many other infectious diseases (besides small - pox) in epidemic form\\n      and mortality rate due to those diseases have progressively decreased.\\n      Evidences are not wanting that no country has ever been depopulated with\\n      small - pox before Jenners discovery or that serious epidemics of small -\\n      pox have occurred in place inspite of mass vaccination being resorted to.\\n      So the prophylactic claim of cow - lymph vaccination is still an open\\n      question.\\n      \\n 3. It is admitted on all hands that bad\\n      and sometimes dangerous or fatal after effects do occur after inoculating\\n      healthy persons or children with Vaccine for prevention and protection\\n      from small pox.\\n      \\n 4. Since 1948 State Law for compulsory\\n      vaccination against small - pox has been repealed in the United Kingdom of\\n      British Isles - but records do not prove either that the incidence of\\n      small - pox epidemic has increased in severity or that the mortality -\\n      rate due to small - pox has gone up there.\\n      \\n 5. Homoeopathy is not opposed to\\n      vaccination on principle. But it is opposed to the method of using\\n      Vaccination as being a violation of sound, natural principles of\\n      medication and potentially productive of serious injury to the living\\n      organism. It has been proved experimentally and clinically that such\\n      methods as taken recourse to by the \"allopaths\", are unnecessary\\n      and that the results claimed by their advocates can be attained more\\n      safely, more rapidly and more thoroughly by the administration of\\n      homoeopathically indicated medicines in sub - physiological doses through\\n      natural channels of the body than by introducing it forcibly by means of\\n      hypodermic needle or otherwise.\\n      \\n 6. Though the dominant method of using\\n      vaccination is likely to be attended with bad sequelae, either immediate\\n      or remote it cannot be asserted or justified that every case of\\n      vaccination will be followed by undesirable after - effects. It depends on\\n      individualisation of cases; and we have to carry on further investigations\\n      on the point. So we so neither advocate for indiscriminate mass\\n      vaccination nor stand for wholesale condemnation of vaccination. The\\n      present limitation of our knowledge regarding this problem forbids us to\\n      be dogmatic.\\n      \\n 7. Dr. Burnett and many others have\\n      shown that the ill - effects of vaccination are very similar to the\\n      symptoms of sycosis. This is our individualising factor. A sycotic patient\\n      has the potentiality of manifesting undesirable symptoms following\\n      vaccination. The symptoms of sycosis are known and we might therefore be\\n      careful to study the constitution of persons, both young and adult, to\\n      avoid disaster.\\n      \\n 8. Many distinguished Homoeopaths have\\n      claimed prophylactic properties of various remedies prepared in a\\n      homoeopathic way. But all of these have stopped short of just naming the\\n      remedies. Nobody has left definite instructions about the potencies and\\n      frequencies in which a particular drug has to be used or about any certain\\n      method of testing the development of immunity acquired by administration\\n      of such homoeopathic remedies. Here the homoeopathic doctors differ and\\n      from a practical point of view one is at a loss as to what to do. This is\\n      one great handicap from the prophylactic point of view. Very often\\n      homoeopaths and person undergoing homoeopathic prophylaxis might live\\n      under a false sense of security in time of epidemics!\\n      \\n 9. To state a few instructions, so far\\n      gathered from the current homoeopathic literature:\\n      \\n (a) Dr. Schmidt referred to a French\\n      Homoeopath who experimentally demonstrated that higher he went up in\\n      potency the longer the immunity as proved by the Shick test. He further\\n      said that the 9,000th potency would give an immunity of about eight years.\\n      The 1,000th potency would give approximately only 22 years protection and\\n      a lower one, a 30th, would give protection only for a few months.\\n      \\n (b) Dr. Grimmer is of opinion that the\\n      10M is a protective potency and the reaction is good at least for that\\n      epidemic; and if there comes another epidemic and the people want further\\n      protection, he repeats the process only for the epidemic.\\n      \\n (c) Dr. Tyler of England advocated the\\n      administration of remedies is successively higher potencies, viz., 1M, 10M\\n      and CM at an interval of 12 hours.\\n      \\n (d) The writer of this article can\\n      testify that he observed symptoms of feverishness, malaise and pain in the\\n      back and extremities in himself and his son and daughter after\\n      administration of Variolinum 10M twelve hours after the use of Variolinum\\n      1M. during an epidemic of small-pox in Calcutta.\\n      \\n 10. Our considered opinion is that use\\n      of potentized homoeopathic remedies for prophylactic purposes is enough in\\n      cases where small - pox has broken out in an epidemic form and it is not\\n      desirable to use prophylactic medicines either in a homoeopathic or\\n      allopathic way, as a routine measure whether there is an epidemic or not.\\n      But when the epidemic has broken out in a severe form or when contact with\\n      a small - pox patient is unavoidable our advice is to take homoeopathic\\n      medicine at first and to be doubly sure to take vaccination afterwards.\\n      Thus we feel bound to compromise ourselves because of our limitation in\\n      knowledge and want of having a method to test immunity after the\\n      administration of homoeopathic prophylactic remedies. Human life is too\\n      precious to make it a prey to our so - called scientific dogmatisms. We\\n      admit from our experience that crude form of vaccination goes a great way\\n      to lessen the virulence of infection in an already infected person or to\\n      avoid dangerous complications of this fell disease viz., Corneal ulcer,\\n      opacity and blindness etc. So under these circumstances of severe epidemic\\n      outbreaks of small - pox we advise or support vaccination for those who\\n      had no primary vaccination; and advise the trial of homoeo - prophylaxis\\n      first to those who had received primary vaccination to be followed by\\n      crude vaccination in order not to take any chance for receiving protection\\n      with the means known to us and at our disposal. Saving of life should be\\n      of prior importance to that of the possibility of any bad after effect\\n      following vaccination.\\n      \\n 11. Some advocate for the discovery of\\n      a homoeopathic remedy suited to the \"genus epidemicus\" affecting\\n      a locality. But there is one practical drawback in such a procedure. We\\n      have to wait till the epidemic actually sets in and a number of lives are\\n      sacrificed in the first flood - tide of an epidemic outbreak. And it is a\\n      known fact that mortality rate is highest in the first phase of any\\n      Epidemic.\\n      \\n Some advocate for studying individual\\n      constitution and selection and administration of suitably indicated\\n      homoeopathic remedies for each case before the expected outbreak of an\\n      Epidemic. But it is not at all practicable to take recourse to such a\\n      procedure in a modern city of millions of population.\\n      \\n 12. There are two ways in which\\n      Homoeopathy can assist in any Epidemic:\\n      \\n Though administration of drugs\\n      homoeopathically is not possible till symptoms manifest themselves and\\n      disease is established, it has been found however that practically certain\\n      Homoeopathic remedies do also exert a prophylactic action. Certain\\n      symptoms are anticipated, as it were, and assumed to take a certain\\n      course, then a remedy which pictures this syndrome can be given with every\\n      chance of benefit e.g., prophylactic administration of Belladonna in\\n      Sydenhams smooth Scarlatina (vide pp 115, foot - note 17, Organon 6th\\n      Edition.). Homoeopaths make use of a great deal of inadvertent preventive\\n      medicine in their daily round of practice due to the abortive effects of\\n      the clearly prescribed remedy.\\n      \\n (a) So, one way is by administering an\\n      immunising agent by way of the mouth, potentized like other homoeopathic\\n      remedies, and selected for its similarity with the particular form of the\\n      epidemic.\\n      \\n (b) Second way by elevating the patient\\n      to that higher level of health which bestowes the utmost general immunity\\n      and the greatest power of recuperation. This is accomplished as a matter\\n      of course through chronic treatment. The action of this constitutional\\n      remedy (not by any means the same for everybody) is to cure morbid\\n      tendencies, to build resistive powers, to bestow power of recovery, and\\n      thus to promote the highest general immunity.\\n      \\n The best public health is the sum total\\n      of individual healths. Health is not merely a state of being. It is power.\\n      Health is power to resist, power to recover, power to adapt life to\\n      conditions without fear, the power to liver a full life in the world. The\\n      aim of Homoeopathy is to build that power.\\n      \\n The constitutional remedy is the best\\n      protection not only against small - pox; therefore, it is the higher level\\n      of health to which Homoeopathy can lift its patients. \"The right\\n      constitutional remedy is worth as an immuniser than all the specific\\n      Decoctions that could be packed in a ship.\"\\n      \\n It is not vaccination at all but can be\\n      called the ideal and internal vaccination.\\n      \\n So long Homoeopathy has never been\\n      given a chance to be used for public health purposes by any Government of\\n      any country. It would have immunised people against all sorts of epidemic\\n      diseases and would have avoided all the ill - effects, immediate and\\n      remote, from crude processes of vaccination and inoculation as they are\\n      practised now.', u'Tresorie - PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS [Presidential Address]\\n\\n THE ROLE OF HOMOEOPATHY IN THE SECOND\\n      \\n By ALVA BENJAMIN, M.B.CH.B., F.F.HOM.\\n      \\n Such a system of medicine must\\n      recognize that it is as much an art as a science, and that healing is a\\n      relationship between two living personalities. It must recognize too, that\\n      the sick individual has to take an active part in his treatment and not be\\n      merely the passive recipient of this or that treatment. For just as it is\\n      rightly said that man does not live by alone, so should it be emphasized\\n      that man cannot be cured by medicine alone. He must see to it himself that\\n      he lives as far as possible a physically and psychically healthy life.\\n      Indeed, each individual has a power within himself to help in his own\\n      cure.\\n      \\n Do the official schools of medicine\\n      teach such an art today? I am afraid not: they are so intent on seeking\\n      the specific treatment for this or that named disease or the antibiotic\\n      that will most effectively put out of action the organism regarded as the\\n      cause of the disease, that they are losing sight of the individual\\n      himself.\\n      \\n But Homoeopathy in its persistent\\n      search for the reactions of the individual to his environment in the\\n      broadest sense, no matter of what the patient is complaining surely\\n      fulfills these requirements, especially when it is recognized that the\\n      homoeopathic potencies do not anything to the patient as do the drugs of\\n      the dominant school, but rather stimulate the patients own recuperative\\n      powers to overcome the infection or re - establish the normal metabolism\\n      which has become deranged by the illness.\\n      \\n When you consider how the homoeopathic\\n      physician diagnoses the individuality of his patient over and above the\\n      name of the disease from which he is suffering, and uses for the purpose\\n      of his prescription rather than the name of the disease this personal\\n      diagnosis of the patients mental and emotional reactions, his responses to\\n      changes in weather conditions, the alternations in his environment which\\n      influence his symptoms, etc., one realize how very individualistic is the\\n      Homoeopathic prescription fitted to that particular patient.\\n      \\n The homoeopathic physician does not\\n      seek for a remedy specific to any named disease and which he can thus\\n      apply almost automatically once he has made his organic diagnosis, which\\n      in quite an appreciable number of instances may ultimately be found to be\\n      wrong and so the treatment based upon it must therefore have been wrong.\\n      He does not, as is so often done, merely suppress the most outstanding\\n      symptom by an appropriate drug; for example giving an anodyne to mask the\\n      pain or removing the skin eruption by some strong local application, in\\n      other words putting the dust under the mat and pretending the room is\\n      clean.\\n      \\n Strangely enough the homoeopathic\\n      physician is often accused by his allopathic critic in his ignorance of\\n      Homoeopathy, of merely treating symptoms, whereas it is the critic himself\\n      who practices this superficial medicine. The homoeopathic physician, on\\n      the other hand, treats his patient as a whole through his symptoms and\\n      their modifications through changes in the environment, which is quite a\\n      different matter.\\n      \\n Homoeopathic therapy, unlike methods of\\n      treatment, is based on a natural law \"Similia Similibus\\n      Curentur\" \"Likes may be cured by likes\" which has been\\n      proved time and time again by experiment and which anyone with the will to\\n      do may prove for himself. It is not subject to constant change brought\\n      about by this or that latest discovery, and which itself will soon have to\\n      give way to the still later idea.\\n      \\n Having now introduced to you our actor,\\n      what of the scene in which he is to play his role?\\n      \\n This is the nineteen hundred and fifty\\n      - fourth year of the Christian era and the second year of the reign of our\\n      much loved and admired young Queen Elizabeth II, who will remember while\\n      in south Africa on her twenty - first birthday, before she had any idea\\n      that she would so soon be called to such an exalted position as she holds\\n      today, broadcast to the commonwealth and Empire her resolve to dedicate\\n      her life to the service of this grand community which dedication she\\n      recently repeated at her Coronation.\\n      \\n Here in Great Britain we have a more or\\n      less complete welfare state, with which idea some of us may very strongly\\n      disagree, whilst others believe such a development is the result of a\\n      natural very desirable social evolution.\\n      \\n As one necessary ingredient of this\\n      welfare state came, in 1948, the initiation of the National Health\\n      Service, through which the great majority of the population receives its\\n      medical attention, although it is rightly available to all.\\n      \\n When we come to consider the role that\\n      homoeo - therapeutics should play in this scheme, I would suggest that we\\n      should regard the problem from the purely medical aspect, forgetting any\\n      political party allegiances or sympathies we may have; or if we cannot\\n      forget them we should remember that the organization of the National\\n      Insurance Scheme of which the National Health Service is but a part, was\\n      first blue printed by the well - known Liberal supporter, Lord Beveridge,\\n      and the Health Service plans developed by the Coalition Government of all\\n      three major political parties.\\n      \\n We are living at present in an age\\n      which may very justifiably be regarded as a violent age in which have been\\n      developed so many appalling instruments of destruction, the use of some of\\n      which we are quite complacently accepting and from the use of others we\\n      are refraining, not because we consider them immoral, but simply through\\n      the fear of the wholesale destruction which would be caused by their use.\\n      We are seeing X-rays used in very high voltages in the treatment of\\n      cancer, we are being constantly remained of the use of dangerous drugs in\\n      medicine, without justification, in my opinion, bearing in mind the\\n      doubtful and evanescent ameliorations they produce and the violent\\n      surgical treatment of mental patients.\\n      \\n One further violence we should not\\n      forget is the way some of our foods are devitalized by the extraction of\\n      this or that portion of the natural product for purposes quite foreign to\\n      the well - being of the people who are to feed on them; or they are\\n      contaminated by the addition of this or that dangerous chemical, either\\n      during the growing of the plant, in the form of sprays, or as so called\\n      improvers in, for instance, the manufacture of white bread. It is very\\n      significant in this regard that quite a lot of attention is paid to the\\n      protection of the man who sprays the crops, but the right of the consumer\\n      to have uncontaminated food is slurred over by the unjustifiable statement\\n      that the amount of these chemicals so consumed is so small that it cannot\\n      have any bad effect on the consumer. We who practice Homoeopathy know how\\n      unwarranted is such a statement.\\n      \\n Can we homoeopathic physicians and\\n      patient hope to be able to do anything to make the still small voice of\\n      Homoeopathy heard in all this tumult, so that we may return to a saner and\\n      more healthful way of life and help our young Queen in her lifes work for\\n      the communitys sake?\\n      \\n Can we expect any help from the leaders\\n      of the medical profession? I am afraid not, because although I believe it\\n      accurate to state that there is a very slowly growing interest in, and\\n      tolerance of our work by individual doctors, the medical authorities are\\n      still, in their prejudice, strongly opposed to us. The London University\\n      still refuses to recognize our Hospital as a post - graduate teaching\\n      Hospital: the British Medical Association prohibits the formation of a\\n      homoeopathic section of its organization, and the Royal College of\\n      Physicians still refuses its membership to any one known as a homoeopathic\\n      physician. Yet in spite of this unfavourable environment, I firmly believe\\n      that there is a future for our method of therapeutics: but it will have to\\n      be pursued with courage, determination, foresight and energy. Surely if we\\n      believe as I do, that we are the guardians of a system of treatment\\n      destined to make our people healthier and therefore more efficient and\\n      happier, we would be failing in our duty to our country if we did not take\\n      every means in our power to acquaint the community at large with the\\n      advantages of this system and the dangers of ignoring it. This is a duty,\\n      not only of the profession, but also of the laity interested in\\n      Homoeopathy and who have experienced its benefits.\\n      \\n Every physician has two professional\\n      obligation to the community, that of preserving its health and that of\\n      endeavouring to restore it to being when it has fallen by the way.\\n      \\n The homoeopathic physician, thorough\\n      his knowledge acquired through the provings of drugs, even in\\n      infinitesimal doses, has, I believe, a very special responsibility as\\n      regards the prophylaxis of disease. It seems to me that a great deal of\\n      chronic ill health may quite conceivably be due to the manipulations of\\n      our foods and to the artificial manuring of the ground in which many of\\n      them are grown. Experiments have been carried our proving that plants\\n      grown in soil enriched by natural manuring, are much less prone to\\n      diseases than those grown with the help of artificial chemical manures. It\\n      seems a fairly justified conclusion that vegetables grown under these\\n      artificial conditions may quite well be deficient in something necessary\\n      for our perfect health. It is therefore incumbent upon the physician to\\n      advocate whenever possible the ingestion of healthily grown foods in the\\n      widest sense of that term.\\n      \\n The same duty applies when we consider\\n      the great amount of drugging in which the community at large indulges by\\n      its excessive smoking, particularly when aggravated by the practice of\\n      inhaling, and by the continued and prolonged use of drugs for this or that\\n      symptom, too often, unfortunately, though not always, on the prescription\\n      of their medical advisors.\\n      \\n There is a great lack throughout the\\n      community of any real enthusiasm for perfect health: we are only too prone\\n      to be content to follow like sheep, the unintelligent and harmful\\n      practices of the majority of our fellows.\\n      \\n Similarly in the curative realm, we\\n      homoeopathic physicians have special obligations.\\n      \\n When considering our position vis-a-vis\\n      the rest of the profession, we must never lose sight of the fact that our\\n      approach to the sick individual is a much broader and more comprehensive\\n      one than that of the dominant school. This latter prides itself on its\\n      scientific approach to its problems. One must, however, always be on ones\\n      guard against being hypnotized by that word scientific. The scientific\\n      aspect of any phenomenon or problem dealing with humanity is only one\\n      limited aspect of that problem. To get a complete picture one must\\n      consider other aspect, such as the aesthetic, emotional, maybe religious,\\n      and above all, perhaps one might say embracing all, the philosophical\\n      approach. This complex approach to his patients problem is the one that\\n      the homoeopathic physician always strives to adopt, and so never loses\\n      sight of the ego of the patient, while at the same time not forgetting his\\n      physical make - up.\\n      \\n Because this approach of ours to our\\n      patients is a much broader and more comprehensive one than the much\\n      vaunted scientific aspect, which the dominant school has come to regard as\\n      the Ultima Thule of medicine, I deplore the oft - repeated request of some\\n      of my colleagues that we should forsake our philosophy and make our work\\n      as scientific as theirs. I do not mean to imply by this that we should\\n      neglect the scientific angle of our patients illness but we should always\\n      remember that is only one facet of our problem. That is why we take such\\n      pains to diagnose our patients personality with his reaction to his\\n      environment in addition to the physical diagnosis of the case in order to\\n      arrive at our prescription for his malady. In other words, we should\\n      endeavour to lead our dominant school colleagues to our way of thinking,\\n      rather than that we should adopt theirs.\\n      \\n At the same time must always remember\\n      that if our philosophy should seem at any time to contradict so - called\\n      scientific laws, we must re - examine our philosophy, and if necessary\\n      modify it, while at the same time remembering that many times in the past\\n      what have been regarded as laws have ultimately been proved not to be so.\\n      Thus it is evident that we must never relax our self - examination.\\n      \\n What shall be the role of the\\n      homoeopathic laity?\\n      \\n The first thing for them to remember is\\n      that we are living in a democratic country whose government is dependent\\n      on the goodwill of the governed, and that, if a sufficient number of\\n      voters desire a certain line of action, that line will be adopted by the\\n      government.\\n      \\n The second thought is that there are\\n      not nearly sufficient doctors practising Homoeopathy in Great Britain to\\n      satisfy the present demand, let alone any further increased demand in the\\n      future, for this line of treatment.\\n      \\n Does not this seem strange, having\\n      regard to the great advantage to humanity that Homoeopathy provides? Not\\n      if one looks below the surface and so finds the reason for this shortage.\\n      \\n Surely the most potent reason is that\\n      Homoeopathy is not taught in the official Medical Schools, either as a pre\\n      - or post - graduate study. The London University when asked to recognize\\n      the Royal London Homoeopathic Hospital as a post - graduate Medical\\n      School, refused on the plea that as Homoeopathy was not taught in the\\n      undergraduate Medical Schools, it could not find a place for it in its\\n      post - graduate curriculum.\\n      \\n It is, of course, nonsense to suggest\\n      that a graduate should pursue his studies only in those subject of which\\n      he had already obtained some knowledge in his undergraduate days and\\n      should not wish to obtain information on any new or extra subject.\\n      \\n The University Medical Shools are\\n      enabled to a great extent through Government grants. We must therefore\\n      find some way of influencing whatever Government be in power to bring\\n      pressure to bear upon the London University to remove this obstacle to the\\n      better health of the community at large. I am quite satisfied that once\\n      this academic recognition is obtained we shave many more post - graduate\\n      students of Homoeopathy.\\n      \\n I believe than in a democratic\\n      community, having a universal State Medical Service, it is the bounden\\n      duty of the Government to remove all obstacles to the peoples obtaining\\n      that form of medical treatment in which they have confidence. So long as\\n      Homoeopathy is denied its legitimate status, so long must be Government be\\n      deemed to b failing in its duty to the country.\\n      \\n If, however, we are to achieve this\\n      desirable object of full recognition, we must all, professional and laity,\\n      be fired with enthusiasm, not only for the abstract cause of Homoeopathy,\\n      but for being partners with our young Queen in delicating our lives to the\\n      community.\\n      \\n When we do this we shall help to make\\n      this second Elizabethan era one to be remembered throughout the ages to\\n      come as surpassing the first Elizabethan era in that it gained not so much\\n      the economic and political leadership of the world - though that is not to\\n      be despised - but showed the way to the most healthful and spiritual way\\n      of life that all the world look notice and followed suit.\\n      \\n To sum up, the Role of Homoeopathy, as\\n      I see it, is to humanize the practice of medicine. By that I mean it must\\n      bring the practice of medicine into line with a reasoned philosophy of\\n      life, restore to it its artistry and rid it of all unnecessary hazards. It\\n      is to do this, not from any abstract academic sense of superiority, but in\\n      order the years to come are not those of merely another reign, but to\\n      ensure a veritable Renaissance, starting with the second Elizabethan era\\n      in which Great Britain will take its rightful place in the comity of\\n      nations as the pathfinder to a way of life for which posterity will be\\n      able to say \"Thank God for Queen Elizabeth the Second and her\\n      peoples.', u'Tresorie - Vibrations and Teachings of Hahnemann [Vibrations and\\nTeachings of Hahnemann]\\n\\n OF SAMUEL HAHNEMANN\\n      \\n [Read by title before the Bureau of of\\n      Public Health, A.I.H.\\n      \\n Convention, Atlantic City, June 1951].\\n      \\n C.P.

Knight of Petaluma, California, who for thirty\\n      years conducted research for the United STates Steel Corporation and Mr.\\n      H.H. Holmes, for years conductor of research for the Bell Telephone\\n      Laboratories. This paper embodies part of the reports of the annual\\n      meeting of this eminent group of men.\\n      \\n First, let us recognize the fact that\\n      the universe is composed of atoms. Thus, all living matter, whether animal\\n      or vegetable, must also be composed of atoms. This means, of course, that\\n      the human body is an aggregate of billions of atoms, all responding to the\\n      laws of physics and chemistry. Iron, phosphorus, sodium potassium, copper\\n      and all the other mineral aggregates respond to the same laws inside the\\n      human body as outside the human body. Einstein has made the statement the\\n      matter and energy are one and the same. Energy can be converted into\\n      matter and matter into energy. Among the most remarkable of statements is\\n      that musical chords can be converted into chemical compounds, and chemical\\n      compounds again returned to musical notes. The greater the divisibility of\\n      matter, the greater its energy output.\\n      \\n Some years ago the Bell Telephone\\n      Laboratories of New York City, endeavoring to find some way to send a\\n      hundred voice over the same wire at the same time, discovered that human\\n      bodies radiate or vibrate. It is well to keep in mind that radiation,\\n      frequency and vibration are one and the same. The outstanding scientist\\n      for the Bell Telephone LAboratories who made this discovery decided that\\n      it might be possible to measure the wave length of the human body as well\\n      as its rate of vibration. He finally succeeded in discovering that the\\n      human bodys rate of vibration is eighty million cycles per second which is\\n      equivalent to a 3.66 mater wave length. As you all know, the rate of\\n      vibration or frequency of electrical energy that produces the ordinary\\n      lights which light up our houses is a sixty cycle current, or sixty\\n      vibrations per second; thus the rate of frequency or vibration of the\\n      human body is far beyond the range of the human eye. The great importance\\n      of this discovery was not realized until such men as Mr. S.S. Knight and\\n      others in the field of human research decided that this discovery would be\\n      of inestimable value in the treatment of the sick and that, if the human\\n      bodys rate of vibration is 3.66 meters, anything different from 3.66 must\\n      be disease. With this information at hand, the noted researchers proceeded\\n      to build a machine which would duplicate the energy of the human body. A\\n      machine was finally built which embodies a damp wave. A damp wave is only\\n      a spark or an arc.\\n      \\n At one of the meeting I attended, a\\n      discussion arose as to the types of vibrations produced by the machines on\\n      which Mr. Knight was working. When the question came up as to what Mr.\\n      Knight thought the energy might be, he responded that from his\\n      understanding of energy from vegetable and animal matter he considered\\n      that the energy produced by the arc - actuated machine was the same as\\n      that produced by potentization of remedies for homoeopathic use. My\\n      surprise was so great at this remark that I still have hardly recovered\\n      from my elation. In discussing this matter with Mr. L.N. Hampton of the\\n      Bell Telephone Laboratories of New York City, I asked how many different\\n      vibrations there would be in the human range, and his reply was \"Oh,\\n      just billions, and billions and billions, and more billions after\\n      that.\" Further discussion of this matter with Mr. S.S. Knight brought\\n      out the explanation of the action of the homoeopathic potency in the\\n      treatment of the sick on the basis of physics.\\n      \\n First, when any mass or disease is\\n      acted upon by any frequency or vibration, it tends to degrade or shorten\\n      the frequency of that mass of disease. This means the cure of disease, and\\n      is true whether it is a growth, an infection, or any other type of\\n      disease. A statement made by Mr. H.H. Holmes of the Bell Telephone\\n      Laboratories seemed an explanation of the action of a homoeopathic remedy.\\n      He stated that when vibrations are identical and meet each other in\\n      opposite directions they are neutralized. In other words the vibration of\\n      a disease is met 180 degrees out of phase by the like vibration of the\\n      remedy which, of course, is a demonstration of similia.\\n      \\n There are machines now in existence\\n      which will duplicate the same energy as that produced by trituration and\\n      potentization. One of these machines, as the present time, is in the\\n      research laboratory of the Belmont Group of researchers, as well as at\\n      Yale University.\\n      \\n Dr. Linus Pauling, president of the\\n      American Chemical Society and Chairman of the California Institute of\\n      Technology, states \"Within every atom and every molecule there flows\\n      electric currents and every substance is a system of electro-magnetic\\n      fields\". And yet, quoting Dr. Harold S. Burr of Yale University,\\n      \"every living things is a storage battery charged with energy we call\\n      electricity. All of the seeds, plants and animals we have tested show a\\n      direct relationship between electric potentials and vigor.\"\\n      \\n With delicate instruments capable of\\n      measuring power currents of one - millionth of one volt and less, Dr. Burr\\n      and his assistants have traced and measured power - patterns through the\\n      plant and animal world. They found characteristic individual patterns in\\n      each type of life.\\n      \\n Here let me explain that each\\n      individual, being somewhat different from every other, would make it\\n      necessary to find different remedies to meet different humans, because\\n      each individual has its own and specific and characteristic vibration or\\n      frequency which must be identical to that of the remedy which is\\n      prescribed.\\n      \\n In human beings, Dr. Burr has proved\\n      the \"right side of the body is almost uniformly positive to the left\\n      side by several millivolts, although this bears no discernible relation to\\n      handedness.\"\\n      \\n Again here we have a demonstration of\\n      Hahnemanns statement that some remedies act right - sidedly, such as\\n      Lycopodium and others, such as Lachesis, affect the left side of the body.\\n      Also here we have proos of the electrical current of the body. A remedy,\\n      to be right - sided has to provide an opposite polarity. Lachesis must be\\n      the opposite polarity of the body or it could not affect it.\\n      \\n Further, Dr. Burr has made the\\n      statement that the right index finger of a woman increases its\\n      \"positive polarity\" by several thousand microvolts on the day of\\n      ovulation, then drops to monthly low during the menstrual period 14 to 17\\n      days later. Since similar records from pregnant females show \"entire\\n      absence of such cyclic phenomena\", it is probably safe to assume that\\n      simple electric measurements may someday replace all present methods of\\n      birth control and fertility determination.\\n      \\n Dr. Burt has also stated that sudden\\n      increases or break - downs of electrical circuits in all forms of life an\\n      indication of abnormal and highly dangerous conditions, as borne out by\\n      experiments with cancerous tissue.\\n      \\n Drs. Walter R. Miles and Lloyd H. Beck\\n      of Yale Universitys psychology department have demonstrated an experiment\\n      that leads them to believe that the \"sense of smell\" is another\\n      electric power form, actually a broadcast by the nose of infra - red rays\\n      in the 7.5 to 14 micron bands.\\n      \\n Dr. Harold Lampert of the Medical\\n      School of Yale University, H.F. Newman and Ralph Eichorn of Beth Israel\\n      Hospital, New York City, began to bombard the gall bladders of sick\\n      rabbits and dogs with high frequency sound tones of a specific wave\\n      length. All of the animals had severe gallstone conditions. Treatments\\n      with the sound wave, lasting from five to sixty seconds, crumbled the\\n      pebbly gall - stones and enabled them to pass painlessly from the body.\\n      Examinations revealed no damage to the surrounding living tissue. These\\n      tremendously important experiments are being extended to human beings.\\n      \\n I might go on indefinitely citing\\n      eminent authorities who discuss physics in relation to human energy in the\\n      cure of the sick. There is but one law of cure and that is the law of cure\\n      and that is the law of similia. This is being proven daily by physics and\\n      physiology departments of the great universities, seventeen of which I\\n      have visited and discussed physics in its relationship to disease.\\n      Homoeopathy is destined to be revived by the physics and physiology\\n      departments of the great universities, much to the humiliation of our\\n      national and international associations, unless we take prompt action to\\n      see that this relation of physics to the cure of disease is a pure\\n      application of Hahnemanns teachings. Instruments are now in existence\\n      which can be used to measure the energy of potentized remedies. Not only\\n      Arndt of columbia, and Schulz, the great German scientist, have declared\\n      that crude drugs destroy life processes, but not the Baruch committee,\\n      headed by Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur, has declared, after years of investigation\\n      by 400 of the most outstanding scientists of the United States, that drugs\\n      are to become obsolete. With this mind, let us act promptly.\\n      \\n Homoeopathy has been on the decline in\\n      America for some years, and now it is being rapidly adopted in Europe. In\\n      France, homoeopathic remedies have been admitted to the official Codex. In\\n      Switzerland, increasing interest is being maintained in the same sphere.\\n      News comes of great activity in homoeopathy in India and Pakistan, and in\\n      South American countries. In Britain, homoeopathic hospitals are now in\\n      full co - operation with the general scheme of the National Health\\n      Services.\\n      \\n Perhaps the most important advance of\\n      all, in Britain was achieved when the royal assent was given to that act\\n      of Parliament which sealed the incorporation of the Faculty of\\n      Homoeopathy, Homoeopathic hospitals will therefore be able to maintain\\n      their independent specialities without the danger of becoming engulfed in\\n      the ramification of administrative control, and education in homoeopathy\\n      will be able to continue with all the more certainty with the hospitals to\\n      help.\\n      \\n French homoeopaths are in close contact\\n      with the Curie Institute for Radiology regarding the effect of their\\n      remedies. As a matter of fact, the father of Pierre Curie, discoverer of\\n      radium, was a homoeopathic physician.\\n      \\n At the University of Washington, Mr.\\n      H.H. Holmes, long in the research laboratories, gave much of his time to\\n      interest the physics and physiology departments of the medical school of\\n      this University to see the relation between physics, as it is applied in\\n      the arc - actuated oscillator which duplicates homoeopathic energies, and\\n      homoeopathy, according to Mr. Knight. It was with the greatest humiliation\\n      that I was unable to interest out national and international associations\\n      sufficiently to support the Northwest association in its endeavor to place\\n      a homoeopathic department in the University of Washington.\\n      \\n Mr. Royal Dr. Rood, brother of our\\n      esteemed Dr. Marian Belle Rood, has stated that the American drug\\n      industries believe that they have finally won a seventy - five year war to\\n      destroy the practice of homoeopathic medicine; but the battle has only\\n      begun. Strategy is needed. Urge the American Institute of Homoeopathy at\\n      this meeting to appoint a committee, headed by Roger Schmidt, actively to\\n      pursue a program which will acquaint the physics and physiology\\n      departments of the various universities with physics as it is applied in\\n      the cure of the sick.\\n      \\n It is now known that the human brain\\n      contains approximately 10 billion neurons. Each neuron, science now\\n      believes, contains an electrical charge which it uses to accept an idea, a\\n      sight, a smell, or to create the various forms of physical response. Dr.\\n      Otto Lesser, M.D., PH.D. Berlin, in his excellent work entitled\\n      \"Critique of Homoeopathy\", is in excellent agreement with the\\n      facts of physics. In potentizing substances into a state of higher\\n      remedial activity, we do not need the introduction of any hypothetic\\n      force. We have sufficient support from the knowledge of physics on action\\n      and energy. Radiation can be produced by mechanical procedures such as\\n      trituration, which he designates as tribo - luminescence, and these\\n      radiation effects can be observed, and can be transmitted by the\\n      receipient.\\n      \\n To demonstrate further the power of\\n      high potencies, it is known from elementary physics that increased\\n      surface, greater distance formed by an indifferent medium, dialectric and\\n      electro - lite, and greater regularity in the arrangement, all tend to\\n      elevate the level of the potential energy.\\n      \\n Dr. Morton Whitby, in his epoch making\\n      book entitled, \"Theory of Life, Disease and Death\", has stated\\n      in his introduction:\\n      \\n My researches over the past six years\\n      have convinced me that life exists only because of the electrical energy\\n      which is within the living substances, whether it is a seed, a blade of\\n      grass, a leaf from any plant, including the human body. The electrical\\n      energy of living matter is the sum total of the collective tissue\\n      energy.\"\\n      \\n Here again I wish to state disease must\\n      be treated by the totality of the symptoms, and there is no such thing as\\n      a local disease. Dr. Whitby further states:\\n      \\n \"The difference between inorganic\\n      and organic matter is that in the former, electrical energy is static,\\n      whereas, in the latter, it is dynamic and fluctuates with its altered\\n      chemical and physical states\"\\n      \\n From the foregoing it is evident that\\n      Hahnemanns concept of dynamis is a demonstration of our present under -\\n      standing of the electric energy present in potentized remedies, and his\\n      application, one hundred and fifty years ago, interpreted in present day\\n      physics, means that the electric energy of the remedy meets the disease\\n      180 degrees out of phase. Thus, similia is proven.', u'Tresorie - PRACTICAL SUGGESTION IN HOMOEOPATHIC THERAPEUTICS [Practical\\nSuggestion in Homoeopathic Therapeutics] The Homoeopathic Herald By Das N C\\n\\n The knowledge, that we get, about a\\n      particular drug, from books of materia medica is incomplete and we must\\n      always supplement our basic knowledge, by going through the different Case\\n      - reports published in different magazines and journals, and should\\n      ourselves publish our own successes and failures with different drugs,\\n      thereby interchanging our own experiences.\\n      \\n The following are some interesting\\n      cases, collected from the records of our clinic, the first two of which\\n      illustrate the use of Sulphur in uterine haemorrhage.\\n      \\n CASE I.\\n      \\n A lady aged about 42, came with the\\n      following complaints:\\n      \\n 1.

Skin troubles further yielded\\n      but haemorrhage was continuing in an aggravated form. No medicine. We\\n      waited for 213 days more and then gave several haemorrhagic remedies with\\n      no result. At last Sulphur 6-2 doses were given on 10.10.54 one dose to be\\n      taken every 3rd day.\\n      \\n 15.10.54. Bleeding practically stopped.\\n      It began to be less immediately after taking the first dose, and it\\n      completely stopped after the 3rd dose of Sulphur with amelioration of all\\n      other symptoms. The sixth potency had to be followed by the 30th\\n      subsequently.\\n      \\n Now what we get from books of materia\\n      medica as that (Clarke and Farrington) about the action of Sulphur on\\n      female genital organs is that at mainly produces symptoms arising from\\n      congestion of the organs. Scanty, delayed or suppressed menses are the\\n      symptoms that we get usually find under this drug. Sulphur as a\\n      haemorrhagic remedy is not frequently come across. We get mentions of this\\n      remedy, however, in metrorrhagia in Allens sky note. According to Lippe\\n      \"Metrorrhagia that has not been well since her last miscarriage\"\\n      will be cured by a single dose at new moon.\\n      \\n Before illustrating this statement of\\n      Dr. Lippe from one of our own case records, a little discussion about the\\n      triumph of Sulphur over the well renowned haemorrhagic remedies in\\n      controlling the haemorrhage in the above mentioned case, I think, will not\\n      be out of place.\\n      \\n In the selection of the Similimum at\\n      the time when new additional acute symptoms have been superadded in a\\n      chronic case, the basic symptoms of the patient must also be taken into\\n      consideration, otherwise we would miss the proper remedy. In such cases\\n      the modalities and characteristics of the newly developed acute symptoms\\n      are always modified by the constitution of the patient and the so modified\\n      symptom complex should have now to considered for the Similimum and in\\n      most cases the Similimum will be found in the constitutional remedy of the\\n      patient if the latter be very prominent and peculiar.\\n      \\n In this case, we get strong symptoms\\n      both for graphites and Sulphur, both of which are constitutional to the\\n      patient. In such cases according to Organon the more apt. remedy should be\\n      given first and its action should be allowed to be completed and then the\\n      whole case should again be studied and if the symptoms of our second\\n      choice still persist it should be then given and in chronic cases it is\\n      often necessary to employ several antipsoric remedies in succession (Vide\\n      arts. No. 169-171 6th Am. edition).\\n      \\n In the above case, for graphites, we\\n      have the following symptoms:\\n      \\n 1. Skin troubles.\\n      \\n 2. Constipation.\\n      \\n 3. Built of the patient.\\n      \\n 4. Dandruff with falling of hairs.\\n      \\n 5. Cracking of soles in winter.\\n      \\n 6. Pyorrhoea etc.\\n      \\n For Sulphur the symptoms are\\n      \\n 1. Skin troubles.\\n      \\n 2. Burning of palms and soles.\\n      \\n 3. Constipation.\\n      \\n 4. Aversion for bathing and also\\n      aggravation from bathing.\\n      \\n Numerically graphites covers more\\n      symptoms but the physical generals which are given more importance than\\n      the physical symptoms are in favour of Sulphur. So very likely Sulphur\\n      should have been given more preference and it should have been the first\\n      prescription.', u'Tresorie - BRIGHT\\'S DISEASE [Brights Disease]\\n\\n BRIGHT demonstrated the existence of a\\n      morbid species characterized by inflammation of the kidney, albuminuria\\n      and oedema. He deemed the different clinical forms which this disease\\n      presents different phases of the same morbid condition. Physicians, after\\n      him, struck by the difference which these forms assume, subdivided\\n      Bright\\'s disease into two distinct diseases: parenchymatous nephritis and\\n      interstitial nephritis. There is, then, a dualist school opposed to the\\n      unicist school of Bright. It is represented principally by Lancereau. Is\\n      there really a single malady, of different characteristics, according to\\n      the phases which it goes through, or do there really exist several\\n      affections of different nature, incorrectly joined together by the single\\n      name of \"Bright\\'s disease?\".\\n      \\n This question is difficult to answer.\\n      On the one hand is a fact impossible to contest, namely, that when\\n      parenchymatous nephritis ends neither by recovery nor by death, either in\\n      the first weeks or the first months of the disease, but pursues a slow and\\n      chronic course, it is soon accompanied by the symptoms and the lesions of\\n      interstitial nephritis, so that as a consequence in such a case, the\\n      interstitial nephritis, with ultimate renal atrophy, is indeed, the last\\n      phase of the parenchymatous nephritis; and that in such a case the theory\\n      of Bright is absolutely true.\\n      \\n On the other hand, it cannot be denied\\n      that there are cases in which the disease begins in an insidious manner,\\n      progresses very slowly, with more or less complete periods of remission,\\n      and with periods of aggravation characterized by a symptomatic complexus\\n      which has no resemblance to that of parenchymatous nephritis, and in which\\n      the kidney, throughout all periods of the disease, shows the lesions of\\n      interstitial nephritis, and ends fatally in renal atrophy.\\n      \\n In such cases the nephritis is\\n      interstitial in the outset, and rightly distinguished from Bright\\'s\\n      disease proper. To this must be added that interstitial nephritis is\\n      always joined of gout, of syphilis and of lead-poisoning; that it is\\n      accompanied, in consequence, by the hepatic, pulmonary, encephalic, and,\\n      especially, cardiac lesions common to arterio-sclerosis.\\n      \\n Physicians who, like Lecorche and\\n      Talamon, defend the unicist doctrine of Bright\\'s disease, strive to show\\n      that in acute cases, designated by the name of parenchymatous nephritis,\\n      there is always an affection of the heart and of the vessels analogous to\\n      that which is always observed in interstitial nephritis. They affirm that\\n      every nephritis is always accompanied by considerable increase in arterial\\n      pressure, and consequently by dilatation and then by hypertrophy of the\\n      heart.\\n      \\n Traube has explained these cardiac and\\n      vascular phenomena by the obstacle which the arterial circulation meets in\\n      the kidney in consequence of inflammation there. This explanation is\\n      questionable, but, what is more important, dilatation of the heart is by\\n      no means always found in all cases of Bright\\'s disease. (Lecorche, page\\n      419.).\\n      \\n Thus, Bamberger\\'s statistics show 807\\n      cases of primary Bright\\'s disease to be accompanied only 344 times by\\n      hypertrophy of the heart.\\n      \\n The statistics of Galabin cover 101\\n      cases and show only 34 cases of hypertrophy. Upon autopsies made at the\\n      Charity Hospital and Berlin, Vais remarked that in 20 cases of\\n      parenchymatous nephritis, hypertrophy existed in 14 cases.\\n      \\n Labadie-Lagrave, in the Dictionary of\\n      medicine and Surgery, says, word for word, \"that, if a certain degree\\n      of dilatation of the ventricles, together with fatty degeneration of the\\n      myocardium, is the rule in chronic parenchymatous nephritis, hypertrophy\\n      of the left ventricle is wholly foreign to the symptomatology of this\\n      nephritis.\" (Article on \"The Kidney,\" page 783.).\\n      \\n Experiments made upon animals are not\\n      sufficiently unanimous in results to show that hindrance to the\\n      circulation determines cardiac hypertrophy and elevation of arterial\\n      pressure.\\n      \\n Ludwig tied the renal arteries without\\n      causing either elevation of arterial pressure or hypertrophy of the heart.\\n      Grawitz and Israel, contracting the renal and removing one of the kidneys,\\n      produced hypertrophy of the left ventricle, but did not increase arterial\\n      pressure.\\n      \\n Lewinski alone produced hypertrophy of\\n      the left heart and an increase in the arterial tension by contracting the\\n      renal arteries in dogs. (Leorche, page 407.).\\n      \\n The conclusion from the total of these\\n      experiments, and also from clinical facts, is that hypertrophy of the left\\n      ventricle, instead of being closely united tote existence of the\\n      parenchymatous nephritis, is only an exceptional occurrence in the course\\n      of this disease. Lecorche and Talamon, and those who uphold the doctrine\\n      of absolute unity, plainly exaggerate when they speak of hypertrophy of\\n      the heart as a constant lesion in this disease. Increase of arterial\\n      tension, which, according to Huchard, has always for its corollary chronic\\n      inflammation of the arteries and hypertrophy of the heart, is the constant\\n      lesion of interstitial nephritis, for the reason that this latter form of\\n      disease is joined to the existence of gout, or of lead-poisoning, which\\n      has for its lesion general arterio-sclerosis.\\n      \\n It is difficult to say whether\\n      interstitial nephritis, supervening as terminal phase of parenchymatous\\n      nephritis, is accompanied by general arterio-sclerosis or not. It is\\n      difficult to say, because we have not yet studied this question of\\n      pathological anatomy, nor distinguished sufficiently simple interstitial\\n      nephritis from the interstitial nephritis which follows parenchymatous\\n      nephritis, and which constitutes Bright\\'s disease in its last stage.\\n      \\n Upon the whole, then, we hold that\\n      there is such a thing as an interstitial nephritis which, from beginning\\n      to end, has always the characteristics of sclerosis; that this nephritis\\n      is accompanied always by intense thirst, by polyuria, by albumin in the\\n      urine, usually in small quantity and sometimes but intermittently present,\\n      by pale urine of low specific gravity, with notable diminution of urea.\\n      Let us add, as a characteristic of this form of nephritis, that it is not\\n      usually accompanied by oedema, except in the period of cachexia.\\n      \\n Interstitial nephritis is, in symptoms\\n      and in lesions, absolutely distinct from parenchymatous nephritis. It is\\n      also distinguished by an extremely chronic course, a very long duration,\\n      and a constant termination by uraemic accidents.\\n      \\n Interstitial nephritis is, plainly\\n      distinguished from parenchymatous disease by its relations with gout,\\n      plumbism, and the general arterio-sclerosis accompanying these two latter\\n      conditions.\\n      \\n We shall, therefore, take chapters for\\n      the consideration of our subject: one for Bright\\'s disease, a morbid\\n      species; the other for interstitial nephritis, a disorder depending on\\n      arterio-sclerosis.\\n      \\n CHAPTER FIRST.-bRIGHT\\'S DISEASE.\\n      \\n Bright\\'s disease is characterized by\\n      anasarca, albuminuria, and inflammation of the kidney, first\\n      parenchymatous, but finally interstitial, if the disease lasts long\\n      enough.\\n      \\n Bright\\'s disease has two forms-one\\n      markedly acute in its beginning, the order of insidious origin and chronic\\n      course.\\n      \\n 1. Acute Bright\\'s Disease.-This may\\n      begin when the patient is in full health, or, on the contrary, by way of\\n      complication, in the course or at the end of acute diseases: scarlet\\n      fever, diphtheria, typhoid fever, pneumonia, etc.\\n      \\n An intense febrile movement, vomiting\\n      and headache mark the beginning of the disease. The patient usually feels\\n      a dull pain in the region of the kidneys, while at the same time the urine\\n      is diminished to quantity, although micturition is frequent; the urine\\n      often contains blood, is always high-colored, of specific gravity lower\\n      than normal-falling to 1010 or even 1006, together with, at the same time,\\n      a great diminution of urea, which falls as low as 9 grammes to the litre;\\n      but the characteristic feature is the presence of albumin in quantity\\n      habitually considerable (4, 6, 8, 12, grammes or more): sometimes the\\n      urine, when heated, solidifies in the tube.\\n      \\n At the same time the dropsy shows\\n      itself. It begins almost always in the face, in the eyelids or in the\\n      subconjunctival tissue. There is then observed what full of tears, and\\n      there is shown the raising of the ocular conjunctiva by a layer of liquid.\\n      OEdema increases over the face, the natural lines disappear, and the\\n      face-immobile, pale and shining-appears like marble. Dropsy spreads over\\n      the rest of the body and anasarca becomes general. The disease, thus\\n      established, progress rapidly, and terminate in some days or some weeks by\\n      death or recovery.\\n      \\n Death takes place customarily either\\n      fro internal oedema (oedema of the lung, oedema of the glottis, pleuritic\\n      effusion, pericarditis, encephalic dropsy); often general anasarca,\\n      diarrhoea and progressive enfeeblement characterize the last days of the\\n      disease; at other times uraemic accidents, of which the most frequent are\\n      eclampsia and coma, come to put an end to the sufferings of the patient.\\n      \\n When the disease is to terminate by\\n      recovery, the first symptom is the increase of the urine, which rises\\n      rapidly to 1,2,3, and 4 litres. At the same time the febrile movement\\n      disappears and anasarca diminished in proportion to the increase of the\\n      urine.\\n      \\n The liquid undergoes considerable\\n      change in composition- diminution of albumin, increase in urea, with, at\\n      the same time, increase in specific gravity to 1018 and 1022, are what we\\n      principally observe.\\n      \\n When this acute of Bright\\'s disease\\n      terminates neither by death nor recovery, it passes into the chronic\\n      state. The febrile movement disappears and anasarca diminishes. The urine\\n      increases in quantity; the albumin is less abundant, but persists. At this\\n      time the disease presents the course and symptoms which we shall find\\n      again soon when describing Bright\\'s disease, chronic from the outset.\\n      \\n 2. Bright\\'s Disease, Chronic fro the\\n      Outset.-This form, like the preceding, may follow an eruptive fever,\\n      typhoid fever, diphtheria or pneumonia, but in this case the beginning,\\n      instead of being febrile and tumultuous, is wholly unperceived and\\n      unrecognized; only by asking patients about their past may we succeed in\\n      connecting this chronic form of Bright\\'s disease to the previous existence\\n      of one of the diseases in which parenchymatous inflammation of the kidney\\n      is observed. In other cases damp cold, long continued, is the only cause\\n      to which we may attribute the development of the disease. Lastly, there\\n      are cases in which it is impossible to find or to establish the aetiology\\n      of this form of Bright\\'s disease, chronic from the outset. Loss of\\n      strength, a particular kind of anaemia, with paleness of the face,\\n      puffiness of the lids, interpalpebral oedema, pale urine voided\\n      frequently, especially at night, but in volume below normal, anorexia, and\\n      pain in the head mark the beginning of this form.\\n      \\n If one examines the urine, one finds\\n      specific gravity diminished from 1006 to 1010; urea falls also sometimes\\n      to 9 grammes per litre, but the principal characteristic is the presence\\n      of albumen in notable quantity, reaching 4,6,8,10 grammes and more.\\n      \\n After several months the disease shows\\n      its character more and more. Oedema increases considerably, changing\\n      place, seizing often the face in the morning and the ankles in the\\n      evening. There is waxy pallor; loss of strength is marked, while\\n      difficulty of breathing is caused by the least movement.\\n      \\n The disease thus established may be\\n      prolonged for months, or even longer, but never more than three years.\\n      \\n The course is not regularly\\n      progressive; there are exacerbations followed by more or less complete\\n      remissions.\\n      \\n The exacerbations are caused usually by\\n      a chill, by overwork, by emotion, but especially by errors of diet. They\\n      are characterized by a decrease in the urine, which sometimes becomes\\n      bloody and contains always a greater quantity of albumin. Anasarca makes\\n      progress. There is sometimes vomiting, sometimes headache, and always a\\n      loss of strength, until the patient is obliged to keep to his bed. Then\\n      amelioration takes place; it is marked by an increase in the quantity of\\n      the urine, a diminution in albumin and anasarca, return of strength and\\n      appetite. This remission which is never as complete as in interstitial\\n      nephritis, nevertheless allows the patient to resume his occupation, in\\n      port, and under the influence of intelligent treatment may be prolonged\\n      for a greater or less period of time.\\n      \\n From exacerbation to remission, and\\n      from remission to exacerbation, the disease, sometimes slowly, sometimes\\n      more rapidly, comes tote period of cachexia. This period is characterized\\n      by considerable dropsy. Anasarca distends the lower limbs, the skin of\\n      which becomes the seat of erythema, of fissures and sometimes of\\n      gangrenous plaques. Effusions form in the peritoneum and in the pleura. A\\n      certain degree of pulmonary oedema is usually evident. The urine becomes\\n      more more and more scanty, albumin is always present, but may diminish in\\n      quantity nevertheless, without improvement in the condition of the\\n      patient.\\n      \\n Anorexia, vomiting, and diarrhoea,\\n      still help to diminish the strength of the patient.\\n      \\n Seated usually upon a chair, because\\n      stay in bed is no longer possible, a prey to dyspnoea, resulting from\\n      dropsy of the pleura and lungs, pale and swollen, with limbs cracked and\\n      dripping incessantly with the liquid which distends them, the patient\\n      would die of exhaustion if uraemic accidents did not more usually\\n      terminate the disease. Failure of sight and headache, are the usual\\n      symptoms of this ending, which takes place either from eclampsia or from\\n      apoplexy, or from asphyxia, caused by pulmonary oedema.\\n      \\n In other cases, Bright\\'s disease\\n      assumes a form more chronic and slower. The renal lesion, from\\n      parenchymatous becomes interstitial, and the disease shows is every way\\n      the symptoms, course, and duration of the sclerotic form which we shall\\n      shortly describe.\\n      \\n Pathological Anatomy.-The acute\\n      nephritic lesion is essentially a glomerulitis, desquamative and with\\n      variable alteration in the tubular epithelium, infiltration of the\\n      interstitial tissue by round cells, catarrhal inflammation of the straight\\n      tubes, and inflammation of the arterioles.\\n      \\n The kidneys are considerably increased\\n      in size; they ar sometimes hard and tense, sometimes soft. Hyperplasia is\\n      found only in the cortical substance. Divested of their envelope the\\n      kidneys are found sometimes of uniform redness, or sometimes presenting a\\n      mottled aspect tinged with yellow. The pyramids show a more or less violet\\n      red tint.\\n      \\n Microscopical Examination.-More or less\\n      advanced inflammation of the glomeruli, which are not all in the same\\n      condition; some are congested, others anaemic, some normal. Albuminous and\\n      granular exudations from certain capsules take place. At other times the\\n      exudations are haemorrhagic. The tubuli are in general dilated somewhat.\\n      The epithelial cells are infiltrated with fat; sometimes pale cylinders,\\n      sometimes red globules, the result of haemorrhages, fill the loops of\\n      Henle and the straight canal. The connective stroma is not intact; it is\\n      oedematous, and shows round cells, more or less confluent, which indicate\\n      a certain degree of interstitial nephritis. Lastly, the small arterioles\\n      show cylindrical of fusiform thickening, which is the beginning of an\\n      obliteration of these arterioles.\\n      \\n This lesion is susceptible of complete\\n      recovery, at least if we may believe clinical experience. In other cases\\n      it ends with death. It may also end by passage into the chronic state. And\\n      in this case we have to study the evolution of a lesion which ends sooner\\n      or later in interstitial nephritis.\\n      \\n This conclusion is not that of\\n      authorities who allow the absolute separation of parenchymatous from\\n      interstitial nephritis, but is typical of acute nephritis, parenchymatous\\n      in character, having burst forth, either on occasion of typhoid fever,\\n      scarlet fever or some other infectious disease, or even in consequence of\\n      the effect of cold, and being terminated after several years by the\\n      symptoms and lesions of interstitial nephritis.\\n      \\n It is impossible to deny the morbid\\n      transformation of one of these lesions into the other.\\n      \\n The large red kidneys, more or less\\n      mottled with yellow and gray, soft or indurated, are transformed when the\\n      disease passes to the chronic state into the large white kidneys. Then, by\\n      a continuation of the evolution into small granular kidneys, retracted,\\n      white or red.\\n      \\n In the acute period the interstitial\\n      tissue is but little attacked. We find at most a few round cells\\n      interposed here and there in form of a trial between the tubules and at\\n      the openings of the arterioles. But the longer the disease the more are\\n      interstitial lesions noticed, leading by their evolution to atrophy and\\n      retraction of the kidney. Thus, facts show us that parenchymatous\\n      nephritis, when it passes to the chronic state, assumes all the characters\\n      of interstitial nephritis.\\n      \\n CHAPTER II.-INTERSTITIAL NEPHRITIS.\\n      \\n We have already said that interstitial\\n      nephritis depends upon arterio-sclerosis.\\n      \\n The beginning of interstitial nephritis\\n      often passes unperceived; it is characterized by polyuria and polydipsia,\\n      analogous to that of diabetes. There is perceived at the same time\\n      increase in arterial tension. It is to this increase of arterial tension\\n      that we should attribute the symptom of the \"dead finger,\"\\n      deemed by Dieulafoy a sign of nephritis without albuminuria.\\n      \\n In this first period, as a matter of\\n      fact, albuminuria shows itself often only in a transitory way, at long\\n      intervals, and in quantity estimated with difficulty. As we have already\\n      said the urine is very abundant; it is pale, of very low specific gravity,\\n      which varies from 1002 to 1012, containing a quantity of urea less than\\n      normal. he urine is slightly turbid, and may reach 2, 3 and 9 litres.\\n      \\n Patients are often tormented by\\n      continual headache. Anorexia, vomiting, or diarrhoea, dimness of vision,\\n      and amaurosis are observed in this form as in the preceding, but \"in\\n      interstitial nephritis, amaurosis is related, not to a primitive\\n      alteration in the elements of the retina, but to a sclerotic alteration of\\n      the optic nerve and of the retina.\" (Lancereau.).\\n      \\n OEdema may be completely lacking during\\n      nearly all the course of the disease. It is only when the nephritis has\\n      lasted for years, and when the patient becomes cachectic, that a certain\\n      degree of dropsy is evident, while at the same time albumin may reach 1,2,\\n      and 3 grammes per litre.\\n      \\n We must call attention to the cardiac\\n      symptoms which always accompany interstitial nephritis.\\n      \\n We have already referred to arterial\\n      tension. We must add to it hypertrophy of the heart and the \"bruit de\\n      gallop,\" which is often so diagnostic of this disease.\\n      \\n We must not forget, moreover, that\\n      interstitial nephritis is only an affection of arterio-sclerosis, and\\n      consequently that it may be accompanied by the cardiac, pulmonary,\\n      hepatic, and cerebral symptoms peculiar to this lesion of the arteries.\\n      \\n Interstitial nephritis progresses\\n      slowly, and is prolonged for years. It shows, from one time to another,\\n      periods of aggravation, characterized either by bloody and scanty urine or\\n      by the appearance of oedema, or, above all, by manifestations of uraemic\\n      symptoms, of which we shall speak in a moment. These aggravations are\\n      always due to errors of diet or to failure to observe the rules of health;\\n      subsequently, an amelioration, more or less complete, takes place, and\\n      thus the disease is prolonged through many years.\\n      \\n Almost always death comes from uraemic\\n      accidents, which may assume two principal forms, pulmonary and cerebral.\\n      \\n In the pulmonary form the patient is\\n      seized by paroxysmal dyspnoea, which comes especially at night, and which\\n      may be accompanied by pulmonary congestion, with expectoration of rust-\\n      colored sputum. This dyspnoea may lead to the death of the patient.\\n      \\n The cerebral form is much more\\n      frequent. A number of patients show symptoms of cerebral apoplexy,\\n      together with hemiplegia, and die comatose.\\n      \\n Others have veritable attacks of\\n      eclampsia, more or less intense and more or less lasting, taking, in\\n      severe cases, a subintrant course, such that the patient are in a\\n      veritable \"etat de mal,\" and die comatose.\\n      \\n Other patients resist uraemic\\n      eclampsia. Some gain their health completely, at least in appearance, and\\n      my yet live for a long time after having experienced its attack.\\n      \\n Uraemic accidents are always ushered in\\n      by a considerable diminutions in the quantity of urine, just as\\n      amelioration is accompanied by abundant diuresis. Dimness of vision,\\n      increase in headaches, slight twitching of the limbs often precede and\\n      usher in serious uraemic accidents.\\n      \\n Aetiology.-The causes of interstitial\\n      nephritis are first and foremost the causes of arterio-sclerosis. Abuse of\\n      strong liquors, life in a damp locality, and chilling of the body are\\n      circumstances which favor localization of arterio-sclerosis in the kidney.\\n      \\n Pathological Anatomy.-In interstitial\\n      nephritis the two kidneys are invaded almost equally. In the first stage\\n      the lesion is characterized by congestion and increase in the volume of\\n      the kidney; the capsule is easily detached form the organ; the parenchyma,\\n      slightly soft and pale, varies in color from red to gray, and is sown with\\n      capillary dilatation. On section, the cortical substance is brownish, with\\n      gray or white stains, the medullary substance of a violet hue.\\n      Histological examination shows a more or less abundant proliferation of\\n      embryonic elements spread unequally throughout the cortical substance, and\\n      seizing upon the connective and vascular tissue of the region of the\\n      convoluted canaliculi and of the corpuscles of Malpighi. Sometimes the\\n      Malpighian glomeruli are the seat of a haemorrhage which becomes mixed\\n      with the urine.\\n      \\n The kidney diminishes gradually in\\n      volume, its tissue is retracted, and its surface becomes roughened in all\\n      its extent. The kidney takes on a solid and coriaceous consistency; its\\n      capsule becomes adherent and is removed with difficulty. More or less\\n      numerous cysts are formed. Atrophy of the kidney takes place upon the\\n      cortical substance, which is sometimes reduced to a millimetre. The round\\n      cells, of which we have already spoken, stretch out and form fusiform\\n      bodies soon to be transformed into cicatricial tissue.\\n      \\n Next retraction supervenes, with\\n      atrophy of the convoluted tubes and of the glomeruli.\\n      \\n The epithelia of the tubes undergo a\\n      granulo-fatty degeneration, and end by disappearing.\\n      \\n The lesion, having arrived at its last\\n      stage, shows the kidneys reduced to the size of large chestnut, and in\\n      weight 190 grammes, [About six ounces Troy.] partly transformed into\\n      fibrous tissue, and then constituting that which is called the small red\\n      kidney.\\n      \\n The renal artery is, like most of the\\n      arteries of the body, attacked by arterio-sclerosis.\\n      \\n It is useless to describe here the\\n      lesions common to arterio-sclerosis and to gout, of which interstitial\\n      nephritis constitutes only an affection.\\n      \\n Differential Diagnosis Between the Two\\n      Nephritis.-This paragraph is perhaps superfluous. We wish, however, to\\n      call to mind that true bright\\'s disease is distinguished form interstitial\\n      nephritis by the intensity of the anasarca and by urine so well marked in\\n      character, namely, scanty and loaded with albumin; while in interstitial\\n      nephritis the urine is exceedingly abundant, with albumin scanty, or but a\\n      trace. Cardiac symptoms; hypertrophy of the heart, the \"bruit de\\n      gallop;\" Cardiac symptoms of aortitis; arterial tension, and more or\\n      less general arterio- sclerosis serve to distinguish interstitial\\n      nephritis and permit us to recognize it.\\n      \\n Prognosis in Bright\\'s Disease.-The\\n      prognosis of Bright\\'s disease is always grave. This disease is terminated\\n      usually by death in the first days of the malady, or by passage into the\\n      chronic state, the termination of which is always fatal. However, it is\\n      necessary to remember that complete recovery from Bright\\'s disease may\\n      take place. I have records of recovery in cases dating back more than\\n      thirty years.\\n      \\n Sings Pointing to Recovery in Bright\\'s\\n      Disease.-Diminution of the fever and of the anasarca, but, above all,\\n      increase in the quantity. All the same time strength and appetite return,\\n      but recovery is not assured until albumin has completely disappeared, and\\n      until the urine has resumed its ordinary color, density and chemical\\n      composition.\\n      \\n We should not forget that, if recovery\\n      is possible, this possibility exists only in the first period of the\\n      disease and before the lesions of interstitial nephritis are produced.\\n      \\n Sings of death are, in the first days,\\n      an increase in the febrile movement, diminution in the quantity of urine\\n      and, most commonly, the appearance of uraemic symptoms; convulsions or\\n      coma.\\n      \\n Sometimes erysipelas supervenes as a\\n      complication, or some other inflammation, as bronchitis, pneumonia,\\n      pleurisy or pericarditis.\\n      \\n The signs of passage into the chronic\\n      condition, and change form parenchymatous to interstitial nephritis, are\\n      as follows: profound anaemia and lack of color in the integuments;\\n      sometimes the urine remains scanty and contains much albumin, with\\n      persistence of the anasarca; gastric symptoms appear (anorexia, vomiting,\\n      which is often obstinate, frequent and continual diarrhoea); often oedema\\n      of the lung and hydrothorax complicate the condition of the patient. Death\\n      comes from exhaustion, asphyxia or inflammation of the lungs.\\n      \\n In other cases the progress is slower.\\n      The patient may return to a condition of health, doubtless incomplete, but\\n      which permits a fairly long survival. The urine becomes more abundant and\\n      clearer, always remaining albuminous; anasarca diminishes, and the disease\\n      takes upon itself, more or less, the pace and termination of interstitial\\n      nephritis.\\n      \\n Prognosis in Interstitial\\n      Nephritis.-The prognosis is that of a disease of very long duration, but\\n      absolutely incurable. If the patient is subjected to the proper diet, he\\n      may live for many years, with every appearance of health. We have already\\n      said that he usually falls a victim to uraemic accidents, and the\\n      prognostic sign which cases us to fear these accidents is drawn absolutely\\n      from the quantity and the quality of the urine. As long as the urine is\\n      abundant and not too poor in urea, as long as its density reaches 1012,\\n      the physician may rest easy; but as soon as the urine diminishes in\\n      quantity, while at the same time urea falls to very small quantities, we\\n      must expect to see uraemic symptoms burst forth.\\n      \\n Treatment of Acute Bright\\'s Disease.-In\\n      the beginning, when the urine is scanty, bloody and albuminous, when there\\n      is pain in the region of the kidneys and general anasarca, the indicated\\n      remedies are: Belladonna, Cantharides, Apium virus, Koch\\'s lymph, Iodium.\\n      \\n 1. Belladonna.-This is the remedy in\\n      the beginning. We should give it preference over the other three when\\n      fever is present, with headache and vomiting; scanty urine colored red b\\n      haemato-globulin (haemoglobin) confirms us in its choice.\\n      \\n Does and method of Administration: The\\n      first three dilutions: Six drops in 200 grammes of water (about seven\\n      fluid ounces). A teaspoonful every two hours.\\n      \\n 2. Cantharides.-The symptoms and\\n      lesions of acute Bright\\'s disease correspond exactly to the symptoms and\\n      lesions produced by poisoning with Cantharides. The experiments of Galippe\\n      put this fact beyond doubt, and in later days Lancereau has held, before\\n      the Academy of Medicine, that the best remedy for albuminuria is\\n      Cantharides. This is truly scandalous, and reply has been made that\\n      Cantharides may be very dangerous in the treatment of albuminuria, since\\n      it causes nephritis. It goes without saying that this objection is of no\\n      consequence to the disciples of Hahnemann. Cantharides is suitable in the\\n      treatment of Bright\\'s disease at all times when the urine, containing\\n      albumin and blood in abundance, is passed in small quantity, together with\\n      tenesmus. We should administer it after the beginning, when there is no\\n      fever, or when Belladonna has reduced the temperature. Cantharides acts\\n      very promptly. Its first effect is to cause blood to disappear from the\\n      urine and to increase the quantity of urine considerably. It is not\\n      unusual to see the urine reach 2, 3 and 4 litres from the first days of\\n      the administration of Cantharides.\\n      \\n Dose and Method of Administration: We\\n      seldom prescribe the tincture, and then never more than three drops a day\\n      of it. We have been most rapidly successful by the use of the first\\n      dilutions, administered as in the case of belladonna.\\n      \\n 3. Apium Virus.-The position of the\\n      honey-bee, in its action upon acute nephritis, has great analogy to that\\n      of Cantharides, but it is more particularly indicated when there is\\n      considerable anasarca. In my clinical lessons of 1892 may be found\\n      observations on a case of acute Bright\\'s disease, very rapidly helped by\\n      the poison of the honey-bee, with a diuresis which exceeded three litres a\\n      day. Apium virus lacks at present sufficiently extensive clinical\\n      confirmation, but we know enough about this remedy not to hesitate to\\n      prescribe it when the indications are present which I have mentioned.\\n      \\n 4. Koch\\'s Lymph.-Clinical observations\\n      and experiments upon animals have shown that injection of Koch\\'s lymph\\n      produce parenchymatous nephritis together with Albuminous urine. I am not\\n      aware of the sings which allow us to determine the indications for the use\\n      of this remedy in the acute stage of Bright\\'s disease; therefore I have\\n      almost always reserved its use for the chronic period of this disease, and\\n      also for the treatment of interstitial nephritis. We know that in these\\n      two cases the lesions of the kidney are established, and that, in\\n      consequence, we cannot hope for a radical cure. Whenever we have\\n      prescribed Koch\\'s lymph in such cases, we have obtained an amelioration\\n      characterized by considerable diminution of albumin and by amelioration of\\n      the general health.\\n      \\n Dose and method of Administration: We\\n      have never made hypodermic injections in the treatment of the nephritis.\\n      We have confined ourselves to prescribing Koch\\'s lymph in the sixth or\\n      third dilution; three doses a day for six days. Cease giving the remedy\\n      from one to four days following the effect obtained, then begin again.\\n      \\n 5. Iodium.-This is a remedy which we\\n      shall find suitable to the treatment of interstitial nephritis, but it has\\n      also given very good results in the treatment of Bright\\'s disease, which\\n      is still acute. The dose in this case has been one of the first\\n      triturations of the Iodide of sodium. The other remedies indicated in the\\n      treatment of chronic Bright\\'s disease, or in interstitial nephritis, are\\n      Lead, Arsenic, Phosphorus, Mercury, Nitric acid, etc.\\n      \\n If we should wish to enumerate all the\\n      drugs which may produce interstitial nephritis, with passage of albumin\\n      into the urine, the list would be long; but I do not believe that the\\n      physician would derive great benefit from use of them.\\n      \\n Phosphorus, and especially Phosphoric\\n      acid, produced the majority of the symptoms of interstitial nephritis. But\\n      have they ever cured a single case of this affection?.\\n      \\n As to Plumbum, no drug presents a more\\n      complete image, not only of interracial nephritis, but even of general\\n      arterio- sclerosis, and yet I have never obtained results from the use of\\n      this drug. Possibly I have not administered the preparation in suitable\\n      dose. Plumbum should always be studied in connection with the treatment of\\n      chronic inflammations of the kidney.\\n      \\n Dose and Method of Administration: We\\n      use almost always the three first triturations of the Iodide of sodium.\\n      Administered, as we have said, in the case of Apium virus. In rebellious\\n      cases, we have found it well to administer several centigrammes (a\\n      centigrammes equals about one-sixth of a grain) of the crude drug.\\n      \\n We have not mentioned Fuchsine, nor\\n      Methyl blue, nor so many other substances, heralded as panaceas in\\n      Bright\\'s disease, which have been forgotten as soon as discovered.\\n      \\n Treatment of Uraemic\\n      Accidents.-Sometimes we do not hesitate to prescribe copious bleeding when\\n      eclampsia or uraemic coma shows itself in strong patients, and in those\\n      who are still in the acute period of the disease.\\n      \\n Moreover, this practice had, and still\\n      has, its very earnest advocates for uraemic accidents which show\\n      themselves pregnancy. We do not absolutely condemn its use, not\\n      understanding entirely its mode of action, we never employ it.\\n      \\n Chloroform, Belladonna, and its\\n      succedaneum, Opium, and, lastly, in certain cases, purgatives, indications\\n      for which we shall try to determine, constitute the means which we\\n      habitually use in the treatment of uraemic accidents.\\n      \\n 1. Chloroform.-Chloroform is an heroic\\n      remedy for attacks of eclampsia, to which it is, moreover, absolutely\\n      Homoeopathic. It is universally accepted by physicians and accoucheurs.\\n      \\n Does and Method of Administration: The\\n      most energetic method of administering Chloroform consists in giving\\n      inhalations so as to produce anaesthesia. Suspend administration of the\\n      drug when convulsions have ceased, beginning again when they commence in\\n      turn. In practice, Chloroform is often replaced by Chloral, because the\\n      presence of a physician is not required for the administration of this\\n      latter remedy. It is more convenient to administer it in enemata, in doses\\n      of 4 grammes (about 62 grains), in the case of adults. The action of\\n      Chloral is slower and also more prolonged than that of Chloroform. Its\\n      administration may be renewed whenever the anaesthetic sleep ceases and\\n      convulsion begin again.\\n      \\n 2. Belladonna, Aethusa Cynapium.-These\\n      were our two principal remedies before the discovery of Chloroform.\\n      \\n Belladonna and AEthusa are indicated in\\n      the eclamptic form of Uraemia. Moreover, Belladonna is still indicated\\n      during uraemic coma, when the pupil is dilated, the face pale, and the\\n      pulse frequent. In the cases in which delirium comes on, then again we\\n      must have recourse to Belladonna.\\n      \\n Dose and method of Administration: The\\n      three first decimal dilutions, one drop every quarter of an hour, in cases\\n      of eclampsia; in other cases, one drop every two hours.\\n      \\n 3. Opium.-This drug is indicated in\\n      uraemic coma, with contracted pupils, red face, pulse full and slow. it is\\n      also indicated in uraemic dyspnoea.\\n      \\n Dose and Method of Administration: I\\n      prescribe usually the first triturations, twenty centigrammes (about three\\n      grains) in a hundred grammes (about three fluid ounces) of water. A\\n      teaspoonful every two or three hours. In cases in which patients cannot\\n      swallow, or swallow with difficulty, I have found it well to inject, by\\n      the hypodermic method, Tincture of opium, one in one hundred; that is to\\n      say, the first dilution, this dilution being made in distilled water.\\n      \\n In uraemic dyspnoea it is preferable to\\n      inject eight or ten drops of a solution of Morphine, one in one hundred,\\n      this drug being absolutely Homoeopathic to dyspnoea. Injections may be\\n      renewed every two or four hours.\\n      \\n Jaborandi and its alkaloid,\\n      Pilocarpine, and also transfusion of blood, have been lauded, but these\\n      are agents which are essentially dangerous.\\n      \\n 4. Drastic Purgatives.-Although\\n      treatment by drastic purgatives has nothing Homoeopathic about it, and\\n      although it is solely a question of their physiological action, which is\\n      to withdraw a great quantity of water from the system, we should,\\n      nevertheless, not reject them entirely,and in desperate cases, in which\\n      standard remedies have been without effect, purgation may lead to a\\n      considerable amelioration, especially when uraemic accidents ar\\n      characterized by coma and very general anasarca.\\n      \\n As a rule, use of purgatives has only a\\n      palliative effect, and the amelioration it produces has but slight\\n      duration.\\n      \\n Method of Administration: We use\\n      usually German brandy, forty grammes (a little over a fluid ounce)\\n      sweetened with twenty grammes (a little less than a fluid ounce) of syrup\\n      of Nerprun (Buckthorn).\\n      \\n Diet and Hygienic Precautions in\\n      Bright\\'s Disease.-Absolute milk diet is perfection in acute Bright\\'s\\n      disease, and also during the outbreaks which come on in the course of the\\n      disease, when the nephritis has passed into the chronic state. The patient\\n      should take three or four litres (about three or four quarts) of milk a\\n      day, in small doses repeated every two hours; the milk may be boiled or\\n      not, salted, sweetened or natural.\\n      \\n It is carrying matters to a dangerous\\n      extreme to prescribe an absolute milk diet for patients in all stages and\\n      in all forms Bright\\'s disease.\\n      \\n When the patient is better-when his\\n      health has, at least, apparently returned-we should advise the mixed milk\\n      diet, which consists in the administration of one or two litres of milk\\n      diluted in part in the form of soup. We may allow at the same time\\n      poultry, ham, fish, and also, a little later, mutton and beef. Eggs may\\n      also be allowed albuminuric patients,except during the acute period.\\n      \\n Alcohol should be absolutely forbidden.\\n      In the purely chronic period we may, however, permit a little while wine,\\n      red wine or cider diluted with water.\\n      \\n Finally, the physician has an accurate\\n      thermometer for guiding him in the alimentation of his patients, namely,\\n      the condition of the urine. If the urine reached a litre and a half or two\\n      litres (three to four paints), if the urea approaches its normal quantity,\\n      of albumin is diminishing, we may relax the diet much. But if, on the\\n      contrary, the urine diminishes much, while at the same time the specific\\n      gravity falls below 1010, and the albumin increases in quantity, it\\n      becomes necessary to return to the absolute milk diet.\\n      \\n The patient should keep up the\\n      functions of the skin, and consequently its cleanliness, by washing and by\\n      hot baths. He should shun damp cold, and, if it is possible, spend the\\n      winter in hot countries. He should take moderate exercise, and should shun\\n      prolonged muscular efforts.\\n      \\n Hydrotherapy, which has been advised by\\n      several physicians, has has not kept good the promises which were made in\\n      its name, and I do not venture to advise its use.\\n      \\n DISCUSSION.\\n      \\n GEO. M. DILLOW, M.D.: I am sorry that\\n      circumstances have so shaped themselves as to make it too difficult for me\\n      to attend the Congress and thus to fulfil my provisional promise to\\n      comment on Dr. P. Jousset\\'s paper on Bright\\'s disease. My regret is the\\n      greater because the important and ability of the paper should command the\\n      highest respect I could offer. I should find it difficult, however, to\\n      compress the little that might interest in a ten minutes\\' speech, for my\\n      views differ in many respects fro those of the learned author of the\\n      paper, and I could not express them satisfactory even in a much longer\\n      space of time. But I wish to offer something which you can use in part or\\n      whole at your pleasure, in case there is no other speaker to fill my\\n      place.\\n      \\n Let me say that, as regards the main\\n      contention, the presents state of knowledge does not appear to me to\\n      warrant restriction of the term, Bright\\'s disease, to any one of the\\n      recognized forms of nephritis, and that it seems less likely to lead to\\n      further confusion if we keep the term, as most generally used, in the\\n      generic sense, to cover all forms of primitive renal inflammation which\\n      suppress the function of the kidney by destruction of its essential\\n      element, viz., the glomerulo-tubular system. By whatever name the process\\n      may be called, and wherever beginning, this is the ultimate result of\\n      every form, of nephritis, and it is to the result, and largely by reason\\n      of its gravity, that the term Bright\\'s disease specially applies. One has\\n      only to be familiar with many authorities and to follow up diagnosis by\\n      post-mortem investigation to realize that schematic descriptions do not so\\n      often correspond with the anatomical types predicted and pathological\\n      processes predicated. Instead of the so-called typical kidneys, we often\\n      find many departures; and if, as histologists, we search them all, we find\\n      always inflammatory changes involving all the elements of the cortex,\\n      tubules, glomerulus, interstitial structure, and bloodvessels, though\\n      present in different degrees, combined in different ways, and associated\\n      more or less with degenerative lesions. Whether there are one, two, or\\n      more distinct pathological process involved, or whether there is only one,\\n      modified by many aetiological factors, which act in such a way as to\\n      determine varying evolution, duration, intensity, extent and degeneration,\\n      thus giving rise to a varying symptomatology, I do not feel prepared to\\n      say, but, as practical clinicians, it is safer to leave the pathologists\\n      to fight out their battle to the finish before we preoccupy our minds with\\n      the partisan views of any one of the contending authorities. We cannot say\\n      with some that interstitial nephritis only is Bright\\'s disease; or that\\n      others, that parenchymatous nephritis only is Bright\\'s disease; or that\\n      Bright\\'s disease does not include other intermediate and mixed forms. It\\n      is best to regard it as an ensemble of symptoms and lesions, variously\\n      combined, differing in evolution, but always presenting a family\\n      resemblance in albuminuria and uraemic manifestations, and in glomerular\\n      and tubular destruction.\\n      \\n The confusion into which we would be\\n      thrown by accepting Dr. Jousset\\'s position is well illustrated by the\\n      effects of lead upon the kidneys. Using the term parenchymatous nephritis\\n      in its purely pathological sense, we should understand an inflammation\\n      where the initial lesions ar primarily in the tubal epithelia, which we\\n      take to be the parenchyma of the kidney. It is a curious fact that the\\n      best established example of this parenchymatous process should be the\\n      so-called simple interstitial nephritis of lead-poisoning, which Dr.\\n      Jousset rules out of the category of Bright\\'s disease. Charcot and\\n      Gambault have demonstrated that the lesions first observed in animals\\n      poisoned by repeated fractional doses of white lead are in the epithelia\\n      of Henle\\'s loops, rapidly passing latter into the epithelia of the\\n      convoluted tubules and of Bowman\\'s capsule. The epithelia swell, flatten\\n      through mutual pressure in distended tubules, break down into embryonal\\n      (inflammatory) corpuscles; or in other words, proliferate, whence follow\\n      atrophy and collapse of the tubes with growth of connective tissue. The\\n      large vessels show no lesions. The arterioles, only in the later period,\\n      are affected in their outer coat, and the glomerular capillaries remain\\n      intact during nearly the whole duration of the experimental disease. Here,\\n      then, is a typical parenchymatous inflammation, the lesion of the\\n      glandular structure being primary, and the interstitial and vascular\\n      lesions being secondary; and yet here also is the purest type of so-called\\n      interstitial nephritis, which end in the small, red, granular kidney, and\\n      an inflammation which is also claimed to be dependent upon\\n      arteriosclerosis.\\n      \\n Time does not permit me to analyze the\\n      author\\'s descriptions of the two types of nephritis presented, which, of\\n      so brief a paper, are most admirably, if too rigorously, summarized. I\\n      cannot, however, permit the opportunity to pass without expression of\\n      dissent from his view of the relations of the cardio-vascular system to\\n      both parenchymatous and interstitial nephritis. In his parenchymatous\\n      nephritis (I have to say his to distinguish it from the parenchymatous\\n      nephritis of some other authors), which includes the large and small white\\n      kidneys and also the mixed forms of kidneys, common in practice,\\n      observation of the heart and arterial tension furnishes clues for\\n      diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment not second in value to any other\\n      source of information. In his interstitial nephritis, while I recognize\\n      that some cases are joined to generalized arteriosclerosis, I believe that\\n      oftener the two processes run concurrently under the action of a common\\n      cause, and that still more often the renal inflammation precedes the\\n      general arterio- sclerosis and cardiac hypertrophy, of which it is the\\n      inducing factor. Even upon his own statement the balance of experimental\\n      evidence is in favor of the production of cardiac hypertrophy (and so\\n      presumably high arterial tension) by trying of the renal artery and\\n      removal of a kidney, and if we add to his experiments by ligature of the\\n      ureter, we find cardiac hypertrophy following the nephritis thereby\\n      induced. But, leaving experiments aside, the clinical facts are against\\n      his position. High arterial tension and dilatation of the heart are\\n      common, even almost constant, in certain stages of acute and chronic\\n      parenchymatous nephritis; early hypertrophy even occurs in scarletinal\\n      nephritis occasionally, and the very statistics cited by Dr. Jousset\\n      indicate that hypertrophy was not exceptional in the cases under\\n      examination. His appeal to Bamberger\\'s cases does not sustain his position\\n      of exceptional occurrence. Bamberger\\'s 344 hypertrophied hearts existed in\\n      a total of 807 cases of \"primitive Bright\\'s disease,\"\\n      \"acute,\" \"chronic.\" and \"atrophic;\" 207 of\\n      these 344 hypertrophied were with \"atrophic\" kidneys; 122 with\\n      \"chronic,\" probably large (parenchymatous) kidneys; and 15 with\\n      \"acute;\" but what proportion the several \"acute\"\\n      \"chronic,\" and \"atrophic\" cases bore to the whole 807,\\n      and in what percentage of each form hypertrophied hearts existed, cannot\\n      be inferred. All that we can say is, that 122 hypertrophies argue not\\n      exceptional but frequent occurrence; and that, had we the data for\\n      reaching a proper estimate, Bamberger\\'s statistics probably would show a\\n      proportion approximating one-half cardiac hypertrophies to the whole\\n      number of parenchymatous cases. But putting aside the argument from\\n      Bamberger as not being conclusive, we find that Dr. Jousset has\\n      misconceived Galabin\\'s statistics. Galabin\\'s 101 cases numbered 65\\n      hypertrophied hearts instead of 34, as the author of the paper asserts; 66\\n      of the 101 were granular kidneys, with 53 cardiac hypertrophies; 22 were\\n      example of tubal (parenchymatous) nephritis, of which 11 had cardiac\\n      hypertrophy; 13 were waxy kidneys, with 1 hypertrophied heart. Vius showed\\n      14hypertrophies out of 20 cases of parenchymatous nephritis; Ewald (not\\n      cited in the paper), 5 out of 10. Thus, according to the statistics\\n      appealed to, fully one-half the cases of chronic parenchymatous nephritis\\n      had cardiac hypertrophy. If, now, with this correction, we accept\\n      Labadie-Lagrave\\'s assertion that dilatation is the rule in parenchymatous\\n      nephritis, we arrive at the conclusion that either dilatation or\\n      hypertrophy, or both, obtain more commonly than a heart of normal size in\\n      chronic parenchymatous nephritis. This is substantially the conclusion of\\n      Lecorche and Salamon. Familiarity with their work makes it difficult for\\n      me to conceive how the author of the paper could have so misconceived\\n      their meaning as to write that \"they plainly exaggerate when they\\n      speak of hypertrophy of the heart as a constant lesion in this\\n      disease\" (parenchymatous nephritis). I have been unable to find\\n      anywhere in this book any such assertion, and such exaggeration as there\\n      maybe is on the side that claims that it is exceptional. What lecorche and\\n      Salamon have stated is exemplified in the following extract from their\\n      work (pp. 624, 625):.\\n      \\n \"In the question of diagnosis,\\n      determination of the state of the heart is one of the principal points. In\\n      a general way, it can be said that the degree of hypertrophy measures the\\n      degree of atrophy of the kidney. When the left ventricle only is increased\\n      in size, it can be affirmed that the bright\\'s disease is old, whatever may\\n      be the acute appearances revealed by the actual episode, and that a slow\\n      and latent phase of atrophy has preceded the acute attack under\\n      observation. Two great categories of Bright\\'s disease can be established\\n      according to whether or not cardiac hypertrophy is associated with the\\n      symptoms of Bright\\'s, whatever may be these symptoms, and, in particular,\\n      the physical and chemical character of the urine.\\n      \\n \"If the heart is normal, or simply\\n      dilated, it is surely a matter of a large kidney, soft, red, mottled or\\n      white.\\n      \\n \"If a middling (moderate)\\n      hypertrophy of the heart exist, the anatomical characters of the kidney\\n      are those of one of the forms which we have described under the name of\\n      intermediate evolutionary forms, or a small kidney atrophied rapidly by\\n      successive attacks close together-this kidney showing the appearance of a\\n      red granular kidney, and more often of a white contracted kidney.\\n      \\n \"If, finally, the cardiac\\n      hypertrophy is enormous, there is no doubt of the small red kidney,\\n      contracted by slow and progressive atrophy.\\n      \\n \"These rules are true, and ought\\n      to guide in the immense majority of cases. But, as with every pathological\\n      law, one should not lose sight of exceptions. Cardiac hypertrophy can\\n      develop rapidly in the course of acute and subacute nephritis, as has been\\n      noted apropos of scarletinal nephritis. In these precocious hypertrophies\\n      dilatation outweighs the hypertrophy, properly speaking; but clinically it\\n      is not easy to make the distinction, and by relying on observation of the\\n      heart, it is easy to deceive one\\'s self upon the duration and real\\n      appearance of the renal lesions.\\n      \\n \"In the second place, there may be\\n      the following ensemble of symptoms: considerable hypertrophy of the heart\\n      without valvular lesions; generalized atheroma-traces of albumin in the\\n      urine, which is pale, poor in urea and solids. Clinically, it is difficult\\n      to avoid error. There are the symptoms of the small, contracted kidney by\\n      progressive atrophy, and yet the autopsy shows large red kidneys, smooth\\n      and of normal appearance. Shall it be said that because the microscope\\n      shows a few glomerulic and tubular lesions, that it is bright\\'s disease?\\n      No; we must recognize that the clinician has been deceived, and that it is\\n      only a slight nephritis and an albuminuria, which has nothing to do with\\n      Bright\\'s disease in an atheromatous subject whose cardiac hypertrophy is\\n      explained by generalized arterio- sclerosis, and which has no connection\\n      with the state of the kidneys.\\n      \\n \"Finally, hypertrophy of the heart\\n      may rarely be absent in very pronounced granular atrophy\".\\n      \\n The points which I have intended to\\n      suggest in discussion have been the following: 1. That the field of\\n      Bright\\'s disease is larger than so-called parenchymatous nephritis: 2.\\n      That it includes so-called interstitial nephritis; 3. That Bright\\'s\\n      disease is more plural than duel or single in its anatomical forms of\\n      kidneys; 4. That its fundamental process or processes maybe essentially\\n      single rather than dual or plural, its evolution and varieties depending\\n      upon the aetiological factors at work in the individual case; 5. That\\n      interstitial nephritis is not commonly a late episode of a general\\n      arterio-sclerosis; 6. That arterio-sclerosis is itself a result of the\\n      nephritic lesion of Bright\\'s disease. 7. That the heart and vascular\\n      tension are altered in all the forms of bright\\'s disease. I should also\\n      like to emphasize the thought, which has grown upon me with experience,\\n      that behind the cases which we diagnosed as parenchymatous nephritis,\\n      acute or chronic, appearing without assignable cause, there has been a\\n      silent, latent period of renal atrophy similar to that demonstrated in\\n      experimental lead- poisoning, though not necessarily confined in its\\n      causes to lead, syphilis or gout; that there has been, in reality, a\\n      disease of long duration, which has been evolving by minor localized\\n      attacks of slight nephritis, remitting, renewing, slowly progressing,\\n      gradually disabling the kidneys part by part, yet without apparent\\n      disturbance of the general health, until, through some new exciting factor\\n      or an intensification of some cause previously existing, the remaining\\n      healthy portions of the renal parenchyma are extensively invaded by a more\\n      intense inflammation, when renal obstruction becomes manifest by\\n      circulatory symptoms, often including dropsy, and renal inadequacy shows\\n      itself in some of the manifold phenomena of uraemia. In thus suggestion\\n      that the so-called interstitial process may oftentimes precede the\\n      so-called parenchymatous process, and that the complex results of both\\n      processes, either singly or variously combined, is what we call Bright\\'s\\n      disease, there is the clinical inference that attentive examination of the\\n      urine for renal inadequacy and close observation of the cardio- vascular\\n      system should go hand in hand for correct diagnosis in all the forms of\\n      the disease.', u'Tresorie - LAW OF SIMILARS AND LAW OF CURE [Law Of Similars & Law of\\nCure]\\n\\n Ex-member of Homoeopathic State Faculty\\n      of Bengal.

Asthma was cured but a skin disease\\n      developed all over the body and there were much itching. He was again\\n      treated with allopathic medicine injections. The skin eruption was cured\\n      he was attacked with heart trouble and dilation of heart and much\\n      difficulty in breathing and suppression of urine and his condition was\\n      hopeless. However, he was saved by allopathic treatment when he has\\n      improved much, he was attacked with fever generally begins from 10 a.m. to\\n      1 p.m. and temperature rises upto 103 generally fever continues for 3 to 4\\n      hours and sometimes 8 to 9 hours. He feels hungry and thirsty before and\\n      during the fever. During the rise of fever he keeps clothes over his body.\\n      During fever he talks too much, abuses his family members and become very\\n      ill tempered when temperature rises to 102-103. He keeps quiet and does\\n      not like to move. During the falling temperature, he passes urine\\n      frequently. He has constipation and passes stool in 2 to 3 days. The stool\\n      is hard and offensive. The allopathic treatment was continued for a month\\n      without improvement. I was called on 3-5-54 and recorded the case and\\n      administered a dose of Nux Vom. 30 to antidote the action of the previous\\n      treatment. For 15 days Arsenic 30,200 Natrum Mur. 30,200. Phos 30, Sulph,\\n      200, Psorinum 200 were given by me but no improvement. Then I consulted a\\n      senior prominent Homoeopath. He tested the case with Laches. 200 and\\n      Tuberculinum Bovinum 200 for a week but no improvement. So the family\\n      members of the patient become very anxious and I was in much difficulty.\\n      Then I wished to try my interpretation of law and so recorded the case\\n      again according to the order of succession of symptoms. The patient and\\n      his family member said \"He feels very hungry and thirsty at 7 to 8\\n      a.m. and takes his food at 82 a.m. About 15 minutes after taking the meal\\n      he feels warm all over body and he covers his body with clothes and\\n      gradually temperature becomes very high. Generally after 3 to 4 hours\\n      temperature rises from 97* and during this time he becomes restless and\\n      tosses in the bed and talks much when his temperature becomes very high.\\n      Generally after 3 to 4 hours temperature rises 102 to 103 and then he\\n      remains quiet and does not like to move or to do any physical excise. High\\n      temperature remains about 2 hours and then it begins to fall. During this\\n      time he passes urine frequently in small quantity. In the evening his\\n      temperature becomes normal and he has sound sleep in the night.

W.Woodward M.D. in his\\n      Constitutional Therapeutics has also worked in this line. But it could not\\n      draw due notice of the homoeopathic world. In my mind it is high time to\\n      pay our attention on this subject for the progress of Homoeopathy.\\n      \\n LONDON LETTER\\n      \\n Its always good fun, at least, to see a\\n      surprised revival of belief in long forgotten or long discredited facts of\\n      theories.

Homoeopathy or homoeotherapy - call it what you will -\\n      isnt quite in the same class, because even here it has always retained\\n      some teachers and disciples; but for long they have been eyed askance as\\n      quacks and cranks, or something little better. Today they look to be\\n      gaining prestige, and are certainly gaining adherents, from the results of\\n      research by no less objective and authoritative a body than the Boyd\\n      Institute of Medical Research at Glasgow.\\n      \\n This work, it seems, began fifteen\\n      years ago. The scientists engaged upon in concerned themselves primarily\\n      to investigate the claims made for the infinitesimal doses of medicine\\n      used in homoeopathic practice. Was it true that these micro - doses could\\n      be effective? If their effect could be proved scientifically, could an\\n      answer also be found to the question \"Why\"? Which so far had\\n      baffled the homoeotherapists themselves?\\n      \\n The investigators answer to both\\n      questions in their discovery that a drug diluted almost to infinity, so\\n      that not one molecule of the original remains in the solution, retains a\\n      form of energy that does in fact act upon living cells. This surviving\\n      energy is still unidentified it will be pursued in further researches; but\\n      of its existence and effect the scientists at the Boyd Institute no longer\\n      have the smallest doubt.\\n      \\n Stripped of technicalities, and greatly\\n      over simplified their method may be described like this:\\n      \\n The crude drug was diluted in the ratio\\n      of one drop of the drug to 99 drops of the diluent. Vigorous shaking gave\\n      the mixture its first potency. One drop of it was then mixed with a\\n      further 99 drops of the diluent, and the \"shock\" treatment was\\n      repeated to produce the second potency. The same procedure was followed in\\n      subsequent attenuations, and in over a thousand carefully controlled\\n      experiments, until the thirtieth potency had been researched as 1 in,\\n      1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,\\n      000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 - which, I think, is one\\n      million five times over!\\n      \\n By this time, as I have said not so\\n      much as a molecule of the original drug remained; it was as if there were\\n      nothing but the purest and simplest water: yet the energy latent in the\\n      drug had apparently been liberated and increased by each successive\\n      violent shaking of the dilution, for its efficacy was proved by practical\\n      tests. One such test was made, and proved, by applying to the heart of a\\n      frog a dose derived, in the manner I have described, from the drug known\\n      as strophanthus.\\n      \\n We have, at present, only about 400\\n      convinced or luke warm homoeotherapists among our 20,000 family doctors.\\n      Their number now seems likely to increase.

[Continued ]\\n      \\n In the use of the so-called antithyroid\\n      substances, most noted propylthiouracil, the production of thyroid hormone\\n      is decreased. These compounds cause an enlargement and marked hyperplasia\\n      of the thyroid gland, with corresponding depression of metabolism and a\\n      decrease in the formation of thyroid hormones. The iodine content of the\\n      thyroid decreases, although the ability of the gland to trap iodine is not\\n      destroyed.\\n      \\n In considering the various diseases of\\n      the thyroid, for sake of brevity, we will deal with:\\n      \\n 1. Congenital Anomalies: These are of\\n      the aberrant type of thyroid and thyroglossal duct cysts, sinuses and\\n      fistulae.\\n      \\n 2. Thyroiditis:\\n      \\n a. Acute form - suppurative and\\n      non-suppurative.\\n      \\n b. Chronic - which comprises Simple;\\n      Reidels Struma; Hashimotos Disease; Specific infections (actinomycosis,\\n      syphilis and tuberculosis).\\n      \\n 3. Iodine Deficiency Goiter: Subiodic\\n      goiter; Simple goiter; colloid goiter - pubertal, Adolescent Gestational;\\n      Menopausal; Endemic; Sporadic.\\n      \\n 4. Hypothyroidism\" Adult myxedema;\\n      Cretinism; Juvenile myxedema.\\n      \\n 5. Non-Toxic Nodular Goiter, arising\\n      from pre - existing subiodic goiter, from pre - existing Graves disease,\\n      and fetal adenoma.\\n      \\n 6. Hyperthyroidism:\\n      \\n a. Graves Disease.\\n      \\n b. Plumbers Disease (toxic adenoma)\\n      \\n (1) Under the congenital anomalies or\\n      aberrant type of thyroids, we remember from the embryonic development of\\n      the thyroid, the path of its descent into its final location in the neck.\\n      Any variations which may occur during its descent will give rise to these\\n      aberrant thyroid itself. These are subject to the same cell changes which\\n      occur in the thyroid gland per se.\\n      \\n The thyroglossal duct cysts, it must be\\n      recalled, will be differentiated by the fact that they are in the midline.\\n      They may be ruptured and form a fistula which in turn may drain from time\\n      to time. They may a drain into the mouth if the duct cyst is above the\\n      hyoid bone.\\n      \\n In my experience there have been times\\n      when we have had a normal thyroid gland and have had a hyperactive\\n      aberrant gland located in some position in the neck which will give rise\\n      to thyroid - toxic symptoms. In these case we remove the aberrant gland.\\n      \\n The thyroglossal duct cysts usually are\\n      noted in the early years of life and do not harm unless their size\\n      produces a poor cosmetic effect and are removed for this reason; or due to\\n      some infection of the tract they will rupture and form a fistulous tract,\\n      which must be excised.\\n      \\n (2) A Thyroiditis - The acute form of\\n      thyroiditis will occur following some other form of infection through the\\n      body, such as pneumonia, bronchitis, diseased tonsils, or any other form\\n      of infection. As a rule, these cases will subside under treatment with the\\n      antibiotics or sulphonamids within 10 days to 3 weeks. Occasionally when\\n      there is suppuration, we will find pressure symptoms, high temperature;\\n      and of course radical incision and drainage of the affected site is\\n      surgically indicated.\\n      \\n B. In Chronic Thyroiditis, we must\\n      consider such conditions as Reidels Struma, Hashimotos Disease and the\\n      specific infections such as actinomycosis, syphilis and tuberculosis.\\n      \\n The Reidels Struma is known also as the\\n      Woody type of thyroiditis or the Ligneous type of goiter. In these cases,\\n      there is a dense struma throughout the gland which on section cuts almost\\n      like cartilage. Reidels struma does not occur too frequently\\n      (approximately 2 percent of all thyroidectomies have been performed upon\\n      Reidels struma). It is more common in women than in men. The clinical\\n      symptoms and signs of Reidels struma depend upon the presence of the\\n      goiter, the alterations of thyroid function, and the disturbance due to\\n      pressure. The gland is usually smooth except in about 30 percent of\\n      patients in whom a nodular goiter had previously existed. In about one -\\n      half of the cases bilateral involvement occurs. Malignancy must be\\n      differentiated in cases which had a pre - existing nodular goiter. There\\n      is one differential point in determining the diagnosis between Reidels\\n      struma and malignancy. In Reidels struma, the structures adjacent to the\\n      gland become adherent to the gland but are never fixed to the skin. When\\n      there is compression of the trachea or deviation of its structure, we may\\n      have unilateral laryngeal paralysis that is associated with hoarseness.\\n      \\n Early in this disease, signs of\\n      hyperthyroidism are present Later, as normal functioning tissue of the\\n      gland is encroached upon, there may be myxedema. The most striking\\n      symptoms are due to pressure. Dyspnoea is present in about 50 percent of\\n      the cases.\\n      \\n In Hashimotos Disease, we find that one\\n      per cent of all thyroidectomies were due to this type of pathological\\n      process. It course almost entirely in females. In this type of case,\\n      usually, the onset has been slow. The goiter has been present from three\\n      to five years. The patients nutrition usually is good. We will find\\n      pressure symptoms such as hoarseness, dysphagia, aphonia, tightness in the\\n      throat, a feeling of pressure over the neck, stridor, coughing and\\n      hoarseness. The gland is uniformly enlarged and is usually fixed to some\\n      neighboring structure, especially to the trachea. This type of chronic\\n      thyroiditis is amenable to X- ray therapy. However, since diagnosis is\\n      difficult in differentiation from carcinoma, these cases usually come to\\n      surgery. In the operative treatment of both these types of cases, due to\\n      the woody texture of the gland and its attachment to neigh - boring\\n      structures, particularly the trachea, we experience our greatest\\n      difficulty in thyroidectomy, because of danger of injury to the re -\\n      current laryngeal nerve. In most of these cases there already has been\\n      nerve involvement caused by the encroachment on the surrounding structures\\n      and it is here that we run into recurrent nerve paralysis. There is\\n      practically no tendency for this disease to recur after thyroidectomy.\\n      However, following operation, myxedema is very apt to occur and of occur\\n      the patient must then be kept on thyroid hormone.\\n      \\n In operating these types of patients,\\n      where the gland has developed and grown about the trachea or even\\n      posterior to the trachea, we must consider the danger of hemorrhage due to\\n      the numerous venous, spaces which are lateral and posterior to the\\n      trachea, and it is in these cases that we will experience our post -\\n      operative bleeding most frequency.\\n      \\n (3) Iodine Deficiency Goiter or Simple\\n      Goiter (Subiodic goiter) We find that these cases occur endemically in\\n      certain well defined geographic areas throughout the world. From its\\n      terminology, we can observe that it is due to a decrease in iodine storage\\n      capacity by the thyroid. A concentration of at least 1 percent of iodine\\n      must be maintained in the thyroid gland to prevent goiter. In regions\\n      throughout the world where there is a decrease in the amount of available\\n      iodine, especially over a long period of time throughout succeeding\\n      generation, we find the incidence of this type of goiter to be tremendous.\\n      We will find that males and females are equally affected. Many of these\\n      cases are affected from the time of birth. These cases vary in the gamut\\n      from frank cretinism, present at birth, to asymptomatic enlargement of the\\n      thyroid gland occurring at puberty. In the female, we find that pregnancy\\n      and menopause usually will cause a vast increase in the size of the gland.\\n      The gland enlarges because there is glandular hyperplasia and hypertrophy\\n      which are trying to produce a sufficient amount of thyroid hormone despite\\n      the relatively low iodine intake. After a goiter has been present a number\\n      of years, it is subject to degenerative processes which may result in\\n      hemorrhage into the gland.\\n      \\n In the treatment of these cases, early\\n      use of iodine, especially in the goiterous belts throughout the world,\\n      will give a prophylaxis against this type of disease. A small daily in\\n      take of iodine will be sufficient to cover the need and this may be\\n      supplied in the form of iodized salt. In its lieu, we may use one drop of\\n      Lugols solution per week. This will produce 8500 micrograms of iodine.\\n      Avoidance of an excess of goitrogenic substances in the diet, such as\\n      cabbage, is advised. If hypo thyroidism exists, dessicated thyroid\\n      substance in dosages from one - half to three grains daily is indicated.\\n      \\n It has been our practice for many years\\n      in this type of case to use many of the homoeopathic remedies. It must be\\n      remembered that the ancients treated their cases of goiter by\\n      administering sea - sponges which had been burnt. This will correspond to\\n      our present Spongia tosta. The small amount of iodine in this drug is\\n      responsible for its marked therapeutic effect. Other drugs which are\\n      commonly used are Iodine in potentized form and especially Red iodide of\\n      Mercury in our 3x triturate tablets.\\n      \\n This is especially indicated in case\\n      where there is associated hoarseness and metallic type of cough. In our\\n      practice we have found that many of the psychosomatic symptoms, such as\\n      nervousness, apprehension, so forth, are well cared for by the use of\\n      Actea racemosa and Pulsatilla.\\n      \\n (4) It would be wise at this time to\\n      mention Myxedema. These are the cases which have a reduction in the\\n      necessary thyroid hormones. The classical case of myxedema is known to all\\n      of us. Cretinism in the young is very easily distinguished. However, there\\n      are borderline cases of myxedema which often are overlooked. We should\\n      look for a generalized deposit of fat about the shoulders and upper trunk.\\n      Mentally, the patient is retarded and slow, there is lack of interest, a\\n      disinclination to work, sleepiness and a slow monotonous type of speech\\n      and there is usually a gain in weight. The hair is dry, coarse and\\n      brittle. However, these patients, if they are aware of these deficiencies\\n      in their psyche, may then develop nervousness, fretfulness or peevishness.\\n      We find in these cases that there is a decreased muscle tone in the heart,\\n      with feebleness of cardiac action. There will be a low pulse pressure,\\n      with increased capillary permeability.\\n      \\n Pathologically, the changes which occur\\n      in the thyroid gland are pressure, destruction of the cellular elements\\n      which the gland depends upon for the production of this hormone and\\n      eventually the small thyroid gland which is left, represents no more than\\n      is left in a totally thyroidectomized patient, so far as its functional\\n      ability; goes.\\n      \\n (5) Non - toxic Nodular Goiter -\\n      Colloid changes with nodule formation and degeneration are common in\\n      apparently normal people over 45 years of age. Their presence indicates a\\n      gradually diminishing activity of the thyroid gland.\\n      \\n Nodular goiters arise from simple or\\n      subiodic goiters, from chronic Thyroiditis, and in congenitally aberrant\\n      thyroid tissue. They may appear as a result of diffuse hyperplastic goiter\\n      with hyper - thyroidism. There is a tendency for the follicular cells to\\n      pile up on one another to form metaplastic masses which later, through\\n      growth and coalescence, give rise to readily palpable masses.\\n      \\n The overgrowth of these cells is\\n      thought to be due to an increased stimulation by the thyrotropic hormone\\n      of the pituitary. These nodular goiters are commonest in the endemic areas\\n      of the world. Adenomas arising in such cases are functionally less active\\n      than the surrounding normal tissue. They take up less radio active iodine\\n      and produce encapsulated lesions, or diffuse, multiple enlargements\\n      merging almost imperceptibly into the normal elements of the gland. They\\n      are rarely neoplastic, but rather a metaplasia of the normal glandular\\n      elements.\\n      \\n The importance of these, aside from\\n      their unsightliness, must be stressed because of the complications which\\n      may arise, namely, malignancy, pressure syndromes and thyrotoxicosis.\\n      Cases which have this criteria must be operated upon. There is a school of\\n      thought which believes that all nodular goiters should be operated upon\\n      due to the possibility of some nodules being malignant. It is my belief\\n      that these nodules should be removed. Due to the tendency for recurrence\\n      in cases where nodules have been removed, it is good surgical practice to\\n      perform subtotal thyroidectomies in such cases.\\n      \\n (6) Hyperthyroidism or Toxic Goiter -\\n      These cases comprise Graves Disease (exophthalmic goiter) or Parrys\\n      Disease (primary hyperplastic goiter) with or without ophthalmos; Plummers\\n      Disease (toxic anenoma or toxic nodular goiter).\\n      \\n It may be noted here that the onset to\\n      toxic symptoms in Plummers syndrome usually occurs a number of years after\\n      the nodular goiter has been noticed. On the other is more acute in Graves\\n      Disease the thyrotoxic symptoms precede any noticeable enlargement of the\\n      gland. The onset is more acute in Gravers Disease. The goiter in toxic\\n      adenoma is nodular, usually asymmetrical and larger than we see in Graves\\n      Disease. GRavers Disease is seen in younger people, while Plummers Disease\\n      in those who are over 40.\\n      \\n It is believed that a neurohormonal\\n      mechanism is involved in the pathogenesis of toxic goiter. Nervous\\n      impulses stimulate the anterior pituitary to produce an increased output\\n      of thyrotropic or thyroid - stimulating hormone, followed in turn by\\n      increased activity of the thyroid cells, with over - production and\\n      release of thyroid hormone. There is a tendency for spontaneous remission\\n      and intermission, each of which will leave in its wake residual pathology.\\n      It is these cases which produce our mixed types of thyrotoxicosis in which\\n      hyperplastic and adenomatous changes may co - exist.\\n      \\n In a later stage, if hypertrophy and\\n      hyperplasia continue for a sufficient time, a stage of exhaustion from\\n      over - work will occur. The acini of the cells become smaller and\\n      atrophic. Aside from this, there is fibrous tissue replacement of the\\n      parenchyma of the gland. These are the cases which give rise to the so\\n      called \"burnt out\" type of goiter.\\n      \\n In a thyrotoxicosis most frequently\\n      there has been psychic trauma. This is noted in 90 percent of the cases of\\n      Gravers Disease and 40 percent Plummers Disease. However, there previously\\n      must have been a susceptible constitution.\\n      \\n In the symptoms, initially, we find\\n      fatigue and weakness and palpitation eventually running into fibrillation;\\n      and, if not treated, irritability and intolerance of heat, prominence of\\n      the eyeballs and increased sweating. In the female, there may be\\n      disturbances of the menstrual function, usually amenorrhoea; diarrhoea may\\n      be a frequent symptom in these cases.\\n      \\n In the fulminant cases of Graves\\n      Disease you will find that it is the vital organs such as the heart and\\n      liver which break down, rather than the thyroid itself. The thyroid crises\\n      which were common after thyroid surgery were due most often to disturbance\\n      in liver metabolism. The thought that cases of Graves Disease must have\\n      poor nutrition is not actually true. In fact, 4 percent of the cases are\\n      overweight. However, as time goes on, the patient will lose appetite and\\n      then there is ensuing rapid loss of weight. In a number of cases, there is\\n      marked irritability, the patient is restless and ill at ease. There is\\n      body hyper - activity and emotional instability. The mental picture may go\\n      on to a stage of manic - depressive disturbances and it is difficult at\\n      times to distinguish these cases from true psychoses.\\n      \\n Tremor may be so fine that it may only\\n      be detected by placing the tips of your fingers upon the outstretched hand\\n      of the subject. Your thyroid patient has a scared look with an anxious\\n      expression. There may be marked flushing of the face. The ocular changes,\\n      classically Stellwags sign, von Grafes sign and Moebius sign are well\\n      known to all of us. Commonly these signs are bilateral, but they are often\\n      more striking in one eye than in the other or occasionally confined to one\\n      side.\\n      \\n The goiter, on palpation, is usually\\n      smooth, uniformly enlarged and presents a thrill on palpation and a bruit\\n      during auscultation. In the laboratory tests for diagnosis, the basal\\n      metabolic rate is much more important than all the other laboratory\\n      methods. Evaluation of the basal metabolic rate must be made. There are\\n      cases in which a basal rate of plus 15 may be very significant, if it is\\n      known that previously this patient had a lower rate, for instance from\\n      minus 10 to a minus 20. It is found that the serum cholesterol is lowered\\n      in the thyrotoxic patient. Under treatment it is found that with reduction\\n      of the basal metabolic rate, there is an increase in the serum cholesterol\\n      value.\\n      \\n The blood iodine determination is a\\n      valuable test in determining the border line case. The protein - bound\\n      fractions in hyperthyroidism will vary from 8 to 22 gammas per 100 cc.; in\\n      hypothyroidism, the range will be from .0 to 4.0.']\n"
