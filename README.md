# Health_Information

A project in natural language processing.  Here I attempt to lay the groundwork for automatically verifying the likelihood that a website containing health information is trustworthy.  I used similarity metrics to compare the text of articles from MayoClinic and a source of homeopathic articles, homeoint.org.  I used a naive bayes classifier to determine which source randomly selected text from either source came from.  Earlier in this project, I tried to use Word2Vec and Doc2Vec to see a vector could be constructed to classify text, but my understanding of these packages was elementary at the time, so I could not produce meaningful results.

Feel free to browse through my python notebooks!
